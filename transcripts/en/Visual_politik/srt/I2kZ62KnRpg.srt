1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,590
Unless you're living in a cave and your 
only source of news is visual politic,

2
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:13,424
in which case thank you very much.
You probably realize that Fidel Castro 

3
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:18,740
died,
ends with his death.

4
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:19,574
A communist icon disappears.
Fidel Castro ruled over Cuba with an 

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,180
iron fist for over 50 years.
Now,

6
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:28,460
many people,
ones where the Fidelis death will be the

7
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,294
first step in a transition for Cuba,
a transition from a communist 

8
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:37,751
dictatorship to a liberal democracy.
The reality is is that Fidel Castro,

9
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,564
he retired from politics in 2008,
handing over power to his brother Raul 

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,683
Castro,
keeping Cuba really in the family 

11
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:46,724
business.
The truth is that Raul found himself 

12
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:49,154
having to apply several reforms in Cuba.
Reforms that it's not such a long time 

13
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:53,624
ago would have been impossible to 
imagine in a regime that touted itself 

14
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:58,240
as the perfect communist system.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,150
Castro ism is done,
at least the way we know it.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,340
No one really knows what will become of 
Cuba,

17
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:10,120
but one thing is the absolute certain.
It's changing.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,013
Well.
You will ask for a video about Cuba and 

19
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:13,750
you know that here,
a visual politic.

20
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:14,584
We do like to think outside of the box,
so in this video we're answering a very 

21
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,500
important question that we don't believe
has been answered yet.

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,603
Is now a good time to invest in Cuba?
Is it possible to make money out of the 

23
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:29,950
political changes that are expected on 
the island today?

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,813
We're going to answer that question.
History shows us that when an economy 

25
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:38,970
goes from a plan's one to a free market,
one,

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,500
there is a window of time where it's 
possible to make a fortune.

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,870
A good example of this is the Czech 
Republic,

28
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,510
particularly the city of Prague.
Well,

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm making this video.
I am British,

30
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,780
but I live in Prague now.
At the beginning of the 19 nineties,

31
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:55,800
the Czech Republic was opening up its 
economy for the first time after decades

32
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:56,634
of communism.
This means that for the first time in 

33
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:03,501
years you could buy and sell houses.
Not only that,

34
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:09,050
since the country was relatively poor,
the price of property,

35
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:09,884
it was very low.
This attracted a lot of foreign 

36
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,240
investors,
particularly from the north of Italy.

37
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,360
They were buying property for almost no 
money at all.

38
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,920
Then years later,
the Czech economy started growing fast.

39
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,320
Foreign companies came and settled down 
here.

40
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:28,010
Tourism grew and local people started 
companies in a short time,

41
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:31,100
the price of houses doubled and those 
people have invested early,

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,060
became a millionaire.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,200
Very

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,570
similar thing might just happened in 
Cuba,

45
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,290
but hold on just a second because this 
isn't quite as simple as it sounds.

46
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,183
Other former communist countries like 
the Ukraine didn't have the same amount 

47
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:48,080
of luck,
ends more than one investor who invested

48
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:51,320
in post-communist.
Ukraine has gone bankrupt before.

49
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,154
Considering investing in Cuba,
it's important to understand what's 

50
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,184
going on in the country,
what is the nature of the reforms that 

51
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:59,620
are taking place.
But before we get into all of that,

52
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,483
let's take a look.

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,700
Tuition in Cuba today,

54
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,603
Cuba is a communist country.
This means that their whole economy is 

55
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:12,810
directed by the government for some 
clarity in the good times,

56
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:16,290
the Cuban government employees at 92 
percent of the country's people.

57
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,590
This means that almost everyone was 
working in the public sector,

58
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,710
but those were the 19 eighties when Cuba
exported sugar,

59
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:26,760
tobacco and all sorts of fruit to the 
Soviet Union was in 1989.

60
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:29,850
The Berlin Wall came down and Fidel 
Castro lost his trading

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,883
absolutely

62
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:33,803
the US embargo,
which forbids American companies from 

63
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:36,474
doing any kind of business with the 
islands and Cuba was practically 

64
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,044
isolated from the rest of the world.
This resulted in a brutal economic 

65
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:43,884
crisis that lasted until the year 2000.
This was when Hugo Chavez came to power 

66
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:48,384
in Venezuela.
As you can see in another one of our 

67
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:50,694
videos,
Venezuela used to be a very oil rich 

68
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:55,140
country and since Chavez and Castro was 
such good buddies,

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,710
Chavez gave a lot of money.

70
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,743
Castle,

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,080
this was the life raft that we're 
supporting Castro's revolution.

72
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,910
Nevertheless,
in 2013,

73
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,210
oil prices collapsed and so did 
Venezuela's economy,

74
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,450
and of course we have all that money 
drying up and no longer went to Cuba.

75
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,790
Cuba's economy collapsed as well.
Now,

76
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,624
at this time for Dell was already 
retired and his brother Raul had taken 

77
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:20,000
the reins of the country.
Raul Castro realized that Cuba was,

78
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:20,834
once again isolate it and he needed to 
change a lot of things or his country 

79
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,660
was going to get a whole lot.
Wes gastros Chinese reform,

80
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,460
by the way,
just so I should say now,

81
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:36,470
if you're enjoying the music in today's 
video,

82
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,910
it's by a car and composable.
Rick Spelled Rak.

83
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,140
He's from Columbia.
If you like it,

84
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,970
you will find links to his music in the 
description below this video.

85
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,201
All right.
Okay.

86
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,034
Back to 2013,
and Raul Castro and announcing a series 

87
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,770
of reforms in Cuba.
The first reform was the legalization of

88
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:06,240
something called the Quintet Easter's.
This is what we would call a free zone,

89
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,840
and this meant for the first time it 
Cubans could start small businesses.

90
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,390
There would still be a lot of 
restrictions.

91
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,283
For example,
they still couldn't hire anybody and 

92
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:17,550
they could only start a business.
That was one of the types allowed by the

93
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,450
government.
However,

94
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,370
in the three years since these became 
legal,

95
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:21,204
these freelances of grains and 
represents 10 percent of the Cuban 

96
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,414
workforce,

97
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,120
it'd be tuition before people were 
afraid of doing anything private because

98
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,060
government will take it away from that,
but now the government trusts,

99
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,970
they went the protesters because they 
are the future.

100
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,340
Do hold on a moment because there is 
more.

101
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,233
In fact,
Raul Castro seems to be following the 

102
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,143
Chinese Communist Party's playbook,
which by the way is going to be the 

103
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:47,264
topic of another video which we're going
to be launching very soon actually in a 

104
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:50,444
very dung shopping style.
Raul Castro has created his very own 

105
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:54,404
special economic zone.
This is the so called Marielle 

106
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,120
development zone,
so well,

107
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,320
what does this mean?
Well,

108
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,154
in sight,
this his own foreign companies are 

109
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,374
allowed to start businesses that were 
allowed to hire local people and they 

110
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:06,934
were able to trade with less 
restrictions that exist in the rest of 

111
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,124
Cuba.

112
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,100
Fife foreign companies to Cuban and I'm 
mixed.

113
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:20,360
One are the first eight companies in the
Maria Development Zone,

114
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,720
which is to become the main economic 
goals and through Cuba.

115
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,613
Now you might be wondering how is it 
possible that some international 

116
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,434
companies such as the Spanish hotel 
chain are able to operate in Cuba if 

117
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,680
apparently there's a ban on foreign 
companies that,

118
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,543
well,
if you're watching this video from 

119
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,953
somewhere outside of the United States,
then you might well have traveled to 

120
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,820
volunteer at some points.
If that's the case while you were there,

121
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,030
you were probably staying in a best 
seller or Emilia hotel.

122
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,893
Both foreign companies,
so these Spanish companies have been 

123
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,700
operating in the country since the year 
2000,

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,040
but the truth is in order to establish 
themselves on the islands,

125
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,760
both of these companies to partner with 
the Cuban government.

126
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,970
This means that the hotels are owned by 
the local governments,

127
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,930
but the hotel chains have a licensed to 
operate them and they get a share of the

128
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:06,650
profits.

129
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,483
So until now it was impossible to start 
a company in Cuba unless you were in 

130
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,270
partnership with the government.
So the creation of this special economic

131
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:18,650
zone does show a clear trend or trends 
that China's oil in the 19 nineties.

132
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,573
Further to this,
there is a freeing up going on in the 

133
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:21,884
housing markets in just two years,
over 40,000 new homes have been sold in 

134
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,710
Cuba.
Now this doesn't exactly mean the Cubans

135
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:31,090
have private property and the 
transactions do you come with a thousand

136
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,933
restrictions,
but it does highlight that there is a 

137
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:38,591
trend going on in the country.
Now.

138
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,673
The most important change in recent 
times was Obama's announcement that the 

139
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:46,430
trade embargo between the United States 
and Cuba was coming to an end.

140
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,420
The problem is is that still needs to be
passed by the American Congress,

141
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,370
ends with Donald trump being the next 
president.

142
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,550
It's very difficult to predict exactly 
what's going to happen with that deal,

143
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,403
but controlled by Donald Trump.
The Republican nominee for president 

144
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,900
secretly conducted business in communist
Cuba during Fidel Castro's presidency.

145
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,990
Despite strict American trade bands that
made such undertakings illegal,

146
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,750
it's according to interviews with former
trump executives,

147
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,440
internal company records and court 
filings.

148
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,770
Yeah.

149
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,210
If trump were to keep the embargo with 
Cuba,

150
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,960
that's going to be bad news for 
investors who live in the United States.

151
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,843
They would lose out to investors who 
come from other countries which don't 

152
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,670
have such restrictions.
Britain,

153
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:30,900
Australia,
Canada free.

154
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,633
Hold on a second because there's still 
no guarantee that Cuba is going to 

155
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,660
become some sort of free market 
paradise,

156
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:40,494
especially not overnight.
It's not really clear that even if you 

157
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:46,260
were legally allowed to invest in Cuba,
whether that's a good idea or not.

158
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,153
In fact,
there are two potential scenarios that 

159
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,494
could play out.
Yeah.

160
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,530
One option is that they followed the 
model of track as the vacuum,

161
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,393
which is now two countries,
the Czech Republic and or it's possible 

162
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,393
they follow the example of the Ukraine.
Now let's have a look at these two very 

163
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:06,261
different examples.
Czechoslovakia versus Ukraine.

164
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,510
In 1998 tracks of Lakia and the Ukraine 
abandons the Communist system,

165
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,000
but there is a really big difference 
here.

166
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,163
The checks had a revolution called the 
velvet revolution to overthrow their 

167
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,974
dictator and the new government led by 
this guy on the screen now called fat 

168
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:25,650
Slob Harville.
He sends home the old guard who had been

169
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,840
ruling the country meanwhile over in the
Ukraine,

170
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:30,720
despite the fact that then got that 
political independence,

171
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,000
they kept the same old political elite.

172
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,283
The president's Leonid,
Kraftwerk came from the old communist 

173
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,640
party,
but this is not the end of our story.

174
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,340
Just like Ukraine and Czechoslovakia had
plans,

175
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,490
economies where all of the companies 
belonged to the government.

176
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,383
The first step in opening up these 
economies to the wider world was 

177
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:51,260
privatization,
bus,

178
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,123
and this is really important.
Not all privatizations are created 

179
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:56,114
equally.

180
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,513
Yeah,

181
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,403
took all of their biggest companies and 
made a calculation of the economic 

182
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:02,674
value.
Then they divided the economic value of 

183
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,450
these countries into bounce sheets.
If you were a checks,

184
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,610
it does,
then you could buy one of these vouchers

185
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:10,444
for a reasonable price,
something equal to announce a weeks 

186
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,653
average salary.
This is why 80 percent of the eligible 

187
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:19,390
population bought a voucher with this 
paper in your hands.

188
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,313
You have the rights to buy some shares 
in the company in order to help those 

189
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:26,190
who didn't know how to bid for the 
shares for the Czech government.

190
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,043
Encouraged the creation of hedge funds,
these hedge funds advised common 

191
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:31,204
citizens on how to invest intelligently.
I check and was able to go to one of 

192
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:38,530
these hedge funds and say I wanted to 
get some shares in this company and that

193
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:39,350
one exception

194
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,183
right

195
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,623
now,
as you can probably imagine that was a 

196
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:44,964
lot of corruption here,
but it also has a really positive 

197
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:48,654
outcome.
It helps the majority of checks to 

198
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,054
benefits from the privatization of these
national companies and the proof really 

199
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:55,914
is in the pudding,
yet it's 25 years later and the Czech 

200
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,033
Republic is as egalitarian as Germany 
and has a quality of life as high as 

201
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:02,930
anywhere else.

202
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,763
Urine

203
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,620
story in Ukraine,
that's a different matter.

204
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,603
Now,
the Ukraine did also sell these 

205
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:15,830
vouchers,
do that citizens.

206
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,723
If you were re Ukrainian citizen,
you could bid for a voucher and 

207
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:22,280
eventually you were able to use this 
voucher to buy some shares,

208
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,263
but the reality of the matter is that 
the government never got around to 

209
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:28,040
arranging those.
Auctions is only really happens with the

210
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:28,874
smallest and worst of Ukraine's 
companies and the Ukrainians we'll have 

211
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:34,790
to waiting for years.
They had their vouchers in hands,

212
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,823
but they weren't able to do anything 
useful with them and unfortunately 

213
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:38,914
during this same time,
Ukraine was also suffering from record 

214
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:43,600
inflation.
When purchased these vouchers would cost

215
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,434
1,500 American dollars,
but some years later they were being 

216
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,830
exchanged on the black market for as 
little as 10 US dollars.

217
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,430
The average would be sitting at home and
an oligarch would come knocking and he'd

218
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,110
say something like,
Whoa,

219
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,640
what are you going to do with that 
voucher?

220
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,710
It's never going to be worth anything to
you,

221
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,843
tell you what you give it to me and I'll
give you some money that you can 

222
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:09,670
actually use and surprise surprise.
Soon enough,

223
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,504
all of the vouchers were in the hands of
the oligarchs and there's no prizes for 

224
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,610
guessing here,
but yes,

225
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,760
the oligarchs did have some pretty close
connections to the government.

226
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,490
Then decided to auction off.
All of those companies

227
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,463
come.
Only those companies that were 

228
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,204
interesting to the oligarchs were sold,
and that is why Ukraine still has to go 

229
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:32,794
through some privatizations,
but the most important thing to bear in 

230
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,810
mind here is that in present day,
Ukraine,

231
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,943
85 percent of the country's wealth is in
the hands of the 50 wealthiest 

232
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,150
oligarchs.
The result is no political stability and

233
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:48,800
they horrific environment for investing.
Oh,

234
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,670
and that's not to mention the whole war 
with Russia thing.

235
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,910
So if an investor had bought a property 
in Kiev 10 years ago,

236
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,660
they might just be banging their head 
against the wall right about now.

237
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,800
All right,
so let's go back to Cuba.

238
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,693
Here we have some things that resemble 
Czechoslovakia and we have some things 

239
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,440
that resemble Ukraine.
For example,

240
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:11,020
in the US,
you have 2 million Cubans living.

241
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,740
This represents 20 percent of the entire
Cuban population.

242
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,130
These Cuban Americans have been educated
in a democratic system,

243
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,980
and this could help build good 
democratic institutions.

244
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,083
Cuba

245
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,020
does show itself to be the case.
Then Cuba could become a place with rule

246
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,280
of law,
civil rights,

247
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,000
and many opportunities for Cubans to 
lift themselves out of poverty.

248
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,760
So now that we've given you the rundown 
on Cuba and shared our opinion,

249
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,623
we would love to know yours.
What do you think's going to happen in 

250
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:42,044
Cuba?
Do you think they'll follow the path of 

251
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:44,810
the Czech Republic or the path of 
Ukraine?
