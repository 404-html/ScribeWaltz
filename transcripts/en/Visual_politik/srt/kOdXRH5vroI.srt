1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,193
Hong Kong is one of those places that 
probably needs no introduction because 

2
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,900
you already know will have is situated 
in the south of China.

3
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:18,740
Hong Kong is a lively bustling city with
a great deal of contrasts

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,390
in Hong Kong.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,530
It isn't surprising to see ancient 
Lori's running alongside luxury cars.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,393
You'll also see ruins buildings right 
next to fancy modern skyscrapers and 

7
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,130
you'll see top notch restaurants next to
street food cars.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,230
They all do have one thing in common.
They occupy tiny spaces.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,093
This is true whether the location is a 
high ends mold or just a traditional 

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,033
storefronts.
Whatever business you operate in Hong 

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,753
Kong,
the most is made of every single square 

12
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,514
meter.
Hong Kong was one of the biggest 

13
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,610
miracles of the 20th century.
In fact,

14
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:02,420
it was the model Milton Friedman himself
looked at in order to prove his pro free

15
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:03,254
trade thesis.

16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,330
Free market really is obliged to come.

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,040
World Water You,
Hong Kong's population.

18
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,400
It was around 600,000
people.

19
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,660
It has an income equivalent to about a 
quarter of the United Kingdom's 60 years

20
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,070
later and the population now exceeds 7 
million people and the per capita income

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,460
is almost equal to the UK.
When purchasing power is considered,

22
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,040
its GDP is much larger than the one in 
the UK.

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,943
Okay.

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,410
Sixty years.
Hong Kong has not only become the fourth

25
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:37,244
most significant financial center in the
world and one of the 10 most important 

26
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:40,994
markets,
but it has also become a shell sap and 

27
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,274
millions of Chinese citizens through 
escapes the poverty and violence of 

28
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:46,844
Mao's China.
With all the economic development is 

29
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,700
economic freedom is something that you 
can really feel in the air in Hong Kong.

30
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,980
Now,
Hong Kong cannot exactly be considered a

31
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,814
free paradise,
but nowadays it can be considered the 

32
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,664
freest economy in the world and the 
fourth easiest place to do business in 

33
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,594
the world.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,800
Anyway,

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,633
the kings are Hong Kong's economic 
development is going to be discussed in 

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,964
a future video,
but today we're going to focus on the 

37
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,663
politics of Hong Kong and the threats 
against its institutional structure 

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,730
which might even compromise its future 
economic development.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,593
And to do so,
we're gonna have to start by looking at 

40
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:23,964
the great paradox that China is facing,
the paradox which has become something 

41
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,560
of a hallmark for the country.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,990
Ongoing Kong

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,330
was a British colony until 1997 when the
city integrated into China.

44
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:39,164
Again,
it's something that hadn't happened 

45
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,783
since the 19th century.
China was and today remains a 

46
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:44,024
dictatorship,
lacking respect for human rights and 

47
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:46,394
having very few civil liberties.
This forced the governments in London 

48
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:53,720
and Beijing to negotiate a solution.
The citizens of Hong Kong didn't want to

49
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:54,554
lose that fundamental rights,
and London simply couldn't tolerate the 

50
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:59,430
Chinese applying their authoritarians of

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
city

52
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,460
negotiations.
In 1984,

53
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,360
they reached an agreement known as the 
Sino British joint declaration,

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,450
which established for 50 years after the
integration,

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,313
Hong Kong would have a different 
political system than the one in 

56
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:19,780
mainland China.
This meant that after 1997,

57
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,643
Hong Kong became a special 
administrative region where these so 

58
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,270
called basic law replies.
This is a lot of the grants,

59
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,400
its citizens' rights and freedoms that 
would be unimaginable in any other place

60
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,234
in China with the exception of Macau 
which was integrated into China 

61
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,444
following the same model,
the citizens in Hong Kong have freedom 

62
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,600
of speech,
freedom of the press,

63
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,390
freedom of publication,
freedom of Assembly and association,

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,640
and it's even freedom of demonstration.
Further,

65
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,474
Hong Kong has its own currency,
its own immigration policy and customs 

66
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:46,864
policy,
its own police and even has its own 

67
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,070
courts.
So at first things went really well.

68
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,310
Following this policy and the economic 
growth we mentioned earlier,

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,340
certainly did help the citizens cap that
reign free status.

70
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,174
They could apply their own policies and 
Hong Kong became the natural entrance 

71
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,720
for foreign investment into

72
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,653
China

73
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,170
for a few years.
Things started to get rather worse.

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,313
The basic law we mentioned a moment ago 
acknowledges civil rights but not civil 

75
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:20,110
democracy.
In fact,

76
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,830
China has control over the parliaments 
and the city's executive power.

77
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,840
So how did they do this?
Well,

78
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,674
first in Hong Kong,
only half of the MPS are chosen through 

79
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:29,974
the popular vote.
The other half were chosen by a closed 

80
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,770
group formed of entrepreneurs and 
institutions close to China

81
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,730
now watching Jolyon separatists arguing 
for independence from China.

82
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,880
They were excluded from the chamber for 
using offensive language.

83
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,680
There is the head of the executive 
branch,

84
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:50,010
and that's the prime minister who was 
chosen by a committee of 1000,

85
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:50,844
200 people involved or Linkedin,
one way or another to the communist 

86
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:54,690
party.
In addition to that,

87
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,920
all public officials must take an oath 
of allegiance and commitments to China.

88
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,900
Because of this,
there's an argument to be made that some

89
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,030
of these positions are actually in 
legitimate.

90
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,893
Finally,
the Basic Law states that the autonomy 

91
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:09,390
of Hong Kong is subordinate to Chinese 
people's congrats,

92
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,740
special administrative region of the 
People's Republic of China.

93
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,641
However,
the trees,

94
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:24,474
he demanded that from 2017,
the executive chief hat to be chosen by 

95
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:28,964
popular vote,
and this leads us to the part of the 

96
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:31,814
story.
When China started to break their word 

97
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,210
over and over again,

98
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,260
the 31st

99
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,640
of August,
2014,

100
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,060
the national congress in Beijing started
the electoral reform,

101
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,700
which would choose the government chief 
in this special region,

102
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,010
and here was the surprise,
yes,

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,070
Beijing did acknowledge that this should
be chosen by popular vote,

104
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,963
but they could only choose between two 
or three who had been previously 

105
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,090
selected by the Communist Party.
Yes.

106
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:01,924
Some surprisingly,
the Chinese do have a rather different 

107
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:04,844
idea of democracy,
so over the next few days the people 

108
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,430
really started rising up first.
These were protests by students,

109
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,264
some of them as young as 17 years old.
Can you explain to a young educated 

110
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:22,330
students who grew up with full access to
the Internet and the media that they are

111
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:25,190
actually going to have to live under a 
Chinese dictatorship after all

112
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,373
and 2017,
I believe that will be more 

113
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:28,894
demonstrations and protests,
especially under the interface of 

114
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,103
Beijing government,
is just proved the failure of one 

115
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,960
country,
two system

116
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,273
reaction to the authorities to these 
first strikes and mobilizations wasn't 

117
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,700
very friendly.
They decided to use force,

118
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,563
but the results,
it was the opposite of what they were 

119
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:47,010
expecting.
Instead of containing the protests,

120
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:49,020
more and more people took to the 
streets,

121
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,883
moved by the fear of having to remain 
under the rule of Beijing in a short 

122
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:53,814
time,
a huge demonstration developed in the 

123
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,034
center of Hong Kong.
I did many of the organizations occupy 

124
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:59,630
central and scholar Ism,

125
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,040
not only me,
oh well,

126
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,480
let's go home until feel we awake at 
bluff.

127
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,850
Police started using tear gas and pepper
spray to control the protesters,

128
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,470
and the population started using towels,
mosques,

129
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,750
and umbrellas to mitigate the effect of 
the gas.

130
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,613
For this reason,
the protests actually became known as 

131
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:17,260
the umbrella.

132
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,660
You should.
The occupation

133
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,493
of central Hong Kong lasted for 79 days 
and since then the conflict has 

134
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:27,294
continued with some spontaneous 
outbreaks and young people getting more 

135
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:31,980
radical and not just demanding 
democracy,

136
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,490
but demanding independence from China.
This is something,

137
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,680
by the way,
that China has said that they absolutely

138
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:39,960
will not tolerate under any 
circumstances,

139
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,230
even if they have to use military force.
As an interesting aside,

140
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:43,710
hey,
by the way,

141
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,543
China has recently kidnapped five 
librarians in Hong Kong for spreading 

142
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:49,410
ideas against Chinese control of the 
city.

143
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,293
I was visiting my girlfriend in the 
mainland and I was stopped by two 

144
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:55,690
officials at the border.
They took me to a police fan where there

145
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,520
were dozens of policemen waiting up to 
you.

146
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,473
Then I was taken to the police station 
in Schengen when I was held in the 

147
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,620
prisoners compound and interrogated 
largely

148
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,473
because of these protests.
The September 2016 elections were 

149
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:10,430
celebrated as many of the protests 
leaders were chosen as mps.

150
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,283
There are antibodies using pro 
independence positions have opened up 

151
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,210
the conflict door again since September 
two,

152
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:17,044
mps have already been expelled from 
their offices under pressure for 

153
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:19,710
maintenance

154
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,543
China,

155
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,530
and as I mentioned earlier in this 
video,

156
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:43,440
civil rights are only protected in Hong 
Kong until 20,

157
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,274
47 and it seems that every day China's 
involvement in the city grows and grows 

158
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,773
and this does come with a price.
Potential investors in China through 

159
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:52,494
Hong Kong starting to perceive a risk.
This is probably one of the why 

160
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:59,190
Singapore has experienced such strong 
growth in the last few years,

161
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,110
so that's what we think,
but what do you think?

162
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:03,870
Do you think the citizens in Hong Kong 
should fight for their freedom?

163
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:06,510
Do you think China will eventually 
completely controlled Hong Kong?

164
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,970
