1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,800
Alphabet,
Google's parent company and owner of the

2
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:10,980
Youtube platform visit,
negotiating to build a technology center

3
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:14,460
in none other than Saudi Arabia.
Sounds incredible,

4
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,590
but the truth is that since Mohammed bin
Salman,

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,820
the crown prince takeover this country 
has started to change a lot,

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,360
at least much more than everyone would 
have imagined just a few years ago.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,253
So us today.
Let's have a look at what exactly is 

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:27,564
happening in Saudi Arabia.
Do you understand what's happening in 

9
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:39,614
Saudi Arabia?
We need to take a look at that past to 

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,550
see where everything began.
Well,

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,413
first of all,
we need to bear in mind that we're 

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,350
talking about a particularly young 
country.

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,423
Saudi Arabia was formally born in 1932.
Then of course Saudi Arabia was really 

14
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:56,300
different to how it is today.
You see,

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,253
back then,
many oil deposits hadn't yet been 

16
00:00:58,671 --> 00:00:59,504
discovered,
so it was a very poor place that still 

17
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,610
had a spouse,
semi nomadic population.

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,650
The Saudi Arabia was still kind of in 
the Middle Ages.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,023
Now that I think about it,
really a lot of things have actually 

20
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:20,940
changed that much,
but a few years later in 1938,

21
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,640
the first oil deposits were discovered 
and since then,

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,533
well,
let's just say that the house of sounds 

23
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,004
of the country's royal houses used oil 
to make Arabia look like the United 

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,743
States,
at least in terms of aesthetics and 

25
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,484
leisure.

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,580
Well,
allow me to explain myself.

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,443
We're talking for example,
of cities inspired by Dallas' driving 

28
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:42,564
American cars and building huge moles in
the middle of the desert and that's 

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,840
exactly what they did for decades.
That's not only that.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,953
Over the years the Saudi government you 
thanks aisle has begun to have a lot of 

31
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,704
money.
You can do it kind of agreements with 

32
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,330
Washington that has lasted more or less 
until today.

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,193
So check out disagreements.
Saudi Arabia generates a huge and 

34
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,070
relatively cheap oil supply using the 
dollars.

35
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,260
It's basic currency.
I mean,

36
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,240
you've probably heard of petro dollars 
and accumulate all the money,

37
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,290
generates an oil sales in us treasury 
debt or in the Big Wall Street banks,

38
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,253
and if that weren't enough,
the Saudi government is always willing 

39
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,260
to inject millions into the powerful US 
owns industry.

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,240
That is,
that is

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,060
lots of oil,
lots of money and great business for the

42
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,030
US military industry.
So the question becomes,

43
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:35,800
well,
in exchange for watts,

44
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,090
well,
who basically for protection,

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,953
the house of Saudi bought what 
essentially amounts to insurance from 

46
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:48,880
Washington to protect it from foreign 
enemies.

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,250
However,
in 1979,

48
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:52,570
everything changed.
You see,

49
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,404
19,
79 was a fundamental year for Arabian 

50
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:59,560
countries.
And for Islam on the one hand to Islamic

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,000
revolution happens in Iran.
And on the other hand,

52
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,500
the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
And in Saudi Arabia,

53
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:07,510
between November the 20th and December 
the fourth,

54
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,403
a group of fanatics took over the Great 
Mosque of Maca and accuse the house of 

55
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,694
Southie,
Saudi monarchy of betraying Islam and 

56
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:15,784
selling their soul to the west fanatics 
called for an uprising to overthrow the 

57
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,494
royal family.
And that if you are is where everything 

58
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,823
changed,
the house of Saudi leaders feared a 

59
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:28,630
revolutionary uprising and decided to 
please the extremists.

60
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,390
The United States could certainly 
protect them from the foreign enemy,

61
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,253
but it will be very hard for them to do 
soak in a popular uprising like the one 

62
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,003
that happened in Iran.
So even though this part of the world 

63
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,100
wasn't exactly a paradise of freedom 
from that Bermans on,

64
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,800
things got a lot,
lot worse.

65
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,970
Discrimination against women reached 
stratospheric levels,

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,833
they religious.
God began an uncontrolled campaign and 

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,833
Saudi Arabia began to finance all kinds 
of extremist groups like there was no 

68
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,960
tomorrow,
both inside and outside of the country.

69
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,960
And that's precisely the Saudi Arabia.
We'll know how we'll just waste a moment

70
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:08,794
because there was another turning point 
in 2015 this time thanks to you 

71
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:16,720
plummeting oil prices in the arrival of 
a new King Salman Bin Abdulaziz.

72
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,070
Great flavor overall.

73
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,240
This is a king who decided to give 
almost all the power to his son.

74
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:31,360
And now his APP,
Muhammad Bin Salmaan of here.

75
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,820
We already talked about here on visual 
politic before.

76
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,160
That's a new generation,
took a hold of the country.

77
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,623
My generation was held hostage by 1979.
I know now that my kids will not be 

78
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,540
hostages,
one Saudi banker to the New York Times.

79
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,350
Since then,
folks,

80
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,680
a new kind of revolution has been 
launched to modernize the country.

81
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,420
We've already talked about this on this 
channel,

82
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:54,254
but the truth is that the plan is 
advancing at full speed and it's based 

83
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,690
on three pillars.
The fight against corruption,

84
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,120
economic change,
and religious reform.

85
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,740
So without further ado,
well,

86
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,500
let's see what's happening.
Point by point.

87
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,050
Saudi Arabia is anti corruption 
crackdown.

88
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,190
Saudi Arabia detailing 11,
nearly 60 detainees,

89
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:14,120
uh,
promptly removed.

90
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:14,954
We're being told,

91
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,510
sure.

92
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,340
Fight against corruption

93
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,810
the ground.

94
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,810
Brent's has said it both actively and 
passively.

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,290
Corruption in Saudi Arabia is a great 
burden added,

96
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,213
has to rent.
Our country has suffered a lot from 

97
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:36,450
corruption from the 19 eighties until 
today.

98
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,343
The calculation of our experts is that 
roughly 10 percent of all government 

99
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:40,224
spending was siphoned off by corruption 
each year from the top levels to the 

100
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:44,670
bottom.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,

101
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,560
as you know,
was as it was said,

102
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,430
so it was done last November,
that's 2017 prince's businessmen,

103
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:51,810
ministersx,
politicians,

104
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,703
and a huge number of people were invited
to dine with the king or to meet with 

105
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,060
the crown prince.
Of course,

106
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,160
only in a country like Saudi Arabia that
we would see a prison like this.

107
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,710
This is the Ritz Carlton at reacts a 
very,

108
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,340
very luxurious hotel.
Of course,

109
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,250
nos.
Everything was comfortable after all,

110
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,010
it became a prison that held such 
illustrious prisoners as Prince Alwaleed

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,710
bin Talal grandson of the kingdoms own 
founder,

112
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,020
known as the Warren Buffett of the 
Middle East.

113
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,330
This is a prince who,
according to Forbes magazine,

114
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,930
has a fortunate to have almost 
$18,000,000,000 in just one of twitter's

115
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,810
largest shareholders.
Well,

116
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,673
not even he,
even with all this money managed to 

117
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:29,744
escape all the prisoners were held 
incommunicado and couldn't even contact 

118
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,900
their lawyers rights.
Legal guarantees.

119
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,490
Come on,
we're in Saudi Arabia,

120
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,960
but what do you think the Saudi 
government asked for to release them?

121
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,853
Well,
nothing less than giving part of their 

122
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,224
fortunes and companies as compensation 
for all the corruption that they were 

123
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:50,300
involved in as well.
Here's a question.

124
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,330
Do you know how much the Saudi 
government raised with this trick?

125
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,180
This up,
because this is an astounding number.

126
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,103
It wasn't one or five or 10 billion,
but it was approximately an one popping 

127
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,350
$107,000,000,000.

128
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,390
Of course,

129
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,200
a few detractors have accused the crown 
prince of carrying out this campaign,

130
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,063
not with the intention of fighting 
corruption class with the aim of 

131
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:17,930
strengthening his power.
For example,

132
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,970
seizing control of the foreign based 
media.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,833
Yes,
the detainees included important media 

134
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:23,654
businessmen bots have you at this 
doesn't end here also at all the 

135
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:39,191
economic change as we've mentioned on 
visual politics.

136
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:40,984
Saudi Arabia wants to emulate Dubai and 
leave their dependence on oil behinds 

137
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,023
and they want to do it hand in hand with
private capital just as we saw in 

138
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:49,504
Google's case.

139
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,500
Of course,

140
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,333
on the other hand,
as Prince Mohammed bin Salman is also 

141
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:55,884
very fond of big projects.
The last one he publicized was Naomi 

142
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,303
Macro city that the government wants to 
build in the Red Sea next to Jordan and 

143
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,650
Egypt.
Check out some of these numbers,

144
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,710
500 $500,000,000,000 in public and 
private investments in order to urbanize

145
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,460
and build a city that is larger in area 
than El Salvador.

146
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,790
This is a 10,000 square mile place that 
will have its own laws,

147
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,960
its own courts and its own taxes.
This is a new city that the crown prince

148
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:29,920
wants to turn into a great transport hub
as a huge international business center.

149
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,300
Basically a much more modern and much 
bigger Dubai,

150
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,193
and this isn't his only project.
Saudi Arabia plans a huge Red Sea beach 

151
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:41,804
tourism project.
The project will cover 50 islands and 

152
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:48,350
34,000 square kilometers an area bigger 
than Belgium and there's a few more.

153
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,213
Prince's idea is to get all these cities
to have laws and standards different 

154
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:55,830
from those in the rest of the country.
Laws they can attract investors,

155
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,860
attract tourists and entrepreneurs.
The question is,

156
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,723
will really be able to make all of these
projects work in a country that is so 

157
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,410
anchored in the past.

158
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,373
Awesome.

159
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,950
When he's like that,
it doesn't seem easy at first,

160
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,813
but I suppose we'll see so far.
People like Richard Branson certainly 

161
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:16,510
support the strategy,

162
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,730
the religious change,

163
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,210
sleep.
There's the religious changed,

164
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:29,044
the princes latest and great obsession 
is the struggle against Islamic 

165
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,280
fundamentalism or its most radical 
interpretations.

166
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,143
You see,
Saudi Arabia is a country of 

167
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:38,364
restrictions,
which is something we probably all know 

168
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,300
and it may never cease being so.
However,

169
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:43,134
just a few years ago,
nobody could have imagined we'd see so 

170
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:49,950
many changes and quite so quickly 
concerts and movies which had been bands

171
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,830
have returned to the country.
The religious God has lost almost all of

172
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:55,350
its power.
Women can now attend sports stadiums and

173
00:09:55,351 --> 00:10:00,351
since June they can also drive.
I go on any further.

174
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,080
On December the sixth,
2017,

175
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:06,800
the Lebanese singer hereby to start in 
Saudi Arabia first.

176
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,420
All female concepts.
Yes.

177
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,254
Even the audience was entirely made up 
of women and this is something we 

178
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,600
couldn't even have imagined just three 
years ago.

179
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,800
Listen to this reflection,

180
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,510
privileged to be the generation that has
seen the before and the after,

181
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,403
the previous generation of Saudi.
Women could never imagine a day when a 

182
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:27,320
woman could drive and the coming 
generation will never be able to imagine

183
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:28,154
a day when a woman couldn't.
A 30 year old Saudi woman social 

184
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:30,944
entrepreneur to the New York Times.
The person in charge of this entire 

185
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:38,081
process is Mohammed bin Salman.
We aren't restoring Islam to its origins

186
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,840
and our biggest tools are the prophets 
practices.

187
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,540
At the time of the Prophet Mohammed,
there were musical theaters.

188
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,433
There was mixing between men and women.
There's a SPEC for Christians and Jews 

189
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,490
and Arabia.
The first commercial,

190
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:54,760
Judge Medina was a woman.
So if the profit embrace all of this,

191
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,830
do you mean the profit was not a Muslim 
crown?

192
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:58,180
Prince Mohammed bin Salman

193
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,260
for a Saudi Arabian data to say 
something like this,

194
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,780
while the only word is wow,
and by the way,

195
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:07,410
don't think that Saudi Arabia was always
the place it was in the past.

196
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,610
Of course,
it was always a very,

197
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,070
very conservative country to 
conservative.

198
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,850
Certainly not the hell that it became in
1979.

199
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,200
The short,
as you can see,

200
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,300
even though there's still a lot to 
change,

201
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:19,134
things seem to be on the right track.
Although of course there are certainly 

202
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,220
still dark areas.
He Qatar,

203
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,030
blockade failure,
the Yemen war and the princess obsession

204
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,880
with Taran ran

205
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,360
team leader is the new Hitler of the 
Middle East,

206
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,520
but we learned from Europe that 
appeasement doesn't work.

207
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,443
We don't want the new Hitler in Iran to 
repeat what happened in Europe in the 

208
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,610
Middle East,
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

209
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,530
This prince is a take charge kind of 
man,

210
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,373
but to tell the truth so far,
his international attempts have been 

211
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,883
resounding failures as we saw with Yemen
and other problem is that the Arabic 

212
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:52,980
countries,
economies are going from bad to worse.

213
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,870
In 2017,
they suffered that first recession since

214
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,930
2009 and public deficit is still 
skyrocketing,

215
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,420
growing by more than $50 million dollars
every year,

216
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,840
and of course that can make it hard for 
the prince to carry out his plants.

217
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,160
In any case,
having seen this,

218
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:09,610
I think we can say that the oil was some
of the best news for everyone,

219
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,590
especially for Saudi Arabian women,

220
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,600
turning to what we have done before,
a country of moderate Islam that is open

221
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,434
to all religions and to the world.
We will not spend the next 30 years of 

222
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:21,910
our lives dealing with destructive 
ideas.

223
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,940
We will destroy them today.
We will end extremism very soon.

224
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,080
Mohammed bin Salman.

225
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,500
Anyway,
that's how things are,

226
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:30,350
but now it's your turn.
Do you think Saudi Arabia will manage to

227
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,370
change itself?
Well,

228
