1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:08,863
Donald trump,
president of the United States and the 

2
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:11,864
world's most powerful man.
A lot has been said about his auntie 

3
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:14,924
liberal agenda,
but the question today is can he really 

4
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,480
put it all into place?
The bigger question here,

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,400
the how powerful is the presidents of 
the United States?

6
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:23,234
Really?

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:25,950
Let's have a look at it

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,783
as an example,
Donald Trump would get up one morning 

9
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:29,304
and launched a couple of nuclear 
warheads to another country without 

10
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,310
passing.
A congress can listen,

11
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:35,144
is all the supreme court stop the 
massive deportations that he's proposed 

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,810
during his campaign.
Don't forget,

13
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:43,440
it's a democracy in the United States,
congratulates itself Fur.

14
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:48,441
It's clear distinction between executive
judicial and legislative branches.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,733
This system of checks and balances once 
designed to prevent an eventual 

16
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:57,600
psychopath from taking over the country 
and it's creating chaos like seizing the

17
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,434
power that he was given,
buying the citizen with this system in 

18
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:04,384
place.
The presidents of the United States or 

19
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,723
Otis has a lot of authority to do things
unilaterally without having to ask 

20
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,270
permission of any court parliaments and 
believe you me,

21
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:16,480
some of these things are pretty darn 
scary today.

22
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:17,314
In this video,
we're going to tell you about some of 

23
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:18,904
the things that Donald Trump can do by 
himself and we're doing it along with 

24
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:22,384
our friend Eric [inaudible].
Eric is the cofounder of reconsider 

25
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:25,894
media,
one of the most influential political 

26
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:29,020
podcasts in America.

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,630
Hello Simon and hello to all the visual 
politics subscribers.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,250
That's the nuclear football exists.

29
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,020
The answer is,
Oh yes,

30
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:44,150
it does,
because when you play Football,

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,840
Aka the Doomsday Boston does exist.
In fact,

32
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,540
it's carried in the briefcase that we're
showing in the picture.

33
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,543
Yeah.

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,133
President presses that button.
He's sending an order to to US army 

35
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,154
officials.
Usually lieutenants were stationed 

36
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,380
aboard a combat jet that has a nuclear 
weapon.

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,500
Each of these lieutenants has a key.
When they turned those keys,

38
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,000
at the same time they deploy and launch 
the nuclear weapon.

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,353
Be Wondering,
is it required that Congress passed a 

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,940
law or some kind of special order in 
order to launch that nuke,

41
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,983
and the answer is a resounding no.
The presidents can give the order to 

42
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:30,960
launch and you just about any time he 
wants.

43
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,153
Just like

44
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,523
resident could push the button all by 
himself or herself legally and 

45
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:42,140
constitutionally speaking,
physically,

46
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,200
military personnel would need to carry 
out the strike.

47
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,363
Of course,
any military officer ignoring a 

48
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:49,274
presidential order would be an opening 
subordination subject to dismissal and 

49
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:54,560
court martialed.

50
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,120
All of this comes from the time of the 
Cold War.

51
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,380
The United States felt existentially 
threatened by the Soviet Union.

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,333
They worried that eventually the Soviets
would be able to nuke any American city 

53
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,220
at any time.
If this would be the case,

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,293
the United States.
We need to be able to react with the 

55
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:22,311
retaliatory strike immediately.
There wouldn't be time for debate in the

56
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,323
House of Representatives.

57
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,140
Hold on a minute here because there is 
much more.

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,040
Imagine Donald Trump wakes up one 
morning and Zinzi isn't a big fan of the

59
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,874
Chinese people.
He decides to launch a new gas in 

60
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,340
Beijing.
From a legal and constitutional point of

61
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,500
view,
he is allowed to do so,

62
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,590
but this isn't going to be for free.
In this example,

63
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,424
launching a bombing against China would 
violate several international treaties 

64
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,610
as well as agreements between the United
States and China.

65
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,473
This means the US Congress would ask him
for an explanation or even call for a 

66
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,410
vote to decide whether he should be 
kicked out of the Oval Office or not.

67
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,543
This is a process called impeachment and
it comes into effect when the 

68
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,564
president's breaks a law,
including treaties that the US has 

69
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:13,270
agreed to.
Former presidents like Richard Nixon are

70
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,104
rather familiar with this process.
This is not the ends of things though 

71
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,124
because there is far more than nukes in 
America's arsenal and a state of 

72
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:33,144
emergency,
so can Donald Trump declare war on 

73
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:38,850
another country all by himself?
However,

74
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:39,684
in cases of emergency,
the president can actually send troops 

75
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,523
into another country without a 
declaration of war by Congress ahead of 

76
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:48,264
time.
Here's thing

77
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,223
example,

78
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,183
President Obama is facing criticism that
crosses the political divide for not 

79
00:04:57,601 --> 00:05:02,550
seeking congressional authorization 
before ordering the American military to

80
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,384
join in attacks,
tax of Libyan earth defenses and 

81
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:06,594
government forces.
This means that if trump wanted to send 

82
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,380
troops to a country like Iran,
for example,

83
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:12,960
you can absolutely do it,
but you can only do it for 60 days.

84
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,823
After that 60 day period,
he has to report to Congress and gets a 

85
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:17,574
vote declaring war.
This would mean an extended military 

86
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:20,724
presence in the territory,
so this means that you can send troops 

87
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:23,484
to a country if it's an emergency,
but you can't send them there if you 

88
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,200
want them to stay for longer.
In that case,

89
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,780
you do need Congress to approve this.
Nonetheless,

90
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,140
once Congress has declared a declaration
of war,

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,980
the president has the power to 
micromanage the war,

92
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,380
however they want.
Nonetheless,

93
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,230
once Congress has passed a declaration 
of war,

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,330
the president as commander in chief has 
the power to micromanage the war,

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,313
however they can.

96
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,130
Nonetheless.

97
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,010
Last one is congress has passed a 
declaration of war.

98
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,870
The president is unable to micromanage 
the warfare,

99
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,733
the as much as he wants.
This means the president can give very 

100
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:06,860
specific and detailed orders.
If you remember the capture of Osama bin

101
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,250
Laden that was directed by President 
Obama in self,

102
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,530
and then there they're also the many 
drone strikes.

103
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,670
The President Obama also watered 
himself.

104
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,350
Let's now move on from warfare and let's
talk a little bit about economics.

105
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,710
Well,
to the free trade agreements,

106
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,400
when it comes to the economy,
almost all domestic policies do you have

107
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:30,610
to go through congress.
If Donald trump wants to raise taxes,

108
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:31,444
it would require a legislative votes.
The same happens if he wants to 

109
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:36,880
liberalize one industry or nationalized 
another.

110
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,773
In many cases,
he might face the Supreme Court or even 

111
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,043
individual states who have their own 
power to stop some actions and that's 

112
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,780
something we're actually going to be 
covering in an upcoming video.

113
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,643
Nonetheless,
that is an area where Donald Trump will 

114
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:50,704
have power to act.
However you want international trade 

115
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,900
agreements,
and this is really no small matter,

116
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,950
US companies buy and sell goods and 
services all over the world,

117
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,903
and these commercial relationships are 
regulated through international 

118
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:04,744
agreements.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,450
Yes,

120
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,783
many governments have special taxes 
which are called tariffs on foreign 

121
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:13,324
goods.
In order to avoid these countries can 

122
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:18,040
sign what they call a free trade 
agreement.

123
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,953
You're in North America,
we have the Nafta Treaty or the North 

124
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,603
American Free Trade Association,
which allows for forms of free trade 

125
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:27,690
between the United States,
Canada,

126
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,230
and Mexico.
Now this law is 20 years old and because

127
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:32,064
it's already on the books,
Donald Trump cannot unilaterally break 

128
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,354
it or change it in any major way.
You would need congress to pass a new 

129
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,240
law in order to make change.

130
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,743
Nevertheless,
they're all two other big treaties that 

131
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:53,600
were negotiated by Barack Obama that are
still to be passed through congress.

132
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,320
The first is the TPP.
This allows a form of free trade between

133
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,213
America and Asia and Oceania.
The other risk of the TT ip which opens 

134
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,180
commerce with the European Union.
These treaties were almost done.

135
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,043
They just needed to be passed by the 
American Congress as well as the 

136
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:10,970
legislative bodies of some other 
countries.

137
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,863
However,
the American constitution says that any 

138
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:14,264
president can renegotiate or cancel any 
international treaties before they have 

139
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,034
been voted on by Congress,
and even if they were approved by the 

140
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:25,340
legislature,
you could still choose not to sign it if

141
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:28,220
he didn't sign it.
This would be called a veto,

142
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,143
and as you probably well know,
trump is no big fan of free trade and 

143
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:32,780
the TPP failed.

144
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,733
GPP is a horrible deal.
It is a deal that is going to lead to 

145
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:38,494
nothing but trouble.
It's a deal that was designed for China 

146
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:44,990
to come in as they always do through the
backdoor and truck.

147
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,990
Totally take advantage of everyone.

148
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,670
In fact,
the president can veto any law passed by

149
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,960
Congress,
however,

150
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:56,961
he can only veto the whole law or and 
send it back to Congress.

151
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,373
He cannot pick and choose what parts of 
the Walgett past once it's sent back to 

152
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,234
Congress.
If Congress wants to pass it over the 

153
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:06,324
veto,
they would have to vote for it with a 

154
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,140
two thirds majority,
but of course,

155
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,580
the main area where Donald Trump would 
like to use this super as presidents is

156
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,103
great.

157
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,800
This was the most hated,
yes,

158
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,643
most repeated word in donald trump's 
speeches during his entire election 

159
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,030
campaign.
Nonetheless,

160
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:30,420
he almost has no executive powers with 
which and can act on this matter

161
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,353
in order to build the wall.
Trump actually needs congressional 

162
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:35,314
approval because at the end of the day,
it's a major civil construction 

163
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:39,964
projects,
so it needs a budget which congress 

164
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:45,160
passes and it also needs big land 
allocations,

165
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,860
which he needs Congress to acquire as 
well.

166
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,783
If he's going to build the wall without 
the permission of any other American 

167
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:53,494
institution,
he actually has to get not only Mexico 

168
00:09:56,441 --> 00:10:00,280
to pay for the wall,
but also to build the wall with in their

169
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:01,114
own border.

170
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,210
This is again something that we're going
to be talking about lazy

171
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,130
now,
the American system only that's trump.

172
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:11,964
Do one thing or to the Department of 
Homeland Security to prioritize the 

173
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:16,434
deportation of illegal immigrants,
but you know what's particularly 

174
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,150
interesting about this and what the 
problem is,

175
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,980
and that's the Boma.
Well,

176
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,843
he already did that.
Doesn't had Obama Administration so 

177
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,460
strange as it sounds when it comes to 
illegal immigration.

178
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,760
Trump's administration is expected to 
follow the steps of it promise.

179
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,760
This is our opinion here.
Revisional,

180
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,623
politic,
and now we'd love to know what you 

181
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,304
think.
Do you think that the president should 

182
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:48,954
be able to meet so many unilateral 
decisions without having to go through 

183
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:52,434
Congress?
You think it's kind of scary that one 

184
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,534
person has the authority,
didn't nuke whatever country you'd 

185
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:56,894
wants?
Well,

186
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,730

leaving us a comment below.
