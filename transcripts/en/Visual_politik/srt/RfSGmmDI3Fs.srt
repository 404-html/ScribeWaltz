1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,873
Funny.
It's [inaudible] has become the biggest 

2
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:04,470
threat to the euro zone.
Why is this?

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,304
Well,
that's what we're going to tell you in 

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:06,834
this video.

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,240
[inaudible]

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,320
the cradle of the West,
the place of pastor pizza and pop.

7
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,530
You like coffee making techniques like 
the Cappuccino,

8
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:23,050
ristretto and espresso.
It's all in SLA,

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,560
but in addition to this,
it's really,

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,250
it has become quite a headache for 
Europe's leaders.

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,121
No ones are,
I mean,

12
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:32,230
we're talking about a giant of the could
turn into a true titanic.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,893
Okay?

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,860
We're talking about an economic and 
financial crisis that could make greases

15
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,140
crisis look like child's play.
See,

16
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:46,320
it's only currently has the eighth 
largest economy in the world,

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,183
but this country isn't growing.
It's banking system has loads of 

18
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:52,110
problems and it is.
Governments is hugely in debt.

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,003
In fact,
this is at least public debt already 

20
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,624
surpasses 130% of its GDP,
which means that even though it has the 

21
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,720
fourth largest economy in the European 
Union off to Germany,

22
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:01,554
the United Kingdom and France,
it also has the largest public debt 

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,943
stock.
This amounts to more than two point $5 

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,753
trillion.
The Italian public debt folks is twice 

25
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:11,094
the size of the entire Mexican economy.
I'd almost four times the size of the 

26
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:18,780
Swiss economy and that's if you didn't 
figure out is a lot of it.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,633
Money

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,520
Prolo doesn't even begin to end that the
Italian economy is hardly growing.

29
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:33,710
In fact,
it hasn't managed to get back to its pre

30
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:35,960
2008 crisis levels.
Unemployment,

31
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,280
it's a pass is 10% and youth 
unemployment lies at around 40%

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,633
total of this.
We need to add the fact that year after 

33
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,034
year,
public debt continues to rise and it 

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,133
won't stop growing.
The country has a very big population 

35
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,790
with an agent problem and above all,
the European Central Bank,

36
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,140
which in recent years has been Italy's 
largest public debt purchaser could soon

37
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,063
stop doing that.
European Central Bank says it's massive 

38
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:05,340
bond buying program will likely end in 
December.

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,820
All of that said,
we can easily understand news like this.

40
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,320
Italy is pushing Europe to the brink of 
another economic crisis.

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,180
The Italian crisis that is making the EU
tremble worsens.

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,073
All right.
Is there something you might not be 

43
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:20,010
wondering?
Well,

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,790
yes,
Simon,

45
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,500
I get it,
but this is hardly new.

46
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,790
It's at,
he's been a problem for ages.

47
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,650
Why we spotlighting it now?
Well,

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,920
I'm going to tell you government a step 
back after months of uncertainty,

49
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:44,310
a new government finally gained power in
June of 2018 and we're not talking about

50
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:45,150
just any governor

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,133
that's

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,380
led by the new prime minister just sat 
by [inaudible].

53
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:50,214
We're talking about a government formed 
by the euro skeptic and antisystem 

54
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:53,814
movement,
fivestars ends by La Liga and extremely 

55
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,354
far right wing party.
This new coalition arrived with a very 

56
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:02,620
clear idea in mind.
It's at least sovereignty would again be

57
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,454
in room and not in Brussels,
which in most cases wouldn't mean 

58
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,620
anything except a higher expense.

59
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,510
Well,
the fact is that as you know,

60
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,490
the countries that belonged to the euro 
zone,

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,000
that is those that share the same 
currency agree on certain goals with the

62
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,834
European authorities as well as on some 
maximum public deficit levels and on a 

63
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,010
path of these deficits have to follow 
over the years.

64
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,903
All of this is done to maintain their 
stability and solvency and thus reduce 

65
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,760
the risk of crisis.
Well,

66
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,730
the new Italian government does not like
this one yet.

67
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,780
Deficit path,
I mean,

68
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,520
come on now.
You're not going to tell me how to spend

69
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:40,590
my money.
Europe,

70
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,463
and this is more or less what the new 
government must have fought because one 

71
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:44,974
of the first things they did was present
a budget proposal in September for a 

72
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,700
public deficits that is substantially 
larger than the one they committed to in

73
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,550
Brussels.
And that is when the earthquake happens,

74
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,383
it'll eat,
defies the European Union and increases 

75
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,614
their deficits.

76
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,483
2.4%
of GDP and you have government wanting 

77
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,544
to spend money that they,
and he's got a public debt problem and 

78
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,214
now they want to ask for a higher dance.
Well I'm seeing is believing because 

79
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,530
folks 2.4%
might sound low,

80
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,423
but if we take the facts that the 
Italian economy is forecasted to not 

81
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,920
grow more than 1% in the upcoming years 
into accounts,

82
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,130
then things really do change because 
that 2.4%

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,470
now means that with every year that 
passes,

84
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,020
Italy will become less solvent.
That is,

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,140
it will be even less able to pay off its
debts.

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,033
So do you know what came of this 
dialogue between the new euro skeptic 

87
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,000
governments in Brussels?
Well,

88
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,170
since just on says new governments 
orientation was exposed,

89
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,004
the 10 year Italian bonds profitability 
sorted by more than 90% that is 

90
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:44,294
investors now understand that there's a 
very high risk and therefore they 

91
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:49,550
require a higher profitability if 
they're going to lend them money.

92
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,790
Obviously this means that every time the
Italian government issues debt,

93
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,624
it has to include higher interest.
Cleans that up to the year 2020 it's 

94
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:02,330
only we'll have to face debt maturities 
of almost $600 billion and a balance.

95
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,830
Of course it'll have to request again 
from the markets along with the deficits

96
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,600
that it has accumulated.
Until then,

97
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,670
this amounts to more than $700 billion,
which is an insane number.

98
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,693
Well,
it hit investors ask for more 

99
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,340
profitability.
Interests will be higher and so will the

100
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,174
public deficits and if in addition,
the European central bank stops buying 

101
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:25,280
debt,
it could mean even higher interest rates

102
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,114
to the point that this spiral cup at the
Italian government's on the ropes and 

103
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,250
then its banks as fault,
they own a good part of it are these dat

104
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,173
also.
It doesn't really seem likely that they 

105
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:35,060
will be able to withstand a new 
recession.

106
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,453
Italy's banks stumble into a new crisis 
and of course that's not all Italy is 

107
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,493
Greece.
It's huge size cause me the spread of 

108
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:46,400
that financial crisis throughout the 
entire euro zone.

109
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,630
That's why the new Italian government's 
policies have led to so much concern.

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,440
Italy is a time on the could simply 
explode at any moment.

111
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,930
That's why it doesn't seem likely that 
the European Central,

112
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,183
we'll stop funding the party.
The only reason Italy isn't already 

113
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,494
rated junk is because the readings 
agencies assume the ECB will step in to 

114
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,370
prevent a default.
In that sense,

115
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,360
Italian bonds are actually German bonds.
John Rubino.

116
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,740
The question now is,
well,

117
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,620
how long can the situation last,
but now that we know what's happening,

118
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,960
the question that remains is how did we 
get to this point?

119
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,853
Well,
listen,

120
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,110
origin of the problem,

121
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,140
awesome.

122
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,470
Long ago we dedicated to video to you 
how Italy arrived at the situation.

123
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,200
We can basically summarize it as a lack 
of competitiveness.

124
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,123
Yes,
Italian politicians really didn't care 

125
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,330
about the economy while for well changed
at full speed.

126
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,203
Italy punished companies with extremely 
high taxes and lots of regulations and 

127
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:47,924
that's what all the states kept hiring 
more and more officials and spending 

128
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,640
money without really caring about the 
results.

129
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,503
For example,
any one in five young Italians gets a 

130
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:55,874
university degree or race.
That's almost half of the ovc d average 

131
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,653
as of course,
if you aren't educating your youth and 

132
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,960
forget about being competitive,
well,

133
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:03,794
what else can you expect?
If that weren't enough by adopting the 

134
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,874
euro,
Italian politicians can no longer use 

135
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,870
one of their favorite tricks,
devaluing the currency.

136
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,140
So this folks,
this is what explains the dark news that

137
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,520
we occasionally see in the media.

138
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,730
As you can probably see the situation,
it's all rather complicated.

139
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,564
And here are visual politic.
We're going to try and keep up with all 

140
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,870
the events.
But now as your time,

141
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,960
do you think that the Italian government
should break with Brussels?

142
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:27,794
Well,
leave your answer in the comments below 

143
