1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,753
Located in the Persian Gulf because 
Howard is a country with an area of a 

2
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,990
little more than 10,000 square 
kilometers,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,690
just to give you some idea of just how 
small that is.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,793
Nearly 40 times smaller than California,
so when this country got its 

5
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:24,540
independence from the UK in Nineteen 71 
guitar was a faraway,

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,600
hostile and very,
very poor place.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,750
As a matter of fact,
it was one of the poorest territories of

8
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:34,230
the United Kingdom and well that kind of
made a lot of sense.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,123
The Guitar Peninsula is a place where 
temperatures can reach 50 degrees 

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,680
Celsius in summer.
It's almost completely covered by desert

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,130
and it was certainly one of the most 
uninhabitable places on earth,

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,993
but it didn't stay that way forever.
And today guitar is the richest country 

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,920
on the planet.
Well,

14
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:52,350
that's right to the citizens of this 
tiny nation.

15
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:57,351
Enjoy a per capita income of more than 
$125,000,

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,260
which is almost three times the income 
in France.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,930
And to follow your time is that found in

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,903
really.

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,610
This is a country which was almost 
uninhabited.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,850
A country third could hardly survive on 
it's fishing industry,

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,120
and today it looks something like 
scrooge mcduck safe

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,253
governments,
government investments and properties 

23
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,350
all around the world,
the birthplace of Alpha zero,

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
the most important Arabic media company.
Well then there was Doha,

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,283
the capital,
which is a sea of skyscrapers and 

26
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:40,560
luxurious cars,
a mix of Monaco in vegas,

27
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:43,530
but without the alcohol and gambling,
there's no room for simplicity.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,513
Everything is sumptuous,
huge and sparkling in Doha on how 

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,853
Sausalito conflict areas reporter gets,
has gone from being a dark shelter for 

30
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:53,310
what harvest preachers and has become a 
watch.

31
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,790
People might consider the most open 
country in the Middle East.

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,550
This is of course excluding Dubai birds.
As you might know,

33
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:04,551
Dubai is an emirate and not actually a 
country something Doha.

34
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,640
We can find international universities 
or the Falls Church city,

35
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,410
a complex of Protestant Orthodox and 
Catholic churches like the Church of our

36
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:19,580
lady rosary million dollar Catholic 
Church,

37
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,443
which seats 2,700 is located in the 
southern outskirts of the city on land 

38
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:28,790
donated by seek Hamad bin Khalifa.
Funny Qatar's emir.

39
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,683
So now the question of course has to be 
how did Qatar achieve this remarkable 

40
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,670
transformation?
Well,

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,533
let's take a look at

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,090
that.
The

43
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,960
LNG blessing,
liquefied natural gas.

44
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,933
In other videos we have discussed the 
keys as to why some countries are so 

45
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:46,964
rich,
but in this case it is much simpler and 

46
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:51,500
it can be summarized.
Blink two things.

47
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,820
Oh,
bands.

48
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,160
More importantly,
natural gas,

49
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,340
a massive,
massive amounts of natural gas.

50
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,573
That really is pretty much it.
If you'll just voice it will just hold 

51
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,380
on a second because it's actually quite 
an interesting story

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,273
already.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,590
The fields they were found in the 19 
forties and by the 19 sixties,

54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,453
exploitation was already consolidators 
and things in the poor country of Qatar 

55
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,180
changed,
but not really that much.

56
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,810
The thing is that it wasn't until the 
beginning of the 19 seventies that shell

57
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:22,644
founds the biggest treasure of this 
country and that would be the north 

58
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,764
fields,
which is the largest gas field in the 

59
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:29,754
world

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,760
at that time.
Well,

61
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,130
natural gas,
it just wasn't that profitable.

62
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,060
You see at the time gasket only be 
transported through gas pipes and guitar

63
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,940
was far from places where this gas could
be used.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
Even Shell,
well,

65
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,034
they soon forgot about it,
but well things they were really about 

66
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:51,590
to change in 1996,
the older male,

67
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,360
bin Khalifa,
al tiny,

68
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:58,220
who abdicated in 2013 staged acute atar 
while his father was in Switzerland.

69
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,250
This Amir reached our with a clear idea 
and that was the future of guitar was in

70
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,243
gas.
They simply had to exploit their huge 

71
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,720
gasfields man so well.
He did just that.

72
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,560
The new mayor decided to invest in an 
undeveloped Andrew rare technology.

73
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,390
This technology,
it's liquefaction,

74
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,200
which is the ability to carry natural 
gas in its liquid form so that it can be

75
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:21,050
transported in large ships as if it was 
oil.

76
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,913
In order to do this,
the gas needed to cool down and be kept 

77
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:26,990
at a temperature of minus 161 degrees 
Celsius,

78
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,853
which is minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit.
Now this is something that is pretty 

79
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,830
inconvenient to do

80
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,983
so well.
I could tell they decided to invest 

81
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,803
enormous quantities of resources in 
order to boost the development of this 

82
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:45,650
technology so that it can be used on a 
massive scale.

83
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,543
Because of that as investments.
Guitar is now the world's largest 

84
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:50,970
exporter of LNG.
With this technology,

85
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,620
guitar is able to export its enormous 
gas supplies to the rest of the world.

86
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,670
In fact,
last year,

87
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,760
three quarters of guitars,
gas went to Asian countries like China,

88
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,870
India,
South Korea,

89
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:00,704
and Japan as well.
There's more because the industrial 

90
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:04,820
complex that guitar has developed is so 
big,

91
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:05,654
so large scale that the country has 
managed to have the cheapest costs of 

92
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:12,440
extraction and liquefaction in the 
entire world.

93
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,400
To illustrate this,
a 10 career,

94
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,243
LNG is four times cheaper and guitar 
than it is in the United States and 

95
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,560
this,
well,

96
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:24,440
that's the secret of this small and 
wealthy country.

97
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,363
But this,
you know,

98
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,110
there's only a part of the equation.
I mean,

99
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,050
not only does the country have to 
exploit the resources they have,

100
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,430
but they also need to use that money to 
generate other money or they're going to

101
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:38,600
end up like Angola or Venezuela.
So besides this innovative process,

102
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:41,030
guitar has some other keys to their 
success,

103
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,903
star power,

104
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,260
some

105
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,210
odd bin.
Kalief Jatani reached power in 1995.

106
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,133
Things they have changed significantly 
and is 18 years leading the country 

107
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,243
Qatar's population.
It's multiplied by while at the same 

108
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,190
time it's become the richest country on 
it.

109
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,133
Yeah,

110
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,820
the older mayor,
he's got plenty of reasons to feel proud

111
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:11,654
of himself.
But let's move on from this because it 

112
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,540
started to generate a lot of economic 
resources and the question now is,

113
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,680
well,
what are they doing with this money well

114
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,514
spent would it may look like they've 
actually mostly invested it both 

115
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,490
nationally and internationally.
It's hard.

116
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,700
They've created the Qatar Investment 
Authority,

117
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,570
which is a huge funds to invest money 
all around the world.

118
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,463
It is known as guitars power because 
they have in their hands more than 

119
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,733
$330,000,000,000.
And when you consider that the 

120
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:42,890
population of guitar is less than 3 
million people,

121
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:46,870
but if those 3 million people,
only 300,000 citizens,

122
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,670
well you can do the math.
This fund,

123
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,060
it has made significant real estate 
investments all over the world.

124
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,040
A big part of the city belongs to Qatar 
and including offices,

125
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,760
hotels,
apartments and swell.

126
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:04,630
In the United States,
guitar was in 2016.

127
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,310
The fourth largest office investor in 
the country in Manhattan alone.

128
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,173
This fund is invested $5,000,000,000 in 
the last two years and they're not just 

129
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:17,350
investing in real estate.
This funds also has major shares in many

130
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:18,980
multinationals.
It gets on this,

131
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,863
for instance,
one of the largest shareholders of 

132
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:23,530
companies like Volkswagen,
Iberdrola,

133
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,810
Barclays Bank,
tiffany and co Shell,

134
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,673
or even the judge,
rough snaps the oil company of the 

135
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:30,850
Russian governments.
In the image I'm about to show you,

136
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,684
you can see how much foreign investment 
has increased as the production of gas 

137
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:35,710
and oil has grown

138
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,220
pants.

139
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,620
It's not just international investments 
here.

140
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,040
They're also investing lots of resources
inside the country.

141
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,770
Tens of billions has been spent on 
highways,

142
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:48,850
ports,
airports,

143
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,890
research centers,
financial centers,

144
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
etc. Etc.
So you might bE asking now,

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,930
what's the goal of all of this?
Well,

146
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:56,764
that is to be able to in the future,
replace the income they get from island 

147
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:00,454
gas,
with income from all of these 

148
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:02,734
investments versus you know what?
The moment when the gas business runs 

149
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:07,520
out is still too far away to really be a
problem.

150
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,650
No analysts who can say when demand for 
gas,

151
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:12,484
we'll wait for oil.
There are people who See peak demand 

152
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:15,970
demanded 20,
30 others in 20,

153
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:16,804
42,
but for gas demand is constantly 

154
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,564
growing.
This idea they have of investing rather 

155
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:21,844
than spending the money from natural 
resources might be at one of the most 

156
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:25,264
important differences between Qatar and 
other countries who are also rich in 

157
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:30,880
natural resources.
Most of them,

158
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:32,500
they find it too easy to spend the 
money.

159
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:33,334
Today.
Man's not think too much about the 

160
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:39,841
future effective independent

161
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,290
when someones

162
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,120
been kelly for our tiny reached power.
He also had another thing in mind,

163
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Qatar.
It had to gain international influence.

164
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,230
You see,
for years,

165
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,240
guitar was controlled.
A de facto bike.

166
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:58,800
Saudi arabia under the new amir just 
couldn't forget about iraq's invasion of

167
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,020
Kuwait.
If gasol wanted to survive,

168
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,130
they needed to claim their identity and 
gain international influence.

169
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,113
Otherwise any conflict with radar could 
compromise the independence of the 

170
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:12,600
country besides well natural gas,
it could pay the bills now,

171
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,690
sorry,

172
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,690
in 2003 when Saudi Arabia or requested 
that the u s take american troops out of

173
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:24,684
that country guitar,
didn't hesitate to offer itself as a 

174
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,224
destination for those trips.
They didn't even blink when it came to 

175
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:35,400
spending about $8,000,000,000 to build 
the military bases that were needed.

176
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,353
Yes,

177
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,473
brawling based 20 miles southwest of the
qatari capital of doha is home to some 

178
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:47,480
11,000 us military personnel.
Indeed,

179
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:48,314
it could be said that Qatar has taken 
out a very comprehensive insurance 

180
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,620
policy and then we have the founding of 
al jazeera.

181
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,410
this has the objective of obtaining 
global influence bands.

182
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,244
Well,
they succeeded and this is something we 

183
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,470
actually covered in a previous video 
that you should definitely check out.

184
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,790
They also developed a foreign policy 
driving towards international influence

185
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,803
blockade.

186
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,273
All this political strategy made both 
the United Arab Emirates and Saudi 

187
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Arabia very angry and in june of 2017,
they announced a blockade accusing Qatar

188
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,010
of supporting fundamentalist groups and 
terrorists,

189
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,903
and when it comes to Saudi Arabia,
we could definitely call this a case of 

190
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,640
the pot calling the kettle black.
Now,

191
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,070
it is true that Qatar has some dark 
secrets.

192
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:38,050
I mean it is an absolute monarchy after 
all,

193
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,600
but the country is a good ally for the 
west,

194
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,463
especially the United States,
and it's also one of the most open 

195
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:46,150
countries in the region.
The truth is that the boycotts,

196
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,570
it had a different target to cut down 
guitars,

197
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:52,650
strategy of international influence,
and to essentially put them back in that

198
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,620
place.
However,

199
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,790
the blockade,
well,

200
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,653
it's been a total failure.
First results position is not that 

201
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:00,400
strong.
Very few countries have supported us,

202
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,710
not even Kuwait or in mind.
Also,

203
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,830
Qatar has developed to better 
relationships with Turkey bands.

204
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,663
Even Iran console has simply proved that
they are strong enough to weather the 

205
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:10,774
storm.
And finally it's really important that 

206
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,204
we didn't make something clear.
There aren't plenty of gray areas in 

207
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:16,504
Qatar labor conditions that are more 
consistent with the ones of have a poor 

208
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,044
country,
the situation of women in the country 

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,490
and the lack of a democracy.
Furthermore,

210
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:25,324
the system needs to prove that it can 
work without the government because 

211
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,054
unlike dubai,
the lead has been taken by public 

212
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,720
initiative,
not private,

213
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,643
and this is one of the reasons why dubai
is still above khatami in pretty much 

214
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,450
all aspects,
but I am.

215
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:40,210
And it would it be fair to not 
acknowledge what they're doing right,

216
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,420
like they're saving capacity.
That productive investments,

217
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,710
um,
is there openness?

218
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,603
And While that's our opinion here at 
visual politic and now we would love to 

219
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,664
know what you think,
who do you think will win the battle of 

220
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,930
the countries in the persian gulf,
saudi,

221
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,120
or maybe Qatar?
