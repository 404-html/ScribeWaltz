1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,790
So everyone knows that Santa Claus lives
at the North Pole,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,683
more specifically,
he actually lives in these full bod 

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,263
archipelago,
which is the northern most human 

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:08,604
settlement in the world is the only 
place on earth where you don't need a 

5
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:21,460
visa to ends up.
However,

6
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:25,960
there are 2,600 inhabitants,
must be totally self sufficient and they

7
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:28,710
also have to carry a gun whenever they 
leave the main town.

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,530
This isn't a defending themselves from 
each other,

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,020
but rather to defend themselves from the
polar bears,

10
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:38,854
which tends to roam around the region.
Bones which belongs to the Kingdom of 

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,903
Norway,
is the hot spot of a political dispute 

12
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:45,940
with Russia.
Interestingly,

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,470
this frozen region has a pretty good 
chance of becoming the next Dubai,

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,190
although certainly not when it comes to 
the web,

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,080
Svalbard has one of the biggest oil beds
in the world.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,973
Further,
they are the gateway to the Arctic 

17
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,014
routes,
which might just become one of the most 

18
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,920
important pathways for international 
trade.

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,740
And this is why small bond is more than 
an ordinary territorial disputes.

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,140
We're talking about a potential new cold
war involving the United States,

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,063
Canada and even China,
and today that's the story we're going 

22
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:25,954
to tell you about

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,593
once.
Imagine alarms with open doors for 

24
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,470
immigrants,
no matter where they come from.

25
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,363
A place where a military presence is 
forbidden because it's a demilitarized 

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,053
zone.
A place which is a fiscal haven has the 

27
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:46,680
average salary of Norway.
Well,

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,940
this place that exists,
and it's called SFO boss Andy.

29
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,510
Yes,
it's at the North Pole.

30
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,430
Also,
if you want to go to svalbard bad,

31
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:55,920
there's no need to worry about catching 
a cold or the flu.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,873
The extremely cold temperatures make it 
impossible for viruses and bacteria to 

33
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:03,210
stay.
Didn't that cap?

34
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,100
It's a long year.
The and you can find the world's biggest

35
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:06,934
sneaker collection wants to try cognac 
from the 19th century or maybe a 

36
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,820
whiskey.
Well,

37
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,260
Colin's Burger pub is the place to go,
so let me introduce you to it's owner,

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,290
Steve Dorfman.

39
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,183
Many,
many different people from many 

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,440
different nations working with many 
different things.

41
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,293
First of all,
one of the biggest is absolutely the 

42
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,534
coal mining company take have been the 
coal mining company for 100 years 

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,783
actually,
and today there is more and more people 

44
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:40,480
working with the tourist business 
service like a restaurant,

45
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,440
but also there is a lot of science going
on on a small board,

46
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,463
so at the beginning of the 20th century 
that was a no man's land and only some 

47
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:53,320
whale fishing and with daggers at this 
place.

48
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,303
Nevertheless,
after the first world war and not all 

49
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,374
countries signed,
something called the small batch Tracy 

50
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,160
in treaty,
it is written,

51
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,740
the Norway hold sovereignty over the 
territory,

52
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,860
bounce them off some restrictions.
For one,

53
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,260
they consented,
met Rami.

54
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,133
They also can't build a headquarters 
already strongholds as they must allow 

55
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,583
every citizen and every company,
no matter where they are from to enter 

56
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,560
the island and exploited snapple 
resources,

57
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,970
and this is how to cities were born.
On the one hand,

58
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,840
we have long year billion where the 
majority of the population is Norwegian.

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,153
On the other hands,
there is Barrons Burg with a Russian 

60
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,700
majority.
In both of these cases,

61
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,950
these started as coal mining settlements

62
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,883
that every year there is a or two times 
a year there's like a sports contest 

63
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,810
between the settlements.
Between bars.

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,193
Yeah.

65
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,140
Tonight you might be wondering where 
executives of these mining companies pay

66
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,760
their taxes in Svalbard?
Well,

67
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,180
despite being a Norwegian territory this
fall about trees,

68
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:54,740
he forbids any country from taxing the 
profits.

69
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,723
This means that citizens pay the minimum
required amount to finance their own 

70
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,440
governance.
In other words,

71
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,433
fall could be considered a fiscal haven.
They have no VAT in their corporate tax 

72
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:08,050
goes up to 16 percent,
which is even lower than seeing a pause

73
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,663
the last 10,
15 years have been a lot of people 

74
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,250
coming from many different places.
Today.

75
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:20,780
There is like 46 different nations 
living in,

76
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,570
in settlement along all these different 
nations.

77
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:26,690
Live very good together with each other.
Um,

78
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,623
and Namibia we have every year there is 
a lawyer as a title on a celebrating 

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,170
there you have the Russian and you have 
the Swedish one,

80
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,040
but make no mistake.
All those tie,

81
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,874
Russian and Swedish people are not 
coming to a folder just for the low 

82
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,560
taxes or the coal mines,
as you might imagine,

83
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:45,394
getting cold from the North Pole to the 
rest of the world is pretty expensive 

84
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,580
and it's not a very profitable business.

85
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,473
Yes,

86
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,290
small barred coal mine halts production 
and so now you might be wondering,

87
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,124
well,
if Kohl's nonprofitable while there so 

88
00:04:57,661 --> 00:04:58,494
many people going back,
it's probably not for the balmy weather 

89
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:03,750
during winter.
Svalbard has a never ending night.

90
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,870
Weather is not even a single minute of 
daylight.

91
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,463
Of course,
several people who live that work in 

92
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,070
science research centers,
which are based on the archipelago.

93
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,023
Indeed,
since 2008 Svalbard has hosted the 

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,650
global seed vault.
This is a storage location,

95
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:20,484
people mainly by the bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation and Microsoft in this 

96
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:26,430
vault.
They restored a vast collection of seeds

97
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:27,264
from most of the plants that exist in 
the world in case of a nuclear 

98
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:30,714
holocaust.
Mankind would be able to reply on the 

99
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,140
planet,
thanks to this great volt,

100
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,040
but this is still not the reason why 
[inaudible] is so important.

101
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,810
In fact,
there is something more interesting than

102
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:42,540
cold polar bears,
science or even Santa Claus Sense.

103
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,000
The Arctic holds an estimated 13 percent
or $90,

104
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:51,834
billion barrels of the world's 
undiscovered conventional oil resources 

105
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,120
and 30 percent of its undiscovered 
conventional natural gas resources.

106
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,620
Ah,
yes,

107
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,020
they have oil.
That's not only that.

108
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,973
Let's imagine for a second that you want
to ship some goods from London to Tokyo 

109
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,143
today.
The fullest discreet would be to take 

110
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:09,944
this one,
but imagine you could instead do it 

111
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:20,361
using this room.
You see what's going on here.

112
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,963
This is almost half of the distance.
This means less spending and faster 

113
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:30,070
logistics technology and climate change 
are making it possible to travel through

114
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:30,904
the Arctic Ocean,
and this would be a turning point in 

115
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:37,420
international trade and one day this is 
going to be a reality,

116
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:38,254
and on this day,
Svalbard has the highest chance of 

117
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:41,740
becoming the architect capital.

118
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,310
The rest of the islands belonged to 
Russia and to have no human population.

119
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:49,890
Greenland's on the other hand,
has a chaotic legal system.

120
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,280
Svalbard has a strong political system 
and good infrastructure.

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,380
The proof is in this very interview with
Steve,

122
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,010
which was conducted through skype,
but do we just a moment because the best

123
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:00,270
pass,
it's yet to come.

124
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,250
The frozen war for the Arctic Arctic oil
is under the seat.

125
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,203
This means the above.
The ground lands of Svalbard has no oil 

126
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:14,440
beds,
at least that we know of.

127
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,160
All their wealth is on these so called 
continental shelf.

128
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,053
This is the underwater lands maps,
which extends from a continence no 

129
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,550
deeper than 200 meters.
According to international law,

130
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:25,384
the continental shelf belongs to the 
country that is attached to and of 

131
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,610
course this includes all of the 
resources beneath,

132
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,910
so it should be the government of the 
country who decides whether they want to

133
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,670
exploit this resource or what

134
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,583
not,

135
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,090
and yes,
both Norway and small bonds archipelagos

136
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:44,610
are on the same continental shelf.
Therefore in normal conditions,

137
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:47,580
the Norwegian government would have 
sovereignty over this oil.

138
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,170
But remember what we said about this 
fall.

139
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:52,980
Barge treating every country can exploit
the resources and Norway.

140
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:56,310
You can do nothing to stop them.
So what exactly is the problem here?

141
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,173
Well,
that's the treaty actually says nothing 

142
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,710
about the continental shelf or anything 
under the water at all,

143
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,603
at the end of the day when it was signed
and no one was really thinking about 

144
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,360
extracting oil from the bottom of the 
ocean,

145
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,390
and this is why news like this makes 
people so nervous.

146
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,860
Russia believes no way is violating the 
small bird treaty.

147
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,873
When the Norwegian government opens 
three blocks for oil drilling in the 

148
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,530
Barents Sea close to the Arctic Arctic 
Pelican.

149
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,013
In summary,
Russia says the continental shelf of 

150
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,273
small bald.
It shouldn't be ruled by the treaty and 

151
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:30,964
to be exploited by any country,
but nobody claims that since the legal 

152
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,830
texts didn't contain anything about 
this,

153
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,723
the oil and the rights to extract it 
belong to them and now we come to 

154
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,193
Russia.
I might still be thinking that this 

155
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,940
North Pole thing,
business more story.

156
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,893
One of the things for backup remix and 
diplomats to have discussions about 

157
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:54,970
while having dinner,
but the truth is that Vladimir Putin,

158
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,530
vice prime minister Dmitry ragas 
intimate,

159
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,610
a controversial visit to the 
archipelago.

160
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,880
It's the Cold War in the Arctic.
Russia says it's deputy prime minister.

161
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:07,330
Had every right to visit a Norwegian 
island near the North Pole,

162
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,470
despite travel restrictions imposed on 
him over the conflict in Ukraine,

163
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,950
Norway has condemned the trip and ask 
for an explanation.

164
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,513
This visit turns fall bald in we 
fashionable tourist destination about 

165
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,770
the Russians and the last two years it's
fall bumps.

166
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,740
Tourism has increased 100 percent.
Now,

167
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:29,770
as I mentioned at the beginning that all
to villages on the main islands.

168
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:31,810
One is Norwegian ends,
one is Russian,

169
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,673
the Russian one is gold Barron's bag and
there's a population of less than 500 

170
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:36,880
people.
Incredibly.

171
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:41,470
In 2015 alone,
they had more than 60,000 tourists.

172
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:42,031
Visited.
Designer.

173
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:42,864
Yeah.

174
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,230
Sorry.

175
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,523
Now you might be wondering why is the 
Russian tourism is so important to 

176
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,980
Svalbard?
Well,

177
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,320
that's because it helps to retain 
population,

178
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,350
but did it in.
In,

179
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:56,390
in Boris,
bu there are,

180
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,330
there are,
there are more on the,

181
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,323
like a system very heavy there where the
coal company is everything and you're 

182
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,780
eating in the content and it's not 
necessarily to buy your food so face.

183
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,440
So for a better understanding and the 
Russian sentiments,

184
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,640
there is no currency.
The mining company,

185
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:12,474
it takes care of everything,
something like this didn't used to 

186
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,373
happen in the Norwegian settlements to 
but then tourism staunton that brought 

187
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,170
all new kinds of businesses and as many 
different people.

188
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:23,130
So they are in the beginning of a 
process,

189
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,020
on the same way as we have been doing it
in longer beyond the last,

190
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,020
uh,
25,

191
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,883
30 years.
But do you watch out because here we're 

192
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:31,660
talking about oil and influence in 
what's my,

193
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,880
it's become one of the main ocean 
shipping routes in the world.

194
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,893
In fact,
even China is trying to buy property 

195
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,204
yet,
but that's a whole different issue and 

196
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:41,260
that's something we're going to talk 
about in a future video.

197
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,730
So we've given you our opinion here,
a visual politic,

198
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,380
and now we'd love to know yours.
What do you think of small bots?

199
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,440
Do you think it will become a new ones?
Are All the frozen Dubai?

200
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,280
Should No.
Wait,

201
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,800
let's Russia explain to this foul body 
oil.

202
