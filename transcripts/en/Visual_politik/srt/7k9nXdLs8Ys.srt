1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,430
Oh,
France,

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,240
the country where the far right wing as 
it is known today,

3
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:14,330
was born way before the financial 
crisis,

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,010
way before Donald Trump,
the game,

5
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:18,850
the presidents of the United States way 
before breakfast,

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:21,230
and the uprising of xenophobic parties 
in Europe.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,363
Way before all of that,
France have an extreme nationalist 

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,800
party,
the National Front,

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,110
and this had a real chance to winning on
the light.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,983
Sure.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,690
Julie,
in 2002,

12
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:35,524
the rest of the political players in the
country from the left to the sense of 

13
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:43,471
rice had to join forces just to keep it 
from becoming the president of France.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,680
In April,
2017 French people are going back to the

15
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,514
voting stations.
A lot of people think that this is the 

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,160
ultimate chance for the far right wing 
in France.

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,720
The moments where the national front 
with Marine Le Pen as its leader can get

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,360
the presidential office once and for 
all,

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,350
if this was the case of Marine Le Pen,
who by the way is the daughter of Marine

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,183
Le Pen,
has promise that she will do everything 

21
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:08,044
she can.
So you take a country out of the 

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,870
European Union,
but not only that,

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,890
France is the second largest country in 
continental Europe.

24
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,080
Victory for the extreme rights would be 
a triumph for all far right parties.

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,253
Consonants

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,253
do.
Just wait one minute because the 

27
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:30,000
question is really,
does Marine Le Pen have a real chance of

28
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:30,834
winning this election?
Is there anyone out there who could 

29
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:34,620
possibly stop her?
Today?

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,070
We are going to answer all of these 
questions and we're going to get to know

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,930
in depth history of the French extreme.
Write a story that includes wars,

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,950
ego clashes,

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,950
well playmates.
So let's get into it

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,610
and clap.
The French.

35
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,670
Extreme rights has to ideological 
grandparents,

36
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,060
adult pit.
My ends theo a s as you know,

37
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,940
during World War Two,
the Germans invaded the north of France,

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,410
the south,
the so called free zone,

39
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:09,920
who's capital was vishy,
was governed by French politicians being

40
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,380
supported at the German national 
socialism.

41
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,243
When the war ends in the new president 
general Charles de Gaulle executed the 

42
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,980
main officials from vishy.
But do wait one minute again,

43
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:19,814
because there were many people who 
supported this collaborationist 

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,080
government people even without having 
political power,

45
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:25,914
it held the same principles,
ends the same ideals as the national 

46
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:33,731
socialists for Nazi Germany.
Many of them were in the army up in 1961

47
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:39,900
the French.
So that's their most precious colony.

48
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,050
Algeria,
old,

49
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,830
a self determination referendum.
As you can imagine,

50
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,664
this was not great news for all of those
far right extremists inside the French 

51
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,740
army.
This is how the OAS was born.

52
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,693
The oes was a terrorist group.
His main goal was to ends the Algeria 

53
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,350
and attempt to the independence.

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,130
We are not terrorists.
Do you understand?

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,030
We have Patrick.
I would do what you used to the soldiers

56
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,000
who died fighting in Algeria and do the 
3 million French citizens.

57
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:04,840
What?
What was it there?

58
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,080
So did they succeed?
Well actually no.

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,080
In 1962,
Algeria became a sovereign state.

60
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,063
And then the OAS change their goals and 
trying to kill the French president 

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,230
himself.
They thought that the goal was a traitor

62
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,870
to France.
Fortunately though,

63
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,773
in 1965,
the French police dismantled the last 

64
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,414
cells of this group,
just like what happens after the end of 

65
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:24,934
World War II,
they jailing the hardliners didn't mean 

66
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:29,490
there were no people supporting the 
general court.

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,940
Awesome.

68
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,943
The country of liberty,
equality and fraternity has a large 

69
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:42,130
amounts of people who hated the Algerian
and to have for the Third Reich,

70
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,390
and this was the foundation that Joel 
Marine Le Pen used to bills.

71
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,690
Ten years later,
the National Front's,

72
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,210
so you only talk about the war over and 
over everyday we're reminded of what was

73
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,170
the war,
the persecution of the Jews,

74
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,020
the excessive behavior of the occupying 
forces.

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,660
And so on.
The beginning of this policy was no easy

76
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,100
thing.
During the 19 seventies,

77
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:09,700
the National Front's would never get 
more than five percent of the votes,

78
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,510
and Marie Le Pen himself suffered a 
terrorist attack at his own house.

79
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,403
Now,
this though is when the really good pot 

80
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:16,954
stocks in 1977,
that was the Le Pen family inherited 

81
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,840
from a fellow support and entire palace.

82
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,923
It was the palace.
Soon this would become the unofficial 

83
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,074
headquarters for the National Front,
or as we probably could just say the 

84
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,760
lappin family.
Yes.

85
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:40,761
My friends with this policy,
everything does stay in family drama,

86
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,253
reorganized all those electoral 
campaigns that need and the third 

87
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,830
biggest political force in France at the
end of the 1980,

88
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,903
while his daughter Marine Le Pen was 
following him and learning the secrets 

89
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,000
as the art of politics in order to 
become the leader that she is today.

90
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,250
Lisa,
his granddaughter,

91
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,140
Mary,
on the pen,

92
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,160
would follow him too,
and she is now an MD in French Polynesia

93
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,440
and a rising star in the national front.
Interestingly though,

94
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,330
even though his party congratulates in 
as the champion of family values,

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,360
Le Pen's family is far from a happy one.
Yes,

96
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,800
yes.
I didn't know here visual politic.

97
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,870
We really don't like to gossip about 
anyone,

98
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:17,704
but in this case,
it's kinds of absolutely necessary to 

99
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,850
understand the political life.

100
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,350
As I said in the 19 eighties zone Marine
Le Pen,

101
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,910
who we will now called Le Pen senior,
was on fire in every election.

102
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:36,040
He was getting more and more votes than 
the previous one.

103
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,903
It was during this time that he decided 
to hiring journalists to write his own 

104
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,194
biography,
and of course you know this random list 

105
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,313
palace,
so can you guess what this journalist 

106
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,631
did?
Well,

107
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:54,740
he probably can't unless you already 
know he seduced Le Pen's wife.

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,770
Oh,
but it's not just that these lovers then

109
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,200
runaway from the palace,
and then months later,

110
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:03,200
Mrs Levin was on the cover of French 
Playboy magazine,

111
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,090
and this is how the whole world 
discovered the more sensible side of the

112
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:08,924
experience

113
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,300
right

114
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,840
now.
This caused a split in the family.

115
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,450
No matter how good the father was 
dealing in the elections,

116
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,240
his daughter still agree with more and 
more distant from him,

117
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,270
but the real turning point in the law 
and family would come in the year 2002.

118
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,200
This was a year when France happened.
Presidential elections and for the first

119
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:38,350
time in history or Le Pen went to the 
second round.

120
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,511
Now,
as you might know,

121
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:44,840
the French Alex oral system has two 
routes.

122
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,030
When you're choosing presidents in the 
first rounds,

123
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,070
they can choose from all of the 
candidates,

124
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,933
however many that may be,
and in the second round you can only 

125
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,580
vote for the two most successful 
candidates in the first rounds,

126
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,443
well in 2002,
the ones who made it into the second 

127
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,184
round was Jacques Chirac from the Center
Right Wing Party and Lapan senior from 

128
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,490
the extreme

129
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,323
right

130
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,260
now you might be wondering how did it 
happen to do it too,

131
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,120
right wing candidate.
All the new rules in France.

132
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,983
Well,
during the easiest Le Pen learned an 

133
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:19,430
important lesson in politics.
The idea of the captain boats out.

134
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,533
I thought that this is going to find 
some principles of the party attractive 

135
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,960
no matter where they stand on the 
political spectrum,

136
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,420
but ben stood for protectionism,
French companies,

137
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:29,254
but also for French workers.
Do you remember the America first thing 

138
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,220
that trump was going on about?
Well,

139
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,054
it turns out that's not.
Trump's invention was used buying the 

140
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:36,784
pen in the 19 nineties,
so incidentals and into industrial 

141
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,150
cities,
like I'll say,

142
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:43,860
who used to be left wing strongholds 
voted for the national front.

143
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:48,861
Yes,
and this is why in that second rounds,

144
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,580
boozy remains loyal to the social 
democratic party,

145
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,350
had to swallow their pride and vote for 
Chirac and the center reits candidates,

146
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,020
I mean anything was better than the 
uprising of a racist,

147
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:01,854
extreme conservative.
Likely the Penn family learns a second 

148
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:11,304
important lesson in politics.
It is not only important to be accepted 

149
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:18,000
by your own voters,
you also can't be too scary to the other

150
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:20,270
people.
If your opposition are too frightened,

151
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,193
they might join forces to prevent you 
from getting into that presidential 

152
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,614
palace

153
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,933
versus Sean Murray versus Merry 
Christmas was not a great time for the 

154
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:33,980
family.
After 2000 and see,

155
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,370
Marine Le Pen started out internal 
campaign against a father.

156
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,433
Now if again,
Jo Marie Le Pen was a politician that 

157
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,310
ran for elections with statements like 
this

158
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,480
to

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,350
be an authority always,
and we believe that in a household,

160
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,140
the best one to have this authority is 
the mat.

161
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,050
Nonetheless,
Marine Le Pen was a women ready,

162
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,973
have authority and modernize a political
party that would honestly make windows 

163
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:02,220
95 looked like a piece of state and 
beyond software.

164
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,083
Now,
unlike the other marine supported gay 

165
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,350
civil unions and was against the death 
penalty,

166
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,010
even National Front voters could 
appreciate these changes and this is why

167
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,630
in 2011 or the pen Jr took her father's 
place as the party's leader,

168
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,610
but do not think that things were that 
easy.

169
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,000
I wonder what motivated marine and her 
deputy is in this offensive.

170
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,330
They have launched against me.
It's just that joint.

171
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,653
Just think about it when you've been the
founder and the leader of a French far 

172
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:30,344
right political party for 39 years,
it's not going to be easy taking orders 

173
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:34,700
from your daughter.

174
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,593
So even though today's y'all,
Marie Le Pen is the honorary president 

175
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:38,714
of the National Front,
he also votes as an independence at the 

176
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,680
European Parliament.
I campaigned not from a renal Le Pen,

177
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,683
but for Joan Marie Le Pen and I want 33 
percent and guess this main supporter 

178
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,860
inside of the family.
Surprise,

179
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:52,910
surprise.
Family business.

180
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,440
Again,
it says granddaughter,

181
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,260
married Le Pen who is starting her own 
battle against her arms.

182
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,090
Murray,
he's a provocateur,

183
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,360
an nt conformist.
And it isn't always nice to hear.

184
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,433
Meanwhile,
marines moderation in combination with 

185
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:08,714
the end of the crisis in France all 
working way better than the radical 

186
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:12,134
strategies have a fall back.
I consider Europe has made a mistake in 

187
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:18,724
the past.
They should've started cooperation and 

188
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:21,634
development relationships with Africa 
this way they would have fixed the 

189
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,980
people in their own countries.
In fact,

190
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:31,630
the latest holsters for this 2017 
election give her close to 25 percent of

191
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,860
the vote.
This makes sense.

192
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,120
The first or second biggest candidates,
and in an election with five candidates,

193
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,983
25 percent is a big thing.
It is always certain that she will make 

194
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:45,070
it into the second round,
but do consider that just because she is

195
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:45,904
less radical than her father.
This doesn't mean that marine is a 

196
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,630
moderate.
In fact,

197
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,523
far from it,

198
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,070
they missed 144 points of our electoral 
manifesto.

199
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,210
Lappin dreamier stands for closing 
frontiers of massive deportations,

200
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,350
the exit of the European Union,
the return of the French currency,

201
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,730
the same economic views as Vladimir 
Putin.

202
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,030
This is true,
but this is nothing new either.

203
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,180
All right,
so enough.

204
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,850
You're probably now wondering.
Well,

205
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:21,940
Cam lappin actually become the next 
president of France,

206
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,240
so let's address this question with 
another question.

207
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,730
Can Stop for years.
The center right wing in France,

208
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,710
Taliban,
good steal them,

209
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,593
but yes,
it is true that a big share of the 

210
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,520
National Front's votes come from the 
left wing,

211
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,533
but in a time of crisis,
family values and anti immigrant 

212
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,480
sentiments are particularly attractive 
to conservative voters.

213
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,670
So in 2016,
the big party of the center writes,

214
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,523
the Republicans chose a candidate.
We also put forward some of the 

215
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:56,670
proposals that made famous viceman was 
Francois.

216
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,133
So is the strategy working well?
Apparently not since finial became the 

217
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,050
party's candidates,
the Republicans have been falling on the

218
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:11,884
polls and they are now fighting for 
third position with the far right wing 

219
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:16,660
party of Luke Menand,
shore corruption,

220
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,494
sex scandals,
and the fact that people prefer the 

221
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:19,444
original to the copy.
This has caused failure and the center 

222
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,010
right to fall into it,

223
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,270
but there is still hope.
The battle is not over.

224
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:31,820
There is still a man who could be ready 
to stop.

225
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:32,654
Le Pen's hurricane.
His name is Emmanuel macron and he was 

226
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:37,760
the finance minister during the 
governments of Manwell vowels.

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,310
Alright,
so is Emmanuel macron a socialist?

228
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,820
Elmo macron is running in the elections 
as an independent,

229
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,833
even manual vowels himself.
Didn't support him in public until 

230
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:53,810
relatively recently.
So what does Emmanuel macron stand?

231
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,990
Basically he stands for the opposite of

232
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,393
Macron,
wants to ends the privileges and 

233
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,434
subsidies that French companies guess he
wants to end the barriers that made it 

234
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,120
impossible for the French youth to get a
job.

235
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,750
And of course he is against 
discrimination based on race or religion

236
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,643
when it comes to the economy.
He wants to be a champion for deficit 

237
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:20,600
reduction as fiscal responsibility.
Bam does.

238
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:21,434
If that was not enough,
one of his proposals is to forbid high 

239
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:24,614
ranking officials,
do employee their own family in salina 

240
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,563
be administration.
So as you can see is the antithesis of 

241
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:30,884
Marine Le Pen and surprise surprise,
the latest polls actually indicate that 

242
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,810
he is slightly more popular than Marine 
Le Pen.

243
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,783
We'd like the 25 percent of the expected
and all of this despite being an 

244
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:46,064
independence.
So he has a high chance of being the 

245
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,320
person that Le Pen will face in the 
second round,

246
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,013
maybe not because there is a last 
variable that we must consider and 

247
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,010
that's extension.
Even if macron has a lot of supporters,

248
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,640
they are simply not as motivated as 
those from the Japan side.

249
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,860
So for example,
if during the second rounds,

250
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,723
the National Front could retain 90 
percent of their boats and macron could 

251
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:15,204
only retain 40 or 50 percent,
he would have great difficulty winning 

252
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:18,890
the presence.

253
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,723
Yeah,

254
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,540
but I mean this is just our opinion and 
visual politic and we would love to hear

255
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,060
yours.
Do you think macron can be in the pen in

256
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:30,894
France?
Are there any other candidates that 

257
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,350
could make a surprise resurgence during 
the election?
