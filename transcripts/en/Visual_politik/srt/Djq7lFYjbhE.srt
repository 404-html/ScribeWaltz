1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,353
many of you have written to us asking 
for a video about what's going on in 

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:14,000
Turkey and believe me,
the situation there is quite dangerous.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,410
And in case you were wondering,
Nope,

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,020
this time Donald Trump is not to blame 
for this.

6
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:18,854
In fact,
the u s sanctions are just the tip of 

7
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:21,314
the iceberg here.
And this is an iceberg that could wreck 

8
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:23,974
many ships.
And so when we say ships we really mean 

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,540
European banks.
Just look at the map we're showing.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,453
Yep.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,050
Tuckey is a bridge between Europe and 
Asia.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,590
We're talking about a country with a 
population as big as Germany,

13
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:41,920
a country where Europe has been 
investing for decades,

14
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,000
companies,
factories,

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,210
and of course there are lots and lots of
loans.

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,500
One an example.
Well,

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,330
hey you are,
have you ever heard of bb?

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,930
Va is the second biggest bank in Spain?
Well,

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,760
Turkey is the third biggest market for 
this bank.

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,813
In other words,
when the Turks Sneeze and lots of 

21
00:00:57,341 --> 00:01:01,150
Europeans end up with a Kohl's,
I'm scared enough yet.

22
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,090
Well listen up.
Turkey isn't important.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,953
NATO member for America.
They have the biggest army in the 

24
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:11,464
alliance and they are one of the few 
countries with a Muslim majority and 

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,020
secular constitution,
at least for now.

26
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,600
Yep.
You heard that rice we said so far,

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,780
but the truth is that the Turkish 
president,

28
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,663
while he has not a big fan of secularism
or when there's something like the 

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,793
antiquing Skywalker of politics,
he started out as the good guy in the 

30
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:36,190
movie boss.
We all know that eventually it will fall

31
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,390
to the dark side.

32
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,983
In this case,
the dock side is a mix between a 

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,890
religious fanaticism.
Well,

34
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:51,070
good old populism.
I don't want likes to portray himself as

35
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:51,904
the defender of the average man.
Those tax that live in rural areas like 

36
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,923
Kanya.
I completely outside of the Glamor of 

37
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:58,294
his stumble,
the tax that they don't have amazing 

38
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:03,190
salaries and they maintain a traditional
lifestyle as well.

39
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,350
Who Do these people need to be protected
against?

40
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,213
Well,
of course that would be the western 

41
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:11,950
conspiracy that wants to end Turkey.
This explains why it,

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,590
because this is so important for to 
one's narrow

43
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,663
us impose sanctions and Turkish 
officials over the paint American 

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,310
pastor.
Nonetheless,

45
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,610
this is just the tip of the iceberg.
First of all,

46
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,444
the actual reason behind the US 
sanctions is not the pastor that's the 

47
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:34,960
military and sanctions with the Kurds in
Syria,

48
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,240
but that's another story for another 
video.

49
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,074
The truth is Turkey's crisis has been 
going on for three years already and 

50
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:43,600
this isn't just a political crisis.
In fact,

51
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,583
the biggest problem is economics.
We're talking about a small scale of 

52
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,010
Venezuela here,
right at the very gates of Europe.

53
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,950
But now the question is what is going on
in Turkey?

54
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:54,784
What happens in this country to cause 
them to fall to the dark side of 

55
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:01,780
economics and do we really have to be 
scattered today?

56
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,580
We're going to answer all of these 
questions,

57
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,590
but before we do,
as always,

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,140
let's take a look back at the huddle.

59
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,330
Strange Erdogan,

60
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,510
the savior,
so he is famous for Mary thinks,

61
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,373
seems Sophia Kebab sins inflation.
Since 1970 and until the year 2000 

62
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,380
Turkey had sky high inflation rates,
many years,

63
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,303
they even surpass the 100% mark.
This means that from one year to the 

64
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,010
next,
prices would double.

65
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,963
And what happens when you have so much 
inflation and you live so close to 

66
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,220
wealthy European countries?
Well,

67
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,054
you become a cheap labor.
Disneyland's companies like Renault of 

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,510
Persia builds lots of factories in 
Turkey.

69
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,630
But hold on a second because I can guess
when you're probably thinking right now,

70
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,250
you're probably thinking about,
okay Simon,

71
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,010
but isn't this actually good news for a 
country?

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,740
Well,
yes and no.

73
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,150
At the same time.
For example,

74
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,830
in the 1960s Renno opens a factory in 
Bursar,

75
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,750
a city in northern Turkey,
manufacturing cars in Bursar.

76
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,110
It was very cheap for rent.
I,

77
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,140
since the Turkish lira was devaluing 
year after year,

78
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,780
Renno had to pay the lower and lower 
salaries.

79
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,323
Okay?

80
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,973
Nonetheless,
when they got the money from selling 

81
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,624
those cars of the era,
rarely think they kept it inside Turkey 

82
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,860
of course,
and see they've Turkish money.

83
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:29,694
It was losing value so fast.
The smartest thing you could do with 

84
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,600
your money was take it out of the 
country as well,

85
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:34,434
fast as you possibly could.
This is why Turkey seemed doomed to 

86
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:41,860
stagnation.
That was until the year 2003 that's the,

87
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,320
uh,
[inaudible] came to power.

88
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,730
His main goal was to keep inflation 
below 10%.

89
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,190
It created a new car and see the Turkish
lira.

90
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,710
This was a currency far more stable than
the previous,

91
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,140
and as soon as inflation was enhance,
the Turkish economy is made a 180 degree

92
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,740
shift.
All of a sudden,

93
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,380
many European companies started 
investing in Turkey.

94
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,270
This included banks.
One of them,

95
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:20,110
the Spanish bbb we mentioned previously 
invested in this country,

96
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,250
big time.
In fact,

97
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:24,520
so much so that now Turkey is the third 
largest market.

98
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,383
So in the two thousands Turkey,
it was in fashion rule of law ans 

99
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,680
monetary stability.
Men,

100
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,900
the company has good reinvest in the 
country.

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,840
So if less than 10 years,
your average Turkish work,

102
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:39,841
it went from making 800 US dollars a 
month to making more than $1,200

103
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,370
it's a month.
Mother knew

104
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,410
that in those first oto in years and new
industries like tourism develops,

105
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,310
Turkey went from 13 million tourists to 
39 million.

106
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,610
And what Turkish companies?
Well,

107
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,543
have you ever heard of Turkish Airlines 
in the nineties Turkish Airlines was 

108
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,103
just another carrier,
but since they can now reinvest that 

109
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,344
profit,
they ended up becoming an aviation 

110
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,490
juggernauts.
Now,

111
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,040
believe me,
this is not an isolated case.

112
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,933
If there's one great example of the 
Turkish men are old and it has to be 

113
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,110
yelled as holdings.
This company,

114
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,944
it started out as a family owned bakery 
and now they've already bought European 

115
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:25,190
brands like godiva chocolates or united 
biscuits.

116
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,053
Today,
yielders holdings is the world's third 

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,860
biggest company in the entire food 
sector.

118
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,990
So in other words,
the Turkish economy,

119
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,853
it was absolutely on fire.
Zia Company who was on the line that 

120
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:42,544
would really seem to care that one had 
been to prison for being a part of a 

121
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,140
radical group.
At the end of the day,

122
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,220
the country was still democratic.
Another one was the Arab rock star.

123
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,143
He was the chosen one.
He was the one who was going to bring 

124
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,840
the Islamic wells.
That's the bright side.

125
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,640
Bags in Turkey wanted to be European.
They were just about to the Karma member

126
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:01,474
of the European Union as a fun fact in 
2003 they even won the eurovision song 

127
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:05,944
contest

128
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,270
last,
as you might know,

129
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:16,271
the negotiations to become a part of the
EU extended over a really long time.

130
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,020
So what happens?
Well,

131
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,660
over one lost his patients and he 
essentially said,

132
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,261
oh,
what?

133
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,120
So I'm not cool enough to join your 
club.

134
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,050
Well,
you know what?

135
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,530
I'm tired of being western.
I'm tired of a separation of powers.

136
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,870
I'm tired of secularism.
All of that.

137
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,750
It's now over.
Now is the time.

138
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,960
In the last five years,
things started to sour.

139
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:41,794
Third one first,
he was personally involved in many 

140
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:47,170
corruption cases,
but worst of all was news like this

141
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,440
Istanbul,
Ataturk airport attack,

142
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,860
41 dead and more than 230 hurt

143
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,813
Dasha tax of brought Islamic terrorism 
and insecurity to the streets of Turkey 

144
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,820
and the damage to the tourism industry.
It was a media in just two years.

145
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,673
Tourism income has fallen by 25% and 
this is especially worrying given the 

146
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:11,710
tourism accounts for 13% of the Turkish 
economy.

147
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,880
But that's not all foreign investment 
has fallen by half.

148
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,080
And I,
you might be wondering,

149
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,500
well why?
Well there are two reasons for this.

150
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,860
The first one is the lack of a chance 
that Turkey is going to become a part of

151
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:24,694
the European Union.
And the second one while I was out of 

152
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,633
one himself.
Yes [inaudible] Islamic radicalism is 

153
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:34,870
not just a danger politics wise.
It is also a danger for economics.

154
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,913
Ah,

155
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,930
he's earned a one calls,
interest rates the mother of all evil.

156
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,850
The lira slides

157
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,933
according to Ottawa,
the so called Economic Orthodoxy is a 

158
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,320
Western invention that will destabilize 
Turkey borrowing money with interesting.

159
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,273
It goes against Islam.
So he runs to the central bank and 

160
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:58,410
forced them to lower the interest rates 
and start printing money.

161
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,540
And what if the central bank and when he
refused and he said,

162
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,370
I just,
I just don't want to do that.

163
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,800
Well these are,
I don't want as well

164
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:07,950
central.
Yeah.

165
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,783
Thank can't take this independence and 
set aside the signals given by the 

166
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:14,910
president or to one speaking to 
Bloomberg.

167
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,013
So in other words,
after the failed coup to tar of 2016 oh 

168
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,520
one has finally fallen into the dark 
side,

169
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,623
he thinks he can manage the economy at 
his will and to every rational critic 

170
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,124
against his economic policy is seen as a
western conspiracy that he even named 

171
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:40,500
his son in law as the finance minister.
This new economic paradigm is not a free

172
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:43,920
markets or social democracy.
This is the new,

173
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,113
I don't want to nominate.

174
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,603
Do you mean

175
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,940
money to pay?
You feel spending wild,

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,330
you simply princess,
I'll Turkish companies complaining flood

177
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,640
the market with chief credit.
In less than two years,

178
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,474
Turkish banks have given more than $50 
billion worth of loans and all of this 

179
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,750
is with almost no interest.
The results,

180
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,853
well that's a crazy devaluation of the 
Turkish lira 2014 the exchange rate 

181
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:14,570
between the US dollar and the Turkish 
lira was about 2.5

182
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:17,510
Liros to the dollar at the time of the 
making of this video.

183
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:18,830
However,
the exchange rate,

184
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,990
is it more than six lyrice to the 
dollar?

185
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,770
This means that the Turkish lira has 
lost two thirds of its value compared to

186
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:25,604
four years ago.
It's also partially accounts for why 

187
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:31,400
inflation rates have risen so high to 
11.9%

188
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,360
in the end of 27

189
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,223
t

190
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,550
all right.
All right.

191
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,810
I don't want you to thinking I live in 
boy.

192
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:39,644
9% doesn't sound so bad.
I mean in Argentina they have three 

193
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,004
times that inflation is the truth is 
that you need some time between a 

194
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:48,440
devaluation and the rise in day to day 
prices.

195
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,620
So who were the first ones suffering the
effects of this deflation?

196
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,483
Well,
those would be the companies that had 

197
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:56,450
loans in foreign bank and there are more
than a few of them.

198
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,820
You really yielders holdings the food 
industry bm off.

199
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,320
Well,
here you go.

200
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,273
Check this out.
Turkish owner of Godiva chocolate to 

201
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:07,084
restructure,
six point $5 billion worth of debt 

202
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,323
estimation.
Say that foreign debt from salvage 

203
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,430
companies to surpass is $300 billion for
a lesser understanding.

204
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:16,264
This is the same amount of money spent 
in all of the bailouts of Greece and 

205
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,710
meanwhile the inflation rate is starting
to grow little by little this year,

206
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:24,544
2018 it's already reached 15% since all 
the nongovernmental estimation saying 

207
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:32,500
that at the beginning of 2019 it's going
to rise to 22%

208
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,923
yes,

209
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,143
Turkey's software and credit rating cut 
deeper into junk as s and p seized 

210
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:42,600
recession next year.
Add to this,

211
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,434
the sanctions imposed by Donald Trump.
We're going to talk about the reasons 

212
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:46,884
behind the sanctions in another video,
but here we want to focus on the 

213
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:51,480
economics because in the middle of all 
of this,

214
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:54,670
there is another player with a lot the 
loose and that's the European.

215
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:54,800
Yeah,

216
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,633
union.

217
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,223
Thanks like the Spanish Ppva and the 
fringe and BNP of paradise or the 

218
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,793
Italian unicredit.
As I've learned more than $190 billion 

219
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:08,514
to Turkish companies so far,
BBV has already lost half of the value 

220
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,193
of those investments,
so you can already imagine the big gap 

221
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,870
that a Turkish collapse would leave so 
far out.

222
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,560
Again has said that he won't ask for a 
bailouts from the International Monetary

223
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,230
Fund and he will not raise capital 
controls either.

224
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,500
But Kenny really stick to his words.
We just don't know here.

225
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,593
All we know is that both Qatar and China
have already promised to help for 

226
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:34,074
Turkish economy,
but it is still too soon to tell what's 

227
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:37,254
going to happen.
Yeah.

228
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,343
Yeah.

229
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,583
So now the question really goes to you.
Do you think Turkey will become the 

230
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:46,484
European Venezuela?
Could this localized crisis creates a 

231
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:52,250
bigger crisis all across Europe?
Could add one pull.

232
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,990
Everybody is the dark side.

233
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,320
