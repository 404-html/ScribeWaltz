1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,440
Let's don't today's video with a 
question.

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,460
Which country would you say is the US?
His biggest ally is a Canada.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,040
Maybe it's the UK as well.
What about Israel?

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,810
Now,
this is not an easy question.

5
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:19,644
Zones are,
and it definitely depends on who you 

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:21,874
asked.
Whether that is a country which has 

7
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,050
improved.
It's aligns with the U.

8
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:25,884
s a great deal over the last few years.
It has improved enough that it is for 

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,170
Republicans,
the best friend of the country,

10
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:34,740
its biggest ally more so than any other 
country.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,070
I know it's not Canada and the UK or 
Israel.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,993
It is Australia.
The country of Surf Kangaroos and the 

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,673
Sydney Opera House.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,810
Surprised.
Well you shouldn't be.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,840
Australia is Devi.
You are the only country in the world to

16
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,830
have fought with the US in all of them.
Big Wars,

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,280
World War One,
World War II,

18
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,150
Korea,
Vietnam,

19
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,230
the Gulf War,
Afghanistan,

20
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,960
Iraq,
and now we'll see the operations against

21
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,310
isis for the bends.
Again,

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,930
we could almost say that Australia is to
the USA.

23
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,970
What these score is to Imovie and at 
first might go unnoticed,

24
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:09,804
but remove that music and you can see 
that it's really something that's going 

25
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,360
to be missed on January the 28th,
2017,

26
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:17,194
and despite this old alliance,
Donald Trump decided to hang up the 

27
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:23,010
phone on Malcolm Turnbull,
Australia's prime minister,

28
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,700
not just that though before we told him 
to get lost and hung up on him at trump,

29
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,800
accused him of trying to export 
terrorists,

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,643
do the United States,
and this was all just about a slight 

31
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:34,350
disagreement that these two countries 
had over 1000,

32
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,620
250 refugees,
but that's the story that we're going to

33
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:39,330
get into another day.
Yes,

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,193
this brief diplomatic tussle might not 
seem like that much in the grand scheme 

35
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:46,020
of things,
but it has had a lot of consequences.

36
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,883
Many Australians are left wondering if 
it isn't time to start cooling off the 

37
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,390
relationship with the United States.
Spike just listen.

38
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,603
Well naturally.
This is something we started wondering 

39
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:01,334
as well.
It raises questions like how important 

40
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:07,040
is Australia for the United States and 
was it really sensible for trump to hang

41
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,400
up the phone on his greatest ally and 
all kinds of consequences?

42
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,960
Is this going to have for him?
Well,

43
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,990
let's take a look.
Shall we time for Asia,

44
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,630
probably not news to you,
especially if you've been following this

45
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,910
channel for a while else has changed 
ends.

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,230
Both the political and economic power 
centers are moving quickly to Asia,

47
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,011
like 20,
20.

48
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:30,844
It is expected that more than half of 
the world's economy and population will 

49
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:38,491
be located in this continence and China 
is emerging as a new superpower as well.

50
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:39,814
That's a fact.
I've been told now a map of the world 

51
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:42,970
has looked pretty close to

52
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,310
why

53
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,180
from now on,
we're going to see things looking closer

54
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:51,550
and closer to this.

55
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,920
Yes,
as you

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,350
can see,
Europe is leaving the center of the Weld

57
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,360
Indians taking up a position in the 
corner.

58
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,130
All right,
so that's a fun comparison,

59
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,730
but we come really denied that the 
world's changing.

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,300
What the hell is that?
It's where you've been living this whole

61
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,860
time,
the 20th century.

62
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,230
It's going to be Asia's century 
something.

63
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,860
We've discussed a bunch of visual 
politic that is my former US president,

64
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,694
Barack Obama decided to bet strongly on 
Asia and make this continent is top 

65
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,014
priority for American diplomacy.
It was under these circumstances that 

66
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:25,210
Australia became such a valuable 
friends,

67
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,140
but how close is this friendship between
the US and Australia?

68
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,660
Well,
let's have a place to look.

69
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,523
Okay.

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,240
Big Alliance,

71
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,413
November of 2011,
Barack Obama and Australia's prime 

72
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:42,444
minister at the time,
Julio Guillaune signing military 

73
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:45,084
agreements,
which meant a new era for military 

74
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:50,810
cooperation between these two countries.
We could always say that this new treaty

75
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,540
started a military friendship between 
the US and Australia.

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,880
In fact,
let's take a look at the description.

77
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:57,714
The New York Times wrote about this 
agreement agreement with Australia and 

78
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,494
mounts the first longterm expansion of 
the American military presence in the 

79
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,490
Pacific since the end of the Vietnam War
bus.

80
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,800
Well,
what did this agreements,

81
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,430
what did it really mean?
Well,

82
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:12,840
for starters,
thanks to the treaty,

83
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:17,580
the US can deploy a floating force of up
to 2,500 soldiers in Australia.

84
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,443
These treats are from the Marine Corps 
and they are able to quickly deploy it 

85
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,863
in the event of any conflict,
but don't think that this is the end of 

86
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,883
things.
Since the collaboration between these 

87
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:27,384
two countries has grown and grown,
it has grown enough to become an 

88
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:32,970
essential relationship for Washington.
It's not just the marines.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,833
The United States wants to make 
Australia the key home base for their 

90
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:39,020
activities in both the Pacific and 
Indian Ocean.

91
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,363
Now you're probably getting the idea the
US wants to have access to landing 

92
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,050
strips situated in the north of the 
country.

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,960
From here.
They want to be able to deploy B,

94
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,800
two and B,
52 bombers.

95
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,663
They also sent out a large naval base 
near path for their enormous fleet of 

96
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:59,130
nuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear 
sub

97
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,973
marines

98
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,203
and there's more.
The United States is also trying to 

99
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,844
locate and monitoring centers and 
missile launch warning facilities that 

100
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,850
to even once he rents parts of the Coco 
islands in the Indian Ocean,

101
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,810
which an Australian sovereignty.
So you might now be thinking,

102
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,644
what do you need?
Why would the United States wants to 

103
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,880
rent some random remote islands in the 
Indian Ocean?

104
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,800
Well,
the answer is actually pretty clear.

105
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,663
The US wants to locate to their long 
range surveillance aircrafts and armed 

106
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:34,150
drones on the Coco Islands.
They also wanted to use this archipelago

107
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,510
as another deployment center for that 
bombers in case of war,

108
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,880
but wait,
because there is still more,

109
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,743
the United States wants to improve the 
integration between their army and the 

110
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:48,010
Australian military so that the two 
forces could work together whenever need

111
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:48,670
it.
Now,

112
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,550
if you don't exactly understand what the
results of this could be,

113
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,190
well,
do consider this in the last few years,

114
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:58,270
Australia has carried out a significant 
renovation of them military equipment.

115
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,143
We're talking about purchase contracts 
worth billions and billions of dollars 

116
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,110
and among these there is quite a lot of 
American material.

117
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,330
Take the controversial f 35 as an 
example,

118
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,610
Australia has committed to buying 72 
units,

119
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,473
which is going to cost $19,000,000,000.
This is a serious amount of cash and 

120
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:17,064
it's.
We're talking about the country with a 

121
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,840
little more than 24 million inhabitants.
It's like per person.

122
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:22,250
It's really a lot of money.

123
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,563
Alright,
so now you've got to be wondering why 

124
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,770
Australia,
right?

125
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,733
Well that's for several reasons.
First because both countries are 

126
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,510
culturally similar and as we've said 
before,

127
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,344
they fought together and many times,
seconds it's because Australia's 

128
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:43,910
geographical position is almost perfect.
It's situated between the Indian and the

129
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,744
Pacific oceans and it is close enough to
the hot spots in Asia that the US could 

130
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:52,310
carry out attacks and deploy troops 
there quickly and last but not least,

131
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,150
there's another important factor.
Australia is an important energy,

132
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,390
raw material and food suppliers or 
Trynna,

133
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,340
so it depends again,
believes that in the event of a conflict

134
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:03,290
or tough tensions between the two 
countries,

135
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,380
it would be convenient to have control 
over Australia.

136
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,070
I'd say,
well,

137
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,903
what about the other side?
What do the Australians once they 

138
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:14,270
basically understand that the US can 
sort of be an insurance policy,

139
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,300
no way to ensure their own safety.
Some voices who disagree,

140
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,123
these voices,
they seem to be growing louder and 

141
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,053
further.
Trump hasn't helped with his whole 

142
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,914
hanging up the phone

143
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,883
thing.

144
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,450
That Chinese alternative

145
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,490
China.

146
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,850
It is by far the largest trade partner 
for Australia.

147
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,910
It is the first destination for 
Australia's exports.

148
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:44,744
It's the country of origin for many of 
the immigrants coming to Australia and 

149
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,403
besides that on more and more Chinese 
people who visit the country every year 

150
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,513
who have decided to study that anyway.
The Chinese mean a lot of money for the 

151
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,510
Australian and well that has its 
consequences.

152
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,113
A 2016 survey conducted by the Public 
Policy Group Lowy Institute asked 

153
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:08,360
respondents to identify the country that
was more important to Australia.

154
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,710
Forty three percent chose the United 
States and 43 percent China in 2014,

155
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,573
48 percent had answered the United 
States and only 37 percent had chosen 

156
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,850
China,
New York Times and look

157
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,783
under 45 year olds clearly have opted 
for China and almost half of the 

158
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:23,894
country's population believed their 
country should keep some distance from 

159
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,080
trump's America book eating and 
important Australian x prime minister,

160
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,880
for example,
is one of the personalities.

161
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:32,714
He thinks it would be best at trying to 
improve relations with China and less 

162
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:36,494
relations with the United States,
cooled down a bit and pay particular 

163
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,330
attention to how he explains his.

164
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,070
The Society of artists is a better 
society than the United States.

165
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,720
It's more even.
It's more fair.

166
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,650
We've had a 50 percent increase in real 
incomes in the last 20 years.

167
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,860
Media in America has had zero zero for 
now.

168
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,040
Australia has made some

169
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,320
kinds of gestures towards the Asian 
giants.

170
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,110
As an example of when spanaway 
Washington didn't like this at all,

171
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,470
the country decided to participate in 
the Asian infrastructure.

172
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,304
Investment Bank and institution led by 
China whose aim is to increase China's 

173
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,774
influence in the country.
The Australian government itself has 

174
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,534
made it clear that China is above all a 
source for opportunities for the 

175
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:17,290
country.
Luckily for trump though,

176
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,730
there are still many things that protect
his relationship with Australia,

177
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,390
American culture and the fear of the 
Chinese.

178
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,620
Australia.

179
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,453
I'm the US all politically,
culturally and economically similar 

180
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:37,040
countries.
They are so similar.

181
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:37,874
In fact,
it's an international level that it 

182
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:39,674
could be argued that Australia is 
nothing more than an extension of the 

183
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:43,004
American lifestyle in Asia,
and the truth is that a lot of 

184
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:47,240
Australians are pretty proud to be 
considered

185
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,073
that way.

186
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,973
Whatever happens,
I will not tell my affection for the 

187
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:55,380
American people and the best of American
culture that was not raised in America,

188
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,570
but I was raised in the American 
century.

189
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,630
I have not yet ready to say goodbye Lisa
prior.

190
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,643
Furthermore,
the United States is still the largest 

191
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:07,710
investor in Australia and investment.
If that exceeds $500,000,000,000.

192
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,643
Yes,

193
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,253
mostly the fact that China is still a 
dictatorship is making Australia 

194
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:13,644
suspicious.
Many simply don't trust Beijing's 

195
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,710
intentions.
In fact,

196
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,573
the government has stopped and many 
Chinese investments operations that 

197
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:20,664
intended to buy land in Australia,
so we can't say that it kind of all of 

198
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,830
indicates that the alliance with theu s 
will continue,

199
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:26,664
but the Australians,
while there are very practical people 

200
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:29,184
and they have made it clear that they 
don't want to be affected by a future 

201
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:35,280
hypothetical war of power between China 
and the United States.

202
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,731
It's like,
well,

203
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,280
that's what we think here at visual 
politic,

204
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,910
and now we'd love to know what you 
think.

205
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:41,370
Do you think the United States will 
despise trump,

206
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:42,204
uh,
carry out the projects they had planned 

207
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:43,974
to do in Australia?
Or do you think China will achieve more 

208
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,810
and more influence in the country?
Well,

209
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,683
most importantly,
how would you feel if trump hung up the 

210
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:53,370
phone on your country's leader?
