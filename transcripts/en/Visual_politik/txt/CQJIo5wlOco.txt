Speaker 1:          00:08          This is a great place to work. This is what Donald Trump said, well, referring to the White House in early March of 2018 hours before his chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn's resignation became public. This is Gary Cohen's last meeting. He's going to go out and make another couple of hundred dollars, million and

Speaker 2:          00:27          back

Speaker 1:          00:33          all the time. This phrase, would it have been specially, wouldn't have called anybody's attention after all the White House, and I don't think this will surprise anyone. It's one of the most sought after places to work in the world. Having a job in the president's team means power, influence and recognition. However way, just the moments because we are forgetting a very important detail and that detail would be who the president is and how he is. Now you know this well in the trump dictionary, the term usually has no place. It simply does not exist. Don't believe me. Well, listen up in the west wing

Speaker 1:          01:15          in January of 2017, the 23 most important people in the west wing of the White House were sworn in. That is the people who would make up the team that would lie or closest to the president, the chief of staff, press secretary, National Security Advisor, director of communications, etc. Etc. Etc. That is all of those people that we normally see next to the president's on tv shows and movies. Of coursE, dev you have president trump isn't president. Bartlet and surviving and his administration is becoming more difficult than setting up a business in nicolas maduro. Venezuela. Now, waiT a minute, maybe you don't know who president josiah bartlet is. Well, maybe I haven't seen the west wing. Well, if that's the case and you like politics, which you probably do, you're watching this channel. Don't waste another minute and go check out that show, but let's stay on track here. Let's get back to donald trump's white house.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Can you guess how many of those 23 people who formed the president's praetorian guard when his term began are still in office to date? Well, out of those 23, only nine are still in their post. Sam's. Many of those nine are on the chopping block. Okay, so you might be thinking, well, maybe he didn't choose the right. I mean anyone can make a mistake. Well, the problem is that that is not the case. A tall Katherine Dunn 10 per se, researcher at the brookings institute, one of the most important think tanks in Washington is following the changes that are taking place almost every week in the president's executive office and listen to it. If we take all the appointed positions into accounts and those you've been replaced, dismissed or resigned as well as the people who worked for them in total until now, 65 people have been passed of the president's office. That is a eight percenT turnoVer rate. That means that in just over a year, half of the people who were part of the team and no longer in office,

Speaker 3:          03:06          yes,

Speaker 1:          03:10          an unprecedented rotation race, the scandals, disagreements with the president or simply the oval office tenants, mood swings have led to working in the west wing becoming a high risk profession.

Speaker 1:          03:29          TO give you an idea, layoffs, resignations, and changes are happening at a speed three times greater than in the obama administration and two times greater than in reagan's suit. You still hold the record and we're really not inflating this by just talking about small posts. In the last year, trump has replaceD two press secretaries, two chiefs of staff to national security advisors, and five different people have been appointed as director of communications in this time, Donald Trump has even fired as lawyers and what's worse based on the available information, things seem to be heading in an even worse direction. For example, the national security advisor, general mcmaster hasn't just been fired since everything points to the fact that the general John Kelly has current chief of staff will follow in his footsteps. In a very short time, trump has decided to remove his national security advisor. Donald trump chooses them, and then he seems to change his mind really quickly. So with this scenario in mind, so we can understand why many of us team members, based on what they confessed, spends a great deal of time trying not to provoke a presidents who gets angry very, very easily. Now, many people would probably imagine trump walking the halls of the white house saying to people that you have five, but maybe this isn't actually that far from the truth. Yes, it does seem as if trump took his position on the apprentice to hot, where he basically fired people every week.

Speaker 4:          04:42          You're fired, you're fired, bradford, you're fired. Can I say it as a joke sometimes that derek, you're fired. You're fired. Eight matter yet, he Better otherwise. I'll say, tom, you're fired. You're fired.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Devastating. No business can handle this much less. The government, it's supposed to be about stability and continuity. That's just not in his lexicon. William m daily, former president barack obama's chief of staff, but all right, so you might be wondering, well, what's really going on here? Why are there so many changes? Well, there are many reasons. So on the fence and leave due to scandals such as the national security advisor, Michael Flynn or staff secretary, rob porter, who resigned after domestic abuse allegations

Speaker 5:          05:32          today, former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, appeared in federal court and pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his conversations with russia's ambassador during the transition last december.

Speaker 1:          05:42          Staff secretary rob porter, who announced his resignation yesterday and then domestic abuse allegations is now officially out.

Speaker 3:          05:54          This

Speaker 1:          05:54          was also bannon's case until August, 2017. He was donald trump's right hand man in his political career, but not even that saved him known for is highly nationalist position. Steve bannon was named senior counselor to the president and chief strategist of the white house swell. After a little over six months, trump sided to kick him out. In the end, bannon stepped forward and submitted a forced resignation. Others such as the economic advisor runs former goldman sachs executive gary cohn, or press secretary sean spicer, left. Because of that, disagreements with the president's many others. Well, they were directly fired. Ten days on the job that makes anthony scaramucci the shortest tenured communications director in the history of the white house. Trump's personal assistant, john mcentee, fired over security issue. Then there are other cases, for example, emma amanda goals here until December, 2017 was assistant to the president and director of communications for the office of public liaison. See, omarosa was basically known for participating in television. Reality shows, one of which was the apprentice where she met Donald Trump, and thanks to that, she became part of the president's team when he arrived at the white house.

Speaker 5:          06:58          I think I've won every reality tv a war. It's like reality star, the year reality villain. Best catfight, most dramatic momeNt. Most google moment. I mean, I was in a field that was driven by ratings and you know what drives ratings? conflict.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Well, in december of 2017, she suddenly resigned stating that had seen very strange things that had Made her feel very uncomfortable and had effected her emotionally. Omarosa was fired three times on the apprentice and this was the fourth time we let her go. And do you know what she did after resigning? Well, nothing less than joining the celebrity. Big brother show where she has been entering all that she saw as a white house employee,

Speaker 5:          07:41          haunted my tweet. And eVery single day like what is he going to tweak? You would be worried about pens and dream. I'm christian, I love jesus. But he thinks jesus tells him to say things like jesus. I say that.

Speaker 1:          08:00          So apparently Donald Trump has an amazing eye for recreating great job. Really? But okay. Okay. Now some of you might be thinking, well, yes simon. The thing with is west wing team has gotten a bit out of hand, sparse at the governmental level, things must be different, right? Well, it doesn't actually seem. So.

Speaker 2:          08:35          The cabiNet, the cabinet,

Speaker 1:          08:40          the body that is made up of the main positions of the us. Government's hasn't been saved from the trump earthquake either. See, in june of 2017, the first meeting was held with the entire cabinet. At that time, trump publicly stated that he had assembled an extraordinary group of talents to his government. Well, to say the least. Things have changed since then. There've been six cabinet rotations that's more than George Bush had in his two terms in office and it's more than half the diploma had in a single year of these exchanges incidentally for were redundant dismissals or resignations that have rains, priebus, tom price, david shulkin, the last time, the most surreal of that being rex tillerson, the secretary of state, and previously powerful ceo of exxon mobile, the largest oil company in the United States, rex tillerson, dvo you might remember, was fired through twitter. Trump didn't even tell them in person. In fact, it's ruined that skipping the president's orders, John Kelly, trump's chief of staff called tillison, who was touring africa to tell him that the president was going to kick him out and that he needed to return to Washington and consider resigning. It isn't clear whether telus and didn't want to, didn't believe him or didn't have the time, but the fact is the trump fired him on twitter.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Now, rumors about who trump is going to find next are growing like crazy. then carson, secretary of housing, ron zinke, secretary of the interior, Scott Pruitt to director of the environmental protection agency and the powerful Jeff sessions, the attorney general of the big favorites for the next firing. By the way, the last of the attorney general jeff sessions is being blamed by trump pinata having halted the investigations on the russian interference issue in the presidential elections that led him to the white house. Trump is fed up. He knoWs who the president is. He knows he's the boss. I mean, what are they thinking? How can the fbi or the justice department to try to investigate him? I mean, how dare they independence will have none of that. Thank you very much and pay attention here, dear viewer, because trump is a really forward thinking guy. That is why he is fired.

Speaker 1:          10:30          James comey or andrew macabe format fbI directors, and for that same reason he stated the Robert Mueller, the special counsel who's investigating russia's interference in the elections is next to be fired. This is something that even made a republican senator jeff flake from Arizona publicly warned the presidents without his possible dismissal. Yep. You heard that right? You are begging the president not to fire the special counsel. Don't create a constitutional crisis. Congress cannot preempt to such a firing or only constitutional remedy is after the fact through impeachment. No one Wants that outcome. Mr. President, please don't go there. Senator jeff flake wells, if you have. these are the reasons why working in the trump administration is becoming less and less attractive even for republicans. There isn't a huge appetite for many republicans on the outside to explore job opportunities in this administration. Ryan williams, former spokesmen for mitt romney, and by the way, have you noticed the main consequences of all of this?

Speaker 1:          11:25          I mean, who's going to want to work in this administration now? I mean, think about it. If you had a good job, if you had a good position, would you risk everything's going to work in the white house. I mean you could be fired tomorrow and that would be the ends of your reputation and your career and maybe you'd get fired by a tweet. And the reality is that for many people, they would just say no to working in the white house. And yes, the obvious consequence of this is that the trump administration might be lacking in talent anyways. If you are, this is how things are in Washington. And now consider that trump only been in the white house for a single year. But now it's your turn. Who do you think's next up to be fired in the white house swelled.
