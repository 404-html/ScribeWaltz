Speaker 1:          00:04          If you've been following visual politics for a long time, you already know that Argentina is in dire straits and they need to ask for loans from international investors. In these cases, the usual procedure is to print what we call a debt bonds. This is a piece of paper that says, if you give me this amount of money, I'll give it back to you in say 10 years with some interest far so good, but that's mentioned this situation. Let's say that you lend three thousands, Argentinian pesos to the Argentinian governments at the time. We're making this video, the summer of 2018, those 3000 pesos equal a hundred American dollars, but what would happen in the year 20, 28? Well, the thing is we just don't know, but the chances are the Argentinian currency will have been devalued more and more by then. Maybe 3000 pesos wouldn't even buy you a bag of Doritos.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:01          This is why international investors smart as they are, say to Argentina, wait a minute, dude. I mean, I will lend you the money, but you got to denominate that debt in dollars, man. American dollar is not your funky dollars this way. I give you $300 and you give me back $300 plus interest. Got It. My dear viewer, this is how an investor protects himself from would be devaluations, but hold on a second here because we're not just talking about Argentina. In fact, most the world's countries choose the greenback as the currency in which they issue that notes, and this is why you can read headlines like this in every financial newspaper, Mexican government will issue bonds denominated in US dollars to be repaid in 10 years. As you can imagine, we're not just talking about government set. For example, anytime Aramco, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company wants to sell their dinosaur juice to say India. They'll say something like, Whoa, hold on. What are these? I don't even know how much these coins are worth. Do you got to pay in dollars? My Man American dollars?

Speaker 3:          02:08          Because that is the currency I can trust. This explains why 60 percent of all foreign currency reserves around the world are held in dollars for one point six, $7,000,000,000,000 in circulation around the world. More than half of them are outside the United States. There is no international law that says that the dollar must be used as the global reference, but most people trust the dollar as the currency for international trade. And here comes the big question. What is this use for? I mean, how does America benefit from having their currency circulating all over the place? Well, it kind of depends. If you're a company or a regular citizen, this is completely irrelevant for you.

Speaker 1:          02:54          We could say it's actually worse, but if you are the American government's well having a good time. So why having a good time? I'll let me explain full of dollars. We told you a thousand times aerovision politic. The worst thing that can happen to a currency as hyperinflation. This means that all of a sudden prices go absolutely sky high, but how is hyperinflation created in the first place? Right?

Speaker 1:          03:28          No, the answer to this, in most cases, this is a 100 percent monetary phenomenon. If central banks printing money, like there's no tomorrow, the currency devalues, but why is this? What's the connection between printing money and losing the value of that money? You see, when we talk about currency, we have to consider it just like any other products. Yep. Yeah. That right. Currencies work under the same principles as oil or oranges or mobile phones, and that of course there's supply and demand. So for example, a Venezuelan bolivar has very little demand they need Venezuelans uses. So when the Central Bank of Venezuela print see ton of boulevard, this expands the supply of the currency and the price falls. This means that the currency devalues nonetheless, the demands for the American dollar. It doesn't stop growing. Everybody around the globe uses it for international trade. This means that the Federal Reserve has a huge margin to print money before risking any sort of evaluation. And you might be wondering, well, why would the Federal Reserve wants to print more

Speaker 2:          04:28          money?

Speaker 1:          04:35          All right, so let's have a look at an example. Imagine you've lent $100 to the American government and now you want them to pay you back. So you go to the American government and they're essentially tell you, sure man, I ain't got your money. How much is it? $100. No problem. Do you just go to that building? The one next door is a big federal reserve on the outside. Go in there and tell them to print you 100 bucks and now whip it out in just a second. No worries. This process is called monetizing debt and when you tell things like this to your smart ass friend, the one who thinks he's an expert in Geo politics, he will have no idea what you're talking about, but the truth is that this hegemonic currency is what allows America to issue more and more debt and do it more easily than any other country. And this is why it is so normal to find headlines.

Speaker 4:          05:26          Gas, the crisis is coming. Interest payments will hit a trillion dollars a year.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Having such a big debt is not really great news for American taxpayers. In this previous video we told you exactly why, but hold on a second because I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. You're probably thinking, well, isn't America as irresponsible with its monetary policy is Argentina or Venezuela? And the answer to that is, well, the absolutely not. You see all the central banks print new bills year after year. Not only do they print it, but they generate more money electronically as well. The difference is just on the proportions on this chart, you can see the increase of the monetary supply, what we call the end to indicator of the American Federal Reserve. As you can see, the number of dollars grows year after year. But what happens if we compare it with say the Argentinian peso? Well, she could see the difference and what happens when we compare it with the Venezuelan boulevard. Well, I need to comment here, and just nine years, Venezuela is multiplied them monetary supply by 100, but America, they've not even doubled.

Speaker 1:          06:35          Now for a bonus facts while making this chart, we decided not to include the year 2018 because otherwise the yellow part would just cover everything. This year the Central Bank of Venezuela is multiplied than monetary supply by for thousands, and this is why the American dollar is the most used currency on the planet and that's because it's stable. While other central banks print money like crazy, the Federal Reserve is actually pretty responsible and they might be wondering, well, what about other agencies like the Swiss franc or the British pounds? I mean, if there's one stable currency in the world, right? It's got to be the Swiss franc. Yeah. Well your rights in fact, pay attention to this part of the video because this is going to surprise you despite the importance. It is not the only reserve currency on the planet far from us. In fact. So check this out.

Speaker 3:          07:24          Multicurrency world. We said it at the beginning of this video. Sixty percent of the foreign currency reserves a hells in greenbacks, but well, what about the other 40 percent? The second most used currency in the world as a reserve currency is the euro which represents about 20 percent of global foreign currency reserves for that follows the Japanese yen and the sterling pound. But these are not the only currencies used as reserve currencies. Many central banks also hold Australian dollars brief and Swiss francs as reserves. But the question here is, if what you need for a currency to have a high demand is to be stable, why don't we use Swiss francs as much as we use?

Speaker 2:          08:11          And the

Speaker 1:          08:12          answer simply is because there are way less Swiss francs. Think about it. Switzerland has eight point 5 million inhabitants. The United States, they got 300 million. This means that the Swiss National Bank doesn't need to issue as many bills. The how I said that the world has one point six, $7,000,000,000,000 in it, while the Swiss franc doesn't even have a single tridion. This means that it's harder to find frank's than it is to find dollars to do a transaction on the other hands. America is the world's biggest market. This means that thousands of companies from all over the world sell their product set. So imagine you're an Australian company and you're selling mobile phones in New York. How do they pay you? Well, of course they'd be paying you with American dollars. So what do you then do with those green bags? Well, you've changed them to your local currency. So now he will have the American cash. Well, of course that would be the Australian Bank where you made the exchange. In other words, the more America trades with the worlds of the more dollars will circulate around the globe. This is a currency that is stable, abundant, and supported by the biggest economy decades ago. No other currency can be a match for the green back. But as you know, the wells is certainly changing. And at this point you can probably see where I'm going with this video. At the beginning of this video I asked you, is it possible that the dollar will lose their hedge money or at least be less important than it is today? And the answer to that, absolutely

Speaker 4:          09:42          us trumpets, America first. The rest of the world is moving on.

Speaker 1:          09:47          We've been telling you week after week here on visual politic that Donald trump wants to protect America from international trade. His first move was to cancel the free trade agreements with the EU and Asia. After this, he introduced terrorists to steal, so companies like Harley Davidson, uh, leaving the country, trump has also announced that he wants to end Nafta, which is the trade agreements between the US, Canada, and Mexico. In other words, trump's America wants to isolate itself from the international markets. So what does all this mean? Well, it means that these other countries will have less dollars and you've got to add other news like this ends of the met.

Speaker 4:          10:23          Central banks are starting to replace dollar reserves with the you are, or maybe there's other

Speaker 1:          10:31          plans, one bond sale with sanctions threat near him. It is true that the Chinese yuan used to be almost an unknown currency in the international markets. It was only used inside of China. Nonetheless, in recent years, some central banks are starting to buy it, but of course this doesn't mean that banks will start changing all of their dollars to this currency overnight. In fact, there are any things we don't know about the Chinese currency, things that your friends that smart ass probably won't know about either, but don't worry because in the following weeks we're going to be doing a continuation on this video, so please don't forget to subscribe to visual politic and click on the bell icon so you don't miss any posts.

Speaker 1:          11:12          Sneak wall here. We have some questions for you. Do you think the dollar can maintain its hedge money and the following decades, and if north, what are the currency do you think? Should substitute as maybe the yuan, maybe the euro, perhaps bitcoin.
