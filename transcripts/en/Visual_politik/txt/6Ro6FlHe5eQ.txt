Speaker 1:          00:07          Today we're going to talk about South Korea or as Kim Jong UN would call the Bad Korea. You've probably heard of this country because it's probably the way your mobile phone, your TV screen or possibly even your car with manufacturers or perhaps because it's the place where the most watched youtube video of all time came from lone star. Yes, South Korea is a big power, not only at the cultural level but also at an economic one. I'm sure every one of you watching this video haven't least one product from Samsung or lg arounds you South Korean companies on absolutely on fire, and this is a surprise given that in the 19 sixties, South Korea was an extremely poor country and no, we're not talking about relative poverty here. Other countries like Zimbabwe where actually more developed with this,

Speaker 2:          00:57          right?

Speaker 1:          01:01          The West in just one generation, South Koreans went from starvation to one of the most prosperous societies in the world and so now comes the big question. What exactly did South Korea do to become quite so rich and hold on a second because if you're a regular viewer, I probably know what you're thinking. You're thinking, oh, it's another video where visual politic tell me how marvelously wealthier country became because of free market capitalism, right? Rice, while I'm sorry to disappoint you, more, not as much of the story of South Korea is a bit different.

Speaker 2:          01:31          Fritz

Speaker 1:          01:35          compared with their neighbors to the north. South Korea is a free paradise, but their economic model has one peculiarity that sets it apart from the rest of the world. So then the question is what are the reasons that explained this incredible progress in South Korea, and more importantly, why was Gangnam style so controversial in South Korea? Both of these questions, I promise they are actually related and these are the questions that we're going to answer in today's video to the bottom. As you probably know, in 1953, the Korean peninsula was split into two halves after a war, which killed over 2 million people. At that moment, we could actually say that South Korea is the country that was actually in more trouble economically, the normal pads, all of the industries and companies, while the south was agricultural and under develop, had no desks and most of the children, golden majority of their nutrition from powdered milk that was given by theu , s and Europe. This is why in 1960, after many protests General Park Chung, he organized a coup d'etat and took power. This is how the first South Korean dictatorship started. During the following 27 years, the country had three different dictators. All of them came into power in a violent way by overthrowing the previous one. Nevertheless, despite the political instability in those times, the South Korean

Speaker 1:          03:02          a minute, because this economy is not as free as you might. In fact, a free market is organized in a bottom up fashion. The private businesses decide how, when and what they want to sell. Then the state comes in and regulates all of that activity through various laws. Well, puncturing east system was quite the opposite. This was a top down system is policy was to meet with the most important families in the country who controlled most of South Korea's industries. This group included the founders of Samsung and lg

Speaker 2:          03:31          Jean,

Speaker 1:          03:34          so essentially he put them in a room and said, look, from now on I will give you whatever you need to grow. If one year you kind of weigh your taxes, it's okay, I'll forgive you. Do you need some ground swell? But here you go. You can have it. You need to borrow some money from abroad. Well, the government is going to back your loan. Even if you can't pay your debts, the state is going to help you. Our country will be in jeopardy in order for a country not to fall. It must cultivate its own strength. Nonetheless. Unlike other countries like France, South Korea didn't put up any barriers to international trade. Actually since that very first moments and the government's guaranteed rule of law and low taxes for all businesses regardless of where they came from. That's not only that's Pacchiu. He gave all kinds of tax incentives for companies and individuals to invest and save money. In other words, the big conglomerates like xy or Latte gods to compete in an open markets with other corporate juggernauts from Japan or the United States, but at the same time they also help from the government in South Korea has no natural resources, but a big population. Those companies put a focus on industries that required a large workforce that's manufacturing and this. This was the beginning of

Speaker 1:          04:54          all nation. Imagine the life of one of the hundred thousand workers employed by Samsung in South Korea. He gets up in the morning in a house built by Cyt, the construction company run by the Samsung Group wanting his breakfast. He watches the latest visual politic video groups that we'd like to think on his Samsung Galaxy phone. Then he takes his Renno Samson car. Yep. You read that right? Rented cars are manufactured by Samsung in South Korea. And guess where as this car insurance? Yep. The all guessing. The friends here. He gets it from

Speaker 2:          05:22          Samsung

Speaker 1:          05:25          after a hard day working at. Yeah. Okay. You're getting the picture now. Now South Korea, man, he wants to go get some beers with his colleagues, so he goes to the Cantina. It's again, you're getting the picture. We can come and our friend wants to spend some quality time with his wife and children, so we decided to take them to a park. So do you think you'd go? Yep. He goes to some things very own Disney style theme park. In other words, if you work for Samsung, the company is everything. Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:54          We're

Speaker 1:          05:54          talking about the biggest cable and all of South Korea and now you might be wondering what exactly is the Chi ball tribals are big conglomerates supported by the state? Some of them like to already defunct. Diu were started by the administration itself. Others were born in the 1945.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Most of them started being family owned, but as they grew they became public companies and all of them have a number of different business lines and products. For example, LG is famous for that. Tvs and then mobile phones, but in South Korea they will all say the distributors of Coca Cola in total around 100 cables. Ams, they own the biggest asset in the South Korean economy. Now, as I said before, the government does place in red carpet tons of their feet, but this doesn't mean they have a blank check. This is why I went to Cabo as big as day. We went bankrupt. No one came to bail is a clear incentive for these companies to be on the edge of innovation. For instance, in 2008 Suny, the Japanese wanted to create the first, Oh, led tvs, but this technology there wasn't advanced enough and the screens were pretty expensive, even priced too high for most of the luxury markets. So the Sony guys, but the project on hold and they never really got back almost. Whereas South Korea and lg at the same technology now they have the same

Speaker 2:          07:14          problem

Speaker 1:          07:17          so well. What did they do? Well, they launched mobile phones with a much smaller display. This way. They took advantage of their assets and what is more important is they learned how to work with this new technology. This is why in a very short amount of time, they found ways to produce affordable own led TV screens. Spell hold on for just a minute because there's another more important parts which helps explain this very innovative culture.

Speaker 1:          07:44          South Korean education. We'll know it's South Korean children that have always had one of the best marks in the international piece of test. The whole country stops during university entrance exams in South Korean school suspends it, whatever they need to guarantee the best education for their boys and girls. Now, the flip side of this coin is that those kids have the biggest suicide rate in the world. In fact, all of South Korea has a problem with suicide. The country having these second highest suicide rate per capita in the world since the beginning. The government is understood. The cables would need high skilled workers.

Speaker 2:          08:17          Yes. Are they

Speaker 1:          08:21          designed an educational system that works in line with the nation's companies? This explains why South Korean children are incredibly good at math center of excellence, memorization, abilities. Further their respect for authority and hierarchy. It's always religious and this is why none of them want to start a company. The dream of every South Korean is the winds up working in one of these cables. If they work hard, they might even become a manager and to get a house in paradise on earth. That is a famous district of Seoul with a name that's going to sound pretty familiar to you. Yup. I'm talking about the Gangnam district.

Speaker 2:          08:55          Oh God.

Speaker 1:          09:02          The meaning of Gangnam style called human warm Gal during the day, a glossy one, someone who knows how to enjoy the freedom of a cup of coffee, but when the night comes down, her heart gets warmer because she has a goal with two faces. Hey, sexy lady, your big brother, Gangnam style. This is an extract from that famous song that became so popular back in 2012, even led to the main thing aside, getting into some trouble with the authorities and due to the lyrics, having inappropriate content for society that's obsessed with respect for authority. Something's aesthetics or something as radical as the hipaa movements from Elvis back in the 19 fifties, but the truth is that a hierarchical economy, one which relies on a few big corporations, is not a good recipe for a state of the economy. In fact, South Korea big as it is in the manufacturing industry, lags behind in other fields such as services or.

Speaker 2:          09:53          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:01          economy depends so much on governmental and Kabul decisions. There is almost no space for entrepreneurs. Think about it. I mean even if you wanted to start a company, it's pretty hard to compete with your competitors are supported by the government, but not only that, these hierarchical structures are not as efficient as you might think. In fact, most of the Chi balls have become bureaucratic bmo that require lots and lots of money to work. This phone leads the sales of mobile phones in the entire world. However, they make almost no profits and that was it

Speaker 2:          10:33          probably

Speaker 1:          10:38          right. Things are starting to change. A lot of self driven. Youngsters have been educated in Europe or America and now they are coming back to their country of origin with a new ends, more critical mindset, more entrepreneurial spirits. This generation is creating the rates for a startup ecosystem, but that is still a lot of work to be anyway, whether you like as an ot, we must admit that this top down model has been successful in South Korea lines of all of this. There are still some questions that must be onset. What would happened if a country like Samsung collapsed? What would happen to the country as a whole and not only that, but this marriage between politics and business has created lots of incentives for corruption on a massive scale, but that's something we're going to cover in a future video.

Speaker 1:          11:43          No, but the question is, do you think that this crossover between hierarchy and the free market could ever work in other countries, and what's your opinion about the South Korean system?
