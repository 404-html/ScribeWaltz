Speaker 1:          00:07          I want to start with a question. What would you do if you had $250,000,000,000,000? I'm sure there are many things you would do with that sort of money, but what if I told you those $250,000,000,000,000 worth from Zimbabwe? Well, that's a totally different question because in 2015 and 250 trillion, Zimbabwe and dollars were worth the equivalent of one us scholar. Yep. You heard that? Absolutely right. The truth is the Zimbabwe is like Venezuela, but on a massive scale,

Speaker 1:          00:40          this country has suffered the worst hyperinflation of all time. Since more or less than year, 2000 prices were rising higher and higher as an absolutely mind boggling rates. In 2008, a piece of bread was worth 10,000 Zimbabwean dollars and name. Are you wondering, well, how did it all of this happened? Now the answer, it's pretty simple. One day he told his finance minister, dude, I don't care how you do it, but man, we need money. And what did the finance minister today? Well, he just pressed the money printing button like there was no tomorrow, so in conclusion, Zimbabwe had to get rid of their own national currency and led to the economy be dominated by foreign currencies, especially the American dollar. All of this was a little while ago. So what exactly is going on in Zimbabwe now? Well, in recent days, and we're recording this in 2017, the country appeared on the news because of Acute Atar that spells the end of mcgarvey 37 year long dictatorship. And yes, my difference of visual politic, we must say that Cuda tiles are not what they used to be. This was what we could call the direct version of acute. It's, ah, just have a look at.

Speaker 2:          01:49          Yes,

Speaker 1:          01:54          bobby, to get $10,000,000 payoff and immunity for his family and this sort of thing better described as a soap opera. Regard it as 93 years old wanted to dominion power and he also wanted his wife who's 52 years old to inherit the presidency. You know, this sort of thing that can only happen in countries like Argentina and North Korea or perhaps the national front in France. So as you can imagine, a lot of people did not agree with this. So the IRB clans sent all of them and physical opponents out of the country. This is what happened in the beginning of November 2017 when they kicked out the vice presidents and this guy has a really difficult to pronounce his name. I looked it up. I still can't pronounce it properly, but his name is Emerson Minim, Guam. So yes, sorry if I butcher the pronunciation of his name in this one, the army's reaction to this was immediate and well, you probably know the rest of the story, but now the is about Zimbabwe's future of many is managua. The new mcgarvey is this man Abel to resurrect Zimbabwe's. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:52          Economy. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:57          we are going to answer those questions, but we do. Let's take a look back at the history. Thousand defect. Yes, you Zimbabwe's economy is a total disaster. I know what you're thinking. If you make a cocktail where you mix dictatorship and Africa, what you guess is corruption and policy, right?

Speaker 2:          03:19          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:23          kinds of right, but probably not as much as you might think. In fact, there was a time where Zimbabwe was known as the African Jew that that's also allowed this country to become was a whole continents bond and now you might be wondering, well, what happens when a country with so many natural resources, so many rich lands, so many gold mines. What caused it to become such a catastrophe? Well, we owned that. It definitely has a name and that name is Robert Magaldi. Zimbabwe has been an independent country for some 37 years. Thirty seven years is the amount of time that the Gabi has been empowered. The decolonial colonialization process of the so called itself Rhodesia British colony, and that in a 15 years old

Speaker 2:          03:57          for war

Speaker 1:          04:02          I'm hands, we had the white minority that made up just five percent of the population. Despite what you might think. They didn't have the support of western powers. They declared their independence unilaterally and therefore no other countries supported them. On the other hand, you have the guerrilla troops led by Robin [inaudible], the man who combined anti imperialist nationalism with a hardcore communist you. Back then, Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister and you might now be thinking cold war plastic communist leader plus longer. It sounds like a pretty explosive combination, right?

Speaker 2:          04:38          Well,

Speaker 1:          04:38          oh, absolutely wrong. Back then the UK, his priority was to let that former colonies become healthy democracies, and this is why I thought Joe has self signed, the peace agreements with the Zimbabwe and guerrilla fighters and organized elections in the country. These elections were as fast as they could be given that the country had just ended a civil war and had good real warriors all over the place. Who won the election? Well, of course it's rather than Garvey. So now you might be wondering, well, did macaby cheats in the selection or was it a fair victory? Well, the evidence actually suggests that yes, he had the support in. Yes, he did genuinely

Speaker 1:          05:15          see among the majority of the black population in Zimbabwe, there are two major ethnic groups who make up 80 percent of the population. And then you have the mat of billy who had just 10 percent rather than the Gabi belongs to the owner group. And this is why it's no surprise that he wants 60 percent of the votes. So in 1980, the UK granted independence to Rhodesia and this is how Zimbabwe became a sovereign country with new Gabi as the presidents during the first seven years, he basically grabbed all of the power and in terms of the economy, at least we've got to admit that things actually work. So

Speaker 2:          05:48          in the beginning they'll be

Speaker 1:          05:55          respected the property rights of the white population, both in a very Venezuelan fashion. He spends all of the savings from the colonial times where we have to admit that although it didn't work in the long run regarding, did achieve a greater goal and his role is in Bob way achieved the highest literacy rate in Africa. Ninety percent of Zimbabweans can read and write. So if you've got your dictatorial to do list in front of you, well what's the next thing on that? Well, that's to get rid of the opposition in this chapter of his life. He did not save a penny. He sends the fifth garrison of his army to North Korea so that he could learn about state of the art methods for oppression, and when those soldiers came back, he pretty much said to them, alright guys, now go get rid of these now to bally's wiped them out. This is how the [inaudible] started. Greco Hindi means in the language early rain, the cleans the straws by the inside before the spring rain comes. Yup. Shown as they are pretty poetic, despite the printed name. This was an ethnic cleansing that was done pretty much as the manual describes and the more than 20,000 people died,

Speaker 1:          07:02          and with this regarding gained a great deal of political stability. Forehead killed all of his political foes. That's in the year 2000 things. They really changed, not yet decided to start an agricultural revolution. And the style of Chairman Mao, it was a real revolution and everything changed for the West. Gabi decided that the best lands shouldn't be owned by the white minority. So we, he expropriated that land and gave it to surprise surprise his ministers and political allies. However, he only gave them the lines he could not give them the knowledge to, tends it, so production fell sharply while hyperinflation destroyed the rest of the industries. Since then, Zimbabwe has pretty much been a living hell. Time of the crocodiles, crocodiles wait beneath the water just showing their eyes and their nostrils until the victim appears. Then they open their doors and they eat them. This is why the new president of Zimbabwe, men, Angola, is known as the Crocodile Mountain. Galois was one of those leaders during the civil war and he has been a minister since 1980, so he spent all of his life waiting under the shadow of the dictator. That moment has finally come so far after this cue, his first steps, they've been very risky. Here is an example,

Speaker 1:          08:21          Bob Wade, leaders cabinet heavy on military ruling party, but this is not enough as in Bob Way and he still has a lot of work. It has been one of the biggest steps, has already been taken

Speaker 1:          08:33          government a bent in digitization law with the indigenization law is another economic policy made by Magog. In this case, he said bigger companies couldn't belong to white people. As you can imagine, the white minority that used to live in the country has already integrated. They used to be five percent of the population. They are now just one set, but now the crocodile wants foreign investments and rejecting because of his race, doesn't seem like a brilliant economic idea. Wait just a minute, because despite all of that, so the new president of Zimbabwe might not be the right man for the job. In a country like this, it's easy to find dark spots on a politician who served such a crazy dictator. And guess what crocodile did in the 19 eighties?

Speaker 2:          09:21          Yes.

Speaker 1:          09:21          He was the minister of national security. So he would have had something to do with that genocide that we mentioned earlier, and being the person who executed the genocide doesn't exactly make you a prime person to run a country. So the question is, that probably pops into your mind right now is really someone who can become a true opposition to this regime, and the answer is absolutely yes. In 2008, there was a political party called Movement for Democratic Change, and surprisingly they beat me in those elections. Yes, you totally had that. Right, and in a dictatorship like Zimbabwe, this meant a big time political crisis and we've all been simply couldn't destroy a political opponents. You had such political capital. On the other hand, he also couldn't let him win and finally regard, but he came up with a solution. He would remain the presidents, but he would let his opponents, Morgan Stanley, right? They come to the prime minister. Of course, this prime minister remained in power, but just four years, and during those four years, this Bob way started using the US dollar as an official currency after the collapse of that local one, but becomes free. It still remains in dire straits

Speaker 1:          10:32          ways. Unemployment rate at 90 percent. This is why it's finger. Ryan has lost a lot of political capital, so it does seem that in the next election the crocodile has all of the chances to win besides the army is also going to control the process and the army sports, the crocodile. One thing must be sad here and that is whoever leads this country next, we'll have a great advantage for it is impossible to do a worse job than their predecessors. So now the question becomes, do you think the crocodile will be able to take Zimbabwe back and make it an African jewel once again, or do you think he's going to turn into the next Mugabi?
