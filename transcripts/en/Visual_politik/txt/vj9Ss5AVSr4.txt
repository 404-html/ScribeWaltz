Speaker 1:          00:09          North Korea is perhaps the most emetic closed off and isolated country on the planet. I can you that now in 2018 it seems to be living in 1960

Speaker 2:          00:24          hello

Speaker 1:          00:27          the now this entire store, it might be about to change here and there's your politic. We've already talked about how capitalism is reaching North Korea by following popular markets. How can entire entrepreneurial revolution is taking place and how today, well then at 50% of North Koreans to make a living from the private economy. However, a couple of questions remains on the table. What does one of the most totalitarian governments on the planet think about this particular capitalist revolution? What are his plans and other very, very important question. Who the hell would be willing to invest in North Korea? Well, listen up.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:08          Views aren't the best of times.

Speaker 1:          01:12          On June the 12th 2018 historic in meeting was held in Singapore for the first time. TheU s presidents in this case, Donald Trump mess within North Korea. Why? Well, supposedly this was to d nuclearized North Korea.

Speaker 2:          01:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:35          The actual goal. Well in addition seem taking a couple of pictures. I mean, hey, pictures never hurts because the idea was to start a dialogue and cool down the enormous tension that had been growing between the two countries and for North Korea from continuing with a nuclear program that could have given it the ability to attack even the United States. Well hold on a minute because you know, one the things theory and another thing is truth. I mean, check out the latest news.

Speaker 2:          01:57          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:57          West spy agencies, North Korea is now working on new missile secretary of state. Mike Palm Peo acknowledged during Senate testimony that North Korea factories continue to produce facade material used in making nuclear weapons.

Speaker 1:          02:18          And nowadays as we told you, you hear on visual politic, it seems very difficult for the Pyongyang regime to agree at least in the short term, to get rid of its nuclear weapons, which are after all of that best life insurance. But of course that doesn't mean they won't accept to making concessions to normalize their relations with the rest of the welds and ends the international sanctions. Because you see since Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011 he said two priorities on the one hand develop a nuclear bomb and on the other something far less sinister reforming the economy. Yes, you heard that right. Although it seems hard to believe one of the objectives that Kim Jong own vet North Korean dictator has set himself is to change his country's bad economic situation by copying or some of the changes that have taken place in countries like China and Vietnam this out. Once they develop their nuclear capabilities Pyongyang's number one priority is precisely this to advance in economic development. Of course to achieve this they need to end international sanctions which are causing enormous damage. Yes, we'll see how that, it may seem hard to believe North Korea situation could get even worse. For example, between the sanctions and the sinking of Venezuela, one of the few countries that had aligned itself with North Korea relations. You have collapsed,

Speaker 1:          03:35          but of course when we talk about North Korea in the economy, we need to talk about China. 80% of all North Korean trade and foreign exchange occurs here and once that happened is that China has been pushing Pyongyang for years to get some reforms going once and for all. And since those changes have been slower than a total with rheumatism, well last year Beijing decided to start applying international sanctions. This is what was happening in August of 2017 China to implement UN sanctions on North Korea trying to band North Korean iron lead and coal imports as part of UN sanctions. As you can imagine, considering the enormous dependence that North Korea has on China, this has been a disaster. Just in the first six months of 2018 Chinese purchases of North Korean products have plummeted by more than 90% of Chinese exports to North Korea by 40% this of course is in the official market and as we've seen, there is a parallel market, the black market, and that's an entirely different story. The fact is that all this has led North Korea and industrial and mining production to go through its worst time in recent years as if we had the disastrous state of the country's infrastructure to all of this with our continuous black, less than a thousand kilometers of paved roads throughout the country and to get to crap. It trains that in many cases, don't go over 20 kilometers or 12 miles per hour. It's clear that this country urgently needs a 180 degree turn, and you know what's, they also know that in Pyongyang.

Speaker 4:          05:12          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:15          Ken, North Korea become the new Vietnam. In 1986 Vietnam launched the well known Dorothy Moye policy, a set of economic reforms similar to those of den Shao Ping and China. These had the mission of setting communism aside. In order to jumpstart a market economy to achieve this, agricultural cooperatives were dissolved. Price controls were eliminated, land ownership was allowed, and policies were put in place to attract foreign investment. So what was the result of all of this? While over the following 30 years, Vietnam economy grew at an average annual rate of almost 7% today, Vietnam is transforming at a break, neck speed and its exports are or any larger than those of countries like Brazil or Australia.

Speaker 2:          06:05          Well,

Speaker 1:          06:05          at the last into Korean summit in April between Kim Jong Un's the president of South Korea Moon Gin, the North Korean leader expressed an interest in following the model of Vietnam and following this line, the North Korean government has approved some significant measures in recent years, for example, and it has promoted the creation of private markets has given more autonomy to public companies. It does granted land parcels to peasants for private exploitation. However, despite all of this, there are two questions which we need to answer. He won't. Earth would be willing to invest in North Korea and what else is the Pyongyang government willing to do? I'll listen up. Would invest in North Korea. If you were asked which countries you would like to do business in, North Korea would probably be one of your last options. Investing in such a totalitarian comes from where the leader makes and unmixed laws. At will where the government Daggett's with brutality and dedicates itself to threatening the rest of the planet. Investing in a country where the rule of law and legal security is pure fantasy. I mean, come on while folks, the truth is they're not everyone sees it this way.

Speaker 2:          07:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:16          See some of South Korea is the largest company is such as high on dye lot cooperation and Samsung have already set up work groups to investigate and analyze the potential business opportunities in North Korea and according to polls, three quarters of South Korean companies would be willing to do business in North Korea if sanctions were lifted high on day, for example, is already preparing an early reopening of the industrial case on zone and industrial saying next to the border of South Korea. That was created in 2004 to how's foreign companies, mainly South Korea, which employs more than 80,000 North Koreans. But in 2013 given the growing tensions between the two careers, it was closed by the Pyongyang government. Even recently, Jim Rogers, one of the most important and well known investors of all time has lamented the fact that the United States doesn't allow him to invest in North Korea and just made statements such as these

Speaker 3:          08:07          Korea is now going to be the most exciting country in the world. Kim Jong Goon does not want war. Kim is not North Korean. He was educated in Switzerland. He knows there's a different world out there. They need everything electricity, so tablecloths, if you've got any kind of expertise, you're going to make a fortune. Jim Rogers,

Speaker 1:          08:25          but the holy Roman just amendment. The question we have to ask ourselves is, well, what the hell do they see in a country like North Korea? Well, fundamentally they see opportunities. North Korea has a very young, and it's very entrepreneurial population with low labor costs. In addition, the country, it seems to be quite rich and net for resources. It's got gold, zinc, copper, and rare earth elements. The estimate of value of all of these minerals could be more than $6 billion. As Jim Rogers says, the country is still being built. It needs everything. And if that wasn't enough. It's also located between two economic powers, China and South Korea. You see it the last Inter Korean summit, it's the South Korean president gave Kim Jong a pen drive that included lots of the investments that South Korea we'd be willing to. Yeah. Do you know what investments would be included on this 10 drive? Well sold. We'll be very interested in building trends, Korean railroads that in addition to boosting the North Korean economy would allow South Korea to export goods much more quickly to China. And it's the same story with roads, all pipelines, et cetera. These would be billion dollar plans. Of course not everything is so simple and enthusiasm is far from widespread. North Korea is a brutal dictatorship. Corruption is huge and the government can do literally whatever it wants. For example, it can expropriate.

Speaker 2:          09:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:56          is where the money is to be made. If you can figure out how to not get expropriated, Justin Hastings and associate professor at the University of Sydney,

Speaker 1:          10:04          and then of course there's the issue of international sanctions as a consequence of their nuclear program and until those are lifted any change, it's going to have a very short run. Now it's precisely at this point that China can play a very important role. You See, Xi Jinping has managed to do what China's been planning for years, getting Qian Yang going, which could obviously mean a lot of big business with Chinese companies. That's why we now see headlines like this.

Speaker 3:          10:29          China suggests sanctions relief for North Korea after trump Kim summit,

Speaker 1:          10:34          and not only that, China has allowed the black markets between both countries to flourish. It's accelerated the development plans in the border area and is already studying the eminence opening of special economic zones on the North Korean border and then there's tourism, which is one of Kim Jong Un's governments. Greatest priorities. Listen Up,

Speaker 2:          10:56          right?

Speaker 1:          10:56          Korea. A holiday spot was the arrival of Chinese tourists has continued in recent years and since May, 2018 the number of daily arrivals is more than doubled.

Speaker 3:          11:07          You're going to run at least seven or eight tour routes to North Korea this year, including a one day tour to nano and a trip of four to five days to Pyongyang. K Song and Pawn Joan changing it. Deputy manager of a Chinese travel company.

Speaker 1:          11:22          Well, tourism is precisely one of the Pyongyang government's top priorities for several reasons. First, it generates employment. Remember, this is a very labor intensive Saxa. It also attracts investments that helps obtain foreign currency very quick.

Speaker 2:          11:35          Okay. On the other

Speaker 1:          11:40          hand, tourism could change the regimes image and the truth is that swapping nuclear parades and nuclear threats with exotic beaches and seaside dinners, it's going to be good for business. Do you do this? In 2014 the Korean government created these special tourist of one son, a special economic zone where foreign investment is allowed and where in principle the regime would allow more freedom for developing tourism. Yes, this is the same area where until recently the army did things like this. You know, North Korea and things is that with the nuclear program and the sanctions results have been very scarce. However, Kim Jong Un, he wants to step on the gas without going any further. In 2017 the North Korean governments and to delegation to Spain, which is one of the major tourist powers of the world in order to check out places and like panadol more marina d'or. The idea was that this delegation would learn from them and get some ideas.

Speaker 1:          12:43          Apparently Pyongyang's goal is to attract more than 1 million tourists per year in the short term and five to 10 million more in the foreseeable future. The question is, will Kim Jong really be willing to carry out all of the reforms that the country needs to get these plans to come to life? Well, folks, only the future going to be able to answer that question for now. What seems clear is that we have the best opportunity to leave the North Korean nightmare behind, which isn't only a threat to the rest of the world's best. Above all, it's a punishments and to great prison of fear and repression for the North Koreans themselves. But now it's your turn. Are you in favor of lifting sanctions against North Korea?
