Speaker 1:          00:07          Unless you are watching this video from Syria, it's fair to say that no matter how bad the situation in your country, Venezuela is doing worse, as of 2015, they are experiencing more inflation than any other country in the entire world. Furthermore, their capital Caracas is currently ranked as being the world's most violent city, beating out other famously violent cities in both Mexico and it's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Columbia,

Speaker 1:          00:37          something as simple as buying toilet paper has also become a practically impossible in Venezuela and scarcity has become a norm in supermarkets. Other products such as condoms have to be bought and sold on the black market, and all of this is happening in a country with the world's largest oil reserves. In fact, it wasn't so long ago, the Venezuela was the richest country in the whole of South America, but today, over half the population lives in poverty. So the big question is how did they ends up there? How did the government destroy the economy in such a short amount of time? Today we're going to tell you that story.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Well, the variant revolution, the first character in our story is Hugo Chavez. The father of modern day Venezuela, or should we say the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. He became presidents after a landslide victory in 1999. His campaign was based on the promise of equality and poverty reduction, a policy that he called 21st century socialism. One of his first policies was called the system for the democratization of jobs. This was meant to be implemented in the PD Vsa, the stage company that extracts Venezuela's oil, and don't forget now that we're talking about a country that has a bigger oil reserves than Saudi Arabia.

Speaker 2:          01:55          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:01          vsas payroll has more than doubled to a hundred and 15,000 employees. See, Chavez took office in 1999 and that has recent them since 2006 to 34 billion US dollars.

Speaker 1:          02:14          This was pretty big news considering the VSA is the largest company in South America. Nevertheless, Venezuela kept producing the same number of barrels per year. This means that the staff increase had nothing to do with corporate reasons, but rather political ones. In fact, this job or democratization, it was a way to employ all of the unemployed Venezuelans. The same thing happens in the government during the Chavez administration, public spending,

Speaker 2:          02:44          this

Speaker 1:          02:44          men's, more government workers and more social programs have an ever before. However, none of this was a problem. As long as the oil exports kept paying the bills. In fact, Chavez cut poverty in half despite being an oil rich country. Before Chavez. Sixty percent of the population lived in poverty. Ten years after Chavez, only 30 percent did display ship as his rhetoric that capitalist countries were trying to destroy the revolution, no one would reject Venezuela's oil. Even Nicolas Sarcozi, Francis Conservative presidents over the volume was complimenting Venezuela's

Speaker 1:          03:20          level. It's with their strong turnout. The shows, once again, the vitality of democracy in Venezuela. So all of these policies we must add the famous know I've got this literally means expropriate. This expropriation being the taking away of private property from its owner. Chavez was no fan of private businesses and it was not uncommon for him to visit a city and go around declaring that various businesses being nationalized. This would include all sorts of businesses, including things like small shops. All of this ended up with Venezuela having an economy if it was fully dependent on its oil buying 2012 brands barrels when 95 percent of Venezuela's exports. We should also note here that PD and higher costs than any other oil company, and this was largely because of the staff increases. Nonetheless, as long as the oil price remains high enough to cover the production costs, it's Venezuela kept making oil and everyone was happy. Well, just hold on a minute because this is where things turn sour. In 2014 oil prices fell in Venezuela was the first country to feel the effects of this. For their profit per barrel shrank and more and more every single day.

Speaker 2:          04:35          The

Speaker 1:          04:35          last now by that time the oil crisis started. Hugo Chavez had already passed away and his successor was a guy named Nicolas Maduro. I always look at me funny. Then flew over my head and I could feel the spirit of Chavez in the field. No, this is not a joke, nor is it a quote taken out of context. Maduro found himself the head of the country that wasn't making enough money from. It's only export and Maduro had wages to pay. Then on top of all this, we have the famous now because of all that expropriating that was going on, we've been left with a Venezuela that has no private companies, so even if he decided to raise taxes, there's no one left the pavement, and this is when Missouri made the most irresponsible decision that any political leader can make. He decided to print money having devalued the Venezuelan currency, the believer inflation skyrocketed. Here's an example of how bad this was. Imagine you're sitting in a bar and crackers in July of 2016, met emily called steel around 50 bullet boss. Then you go back to the same bar in Caracas in September, and that same beer would cost you $100 boulevards. This has been happening in Venezuela consistently for the last three years.

Speaker 1:          06:01          This had the effect of destroying all of the poverty reduction measures that Chavez had implemented. Oh, and believe me, it gets worse from here. Just when things were looking really terrible, but decided to demonstrate just how much worse they can get. Youtube to finish with the price increases will be the creation of the maximum sales brides. Neil Matsumoto. According to Missouri, the hyperinflation was caused by those evil capitalists. He wanted to destroy Venezuela. So the logical solution of course was the fight them. So you're probably wondering right now what exactly the outcome of all of this is. Well, this time, let's imagine that you own butcher shop in the beautiful city of Maricado. You believe meat from a Colombian farmer and you pay with US dollars. For example, let's say the pounds of beef costs you $10 for Venezuelan central bank has an official exchange rate of 10 boulevard store one US dollar, but no one's going to sell you dollars at that price because the market price is way higher. This means that if he wants to buy beef from your Colombian producer, you're going to have to pay the price set by the market. This is the equivalent of 10,000 Bolivares per 10,

Speaker 2:          07:15          right?

Speaker 1:          07:17          It's fine, but then you go back to your shop and you want to sell this pounds of beef that you bought, but then he find out that the government has set a maximum sale price of a thousand boulevards, which is 10 times less than what you paid, so now you've got two options. You can close up your shop or to sell your meat on the black market. Now some of you might be wondering, why do they have to buy foreign name? Why can't they just buy meat that was made inside Venezuela? The answer is that whatever product you buy it, it's going to require something that is made outside of the country that you bought the product in. For example, if you want to grow weeds, you're going to need a tractor which is manufactured somewhere else and you might find that even the seeds or the fertilizer also need in a different country one way or another. There is no country on earth that is capable of producing all that they consume, not even the United States. Oh, and don't forget now that Venezuela based their entire economy on the export of oil, and so dave still, that's not going so well. Venezuelan oil has become so expensive that they'd rather buy it from external sources than even use their own

Speaker 1:          08:23          be. The BSA has lounge, one of it's largest oil tenders ever seeking to buy some 8 million barrels of us or Nigerian light crude for delivery from April through June. As I mentioned previously, Venezuelan oil is really expensive to produce and it turns out that they've just rolled the blind from other countries that use their own oil. Meanwhile, shops cannot import goods. This is leading to a scarcity of toilet paper and there's even lead to situations where people have stabbed each other over a small piece of.

Speaker 2:          08:53          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:59          so now that we've given you the rundown on Venezuela, we'd love to know what you think. Do you think Madeira, we'll be able to pull this country out of collapse.
