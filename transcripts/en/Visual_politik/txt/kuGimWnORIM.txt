Speaker 1:          00:07          I'm going to stop this episode with a question and please don't treat him. Please don't Google the answer. What is the country with the biggest chance of female politicians insight it's parliaments. It might be thinking right now, Norway, Sweden, maybe Great Britain. Well, if that's the case, your thinking is wrong because the answer, it's actually Rwanda, one of the poorest places in Subsaharan Africa.

Speaker 1:          00:32          I'm sure many of you already know this country, yet least those of you who are as old as me, because in the end of 1994, the Rwandan genocide, it appears on every news station around the world. It was one of the biggest atrocities in mankind's history in just 100 days. There are ones in governments brutally killed almost a million people. This meant that every one in five Rwandans was murdered for decades. Rwanda. It was the synonym for humanitarian catastrophe, starvation, and it was a memory of the darkest side of the human condition. Nonetheless, 23 years later in the year, 2017, Rwanda is turning into something much difference

Speaker 1:          01:11          is from Rwanda investing in one of the world's fastest growing economies. Yep. You heard that rides, Rwanda is becoming a hot topic in the financial world, a country that used to appear on humanitarian aid commercials. Now he's starting to fill financial newspapers and it's President Paul Kagame has become the new African rockstar being received a prestigious places like Harvard or the Brookings Institution. Yes, of course. Everyone does agree that it style is kind of areas and winning elections with over 96 percent of the vote doesn't exactly sound democratic, does it? I mean, despite all of that, you can judge a man that he's taking Rwanda out of poverty. The figures speak for themselves since Paul Kagame came into power Rwandans to triple their income and the percentage of the population that lives in extreme poverty is reducing gear. Now, the question is, how did Rwanda end up like this? Or perhaps maybe this is too good to be true. I just the some detail we're missing here today. Well, we are going to answer those questions before we do. As usual. Let's take a look back at the history. I'm. Trust me, this one is pretty intense.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Fabricated hatred. Remember this date, April the sixth, 19, 94 on this date, the plane the Rwandan president was flying in was hit spine anti aircraft gun

Speaker 2:          02:36          I

Speaker 1:          02:36          the notes who organized this attack, but the ones an army soldiers belong to the Hutu trolley, blames that rival the Tutsis. Tutsis were a minority inside ruins. They're living in an apartheid situation. Local media referred to them as cockroaches, and many of them had already escaped to refugee camps in neighboring countries, but no one could have predicted that the mounting prejudice would have unleashed such carnage

Speaker 3:          03:26          bottle.

Speaker 1:          03:36          What messages like this with broadcast on the radio, there are one's an army was passing out clubs and machetes to civilians. If any of those who to civilians showed mercy to his or her tootsie neighbors, he or she would risk being executed as a collaborator. Explains why many Rwandans clubs there, tootsie wives to death, and 20. Even some Catholic churches became human slaughterhouses in just 100 days. Nearly a million people died by their neighbors. Machete. Well, now you might be wondering why did the Hutus hate the Tutsi so much with a really that different and while the answer is you expect is, nope, you see many African countries have lots of different cultures and races living together. South Africa, for example, has nine official languages. Your guns or it's over $50. Nonetheless, Rwanda and territory with surprisingly homogenous for centuries, one single language on a single culture, the Hutus and Tutsis and other tribes, they lived in relative harmony in the 20th century, Belgium colonized this country, one of the first policies made by the Belgian government was to force the locals to label themselves according to the tribe they belonged to. This way, it would be easier for the colonizers to identify who was who,

Speaker 1:          05:07          and during the first years the Tutsis were the tribe in charge of government institutions created by the Belgians. Then one's eight, those Tutsis started asking for independent, and that's when Belgian started supporting the Hutus with racist propaganda. This is how when Rwanda became a sovereign state in 1962, Hutus and Tutsis had already become fierce enemies. That hatred, it was fabricated by the colonizers and many Tutsis had to flee to refugee camps in neighboring countries. Among them was the man that you see on the screen now, pull Kagomi, now remember his name, because it will be the key figure in this story. We'll look at Goldman. He was raised on one of those aforementioned refugee camps. This one, it was situated in Uganda. It was the beginning of the 19 eighties back then Uganda. Ganzer was in the middle of a civil war and Kagomi along with other Rwandan refugees for to the Ugandan government and they want, and this is how to army as a military. Legend was born in the 19 nineties. He would lead other attacks against the Hutu lead Rwandan government's, but the turning points was in 1990 for 100 days after that horrific massacre. On April the sixth,

Speaker 1:          06:23          Tacoma was making his entrance in Kigali, the Rwandan carbon with 2,500 soldiers. The genocide was over and Rwanda, it had a new government. This time it was a Tutsi lead. Governments with Kagomi serving as the vice presidents, but hold on just a second because the story, it doesn't just end here because imagine the scenario for one, he had to help lead a divided country where genocide survivors how to live next to the neighbors that had killed their friends

Speaker 2:          06:48          family.

Speaker 1:          06:52          I didn't tell that Rwanda was one of the 10 poorest countries on earth with few resources to export, and on top of all of that, this brand new tootsie government was not an example of transparency and respect for human rights. As you can imagine, many of the soldiers who had taken over Kigali, they wanted revenge and well during the next year, no one made an effort to stop the executions and the unfair trials. If this wasn't enough, many ministers trying to use their positions to fill their pockets with the little money that Rwanda hat corruption certainly on the rise. Meanwhile for Kagomi had the charisma, the popular support, and especially the political ambition to rise even higher. And this is why in March of 2000, let Hootsuite, president resilience man's without an election. Well, the inevitable happens gamay the eternal president in the year 2000 army became the new Rwandan presidents until you came to Palo with two clear goals. The first one was to unify the Rwandan people after the genocide. The second was to pull this country out of poverty. So what did he do to achieve this goal? Well, he traveled. You're going to be created an advisory team that went to countries like China, Thailand, and Singapore. So can you guess what? Those three places, what do they have in common? Well, the answer is that they were countries that used to be poor. Back then they were emerging nations.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Kagomi arranged meetings with politicians. Economists send civil sevens, and from these meetings he wrote down at scores of ideas in a notebook. Then he returns with the golden formula to build a wealthy country. This notebook became the foundation for the brand new Rwandan constitution, and more importantly, vision 20 slash 20, basically vision 20 slash 20 was it government development plan launched by Paul Kagame, gummy with the goal of transforming wander into a middle income country in just two days.

Speaker 2:          08:47          Modern,

Speaker 1:          08:47          peaceful country for extreme poverty no longer existed, but wait just a minute because this isn't the normal buzzword filled speech of a politician Rwanda's vision 20 slash 20. It had 44. Clear and accountable goals, for instance, except that by the year 20, 21 in every three rooms in this must have electricity at home for both the governments and private consultancy firms. That analyzing and measuring the progress of all of these. Let's take a look as an example. One of those targets was to make her one's at a gender equality haven ends. Now, the Rwandan constitution requires that at least 50 percent of all government positions held by women. In fact, at the time of making this video, there are ones in parliament, has the biggest share of female mps in the entire world and to the wage gap between men and women is lower than in countries as progressive as Denmark. Today, there is a brand new generation of female Rwandan entrepreneurs leading the country and what's more Rwanda is investing the small amounts of money they collected in taxes pretty wisely in a country where 80 percent of its population used to live off subsistence farming. The government is built power generators and roads that increase agricultural productivity. Now we're ones in farmers are beginning to export food to their neighbors.

Speaker 1:          10:15          All of this explains why 23 years after the genocide, Rwanda GDP is growing at an average rate of eight percent a year. This is similar to emerging economies like China or Vietnam on the same streets where in 1994 people were clubbing each other to death. Startups like Rwanda motorcycle company are being born. The motorcycle factory was created this year in 2017 with American investment. If you want to start a company in neighboring countries, you will need weeks or even months to deal with all the paperwork in Rwanda. You're done with all that in just two days. As of course, this has attracted a lot of foreign investors, especially from China and America, and so now you might be wondering how did they end up here? Once Polka gummies secrets welded, you have the answer. It has a light side, but it also has a dark side at gunpoint. Everyone believes it. Rwanda works. Streets are safe and tolerance between Hutus and Tutsis is imposed vinyl.

Speaker 2:          11:10          No,

Speaker 1:          11:14          no one's in constitution itself forbids the use of the words Tutsi and Hutus to refer to a person according to the government or citizens are Rwandans and no one should care about their tribe of origin. Either the media nor institutions are allowed to say anything that could spark hatred or open past scars and well, in fact, they call it even criticize the governance. Both the police and the military. They are present all over the country to make sure that everyone follows these laws. Yeah, it is true. Balking on me is a popular presidents in dd has his own youtube channel and to twitter and facebook account that he uses almost daily, but no one else has the freedom to express their ideas freely. Well, the same goes for other political parties. We're talking about the president. He's been in power for 17 years and he wins elections with outcomes higher than 95 percent of the votes. As you can imagine, you is not exactly democratic.

Speaker 4:          12:10          One of his opponents, friend Kevin, the only permitted opposition party hailed the process he had attempted to run for the 2010 presidential election party, was unable to register for the vote.

Speaker 1:          12:23          In other words, the Rwandan model is based on three pillars, ease of investing, and doing business infrastructure developments and at the top an authoritarian governments, they'd guarantee safety and tolerance at the expense of other human rights.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Now we want to know what your opinion is. Do you think that this lack of democracy is legitimate? If the country can step out of poverty or perhaps Rhonda would be better off if they structured the country in a more democratic in Western model? What?
