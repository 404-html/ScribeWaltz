Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          we told you in a previous video how Saudi Arabia wants to leave behind once and for all it's addiction to oil and it's become a nation similar to Dubai or Abu Dhabi. In this video we are going to look at the country in more depth in order to get an idea of just how this mission to get free from oil is going

Speaker 1:          00:24          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:29          The thing is there is a specific name, a leader behind this ambitious plan and my question to you is, do you know who this person is? Well, for those of you don't, the person who is turning everything upside down in Saudi Arabia is Mohammed bin Salman.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:46          My name alone, it doesn't explain much. So now you might be wondering who is this man really awesome his intentions and what exactly is he trying to do? While these are the questions that we're going to be answering in today's visual politic video, so let's get started. Shall We?

Speaker 2:          01:04          The Prince of change. He might only be a list of more than 30 years olds, but Mohammed bin Salman is already one of the most powerful people in the wells and he controls more money than we could ever possibly count formerly while he is the minister of Defense, deputy crown prince, second deputy prime minister, chief of the royal quarter and chair of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs. So what does all of this mean? Well, Mitt kinds of things that the hammer has been sell mom is in control of well everything. He's got complete control over the country's oil, over the massive financial reserves that had been accumulated over the years and also over Saudi Arabia's massive defense budgets. So today the power of the prince is practically total. Hey, well this isn't something normally that never has such a young man had so much power before. I've until now, the norm was for the country to be controlled by seniors have 80 or more years.

Speaker 2:          02:00          We were very reluctant to go for any kind of change, but all of a sudden changes in the foot because what Mohammed bin Salman is trying to do with Saudi Arabia is turn it into a new United Arab Emirates, a country which the prince has an enormous amount of admiration for later. We're going to see just how he is doing this, but for now you need to bear something in mind. The youth of the country chair been Salmaan as the savior of the kingdom and this is a country where half of its population is less than 25 years olds. And so in a country like that, it's pretty important. But so now you might be wondering, why does this man come from? How can such a young man who have so much power? Well, he's the son of the current king.

Speaker 2:          02:44          Wait just a second before you explained. Well of course he is because you need to know that being the son of the king in the Saudi Arabia wasn't always such an important thing. In fact, Banal Been Somal is not even the ad to the Saudi throne battle over the throne. It's all one bin. Abdulaziz is the king of Saudi Arabia. He is the son of the man who was considered the founder of the country. Abdulaziz been sold since cell died in 1953 the kingdom has been inherited by brother, BAFTA, brother Doula. Z's been sowed, had 17 known wives and it is calculated that he also had around 32 sons, so there were quite a few potential heirs. The thing is that when the current is king, he was believed to be the 25th son reached power a few years ago in 2015 the first thing he did was change the laws of succession even though some of his brothers are still alive, he has decided to put to the new generations in charge of this process to do this.

Speaker 2:          03:41          He has decided to appoint his nephew, Muhammad bin Nayef, who is closer to Washington than others and he has been in charge of security for the last few years as well as the secret services and the fight against fundamentalism. However, it seems like young, the Hamad bin Selma on the main character in this video it seems he's not very happy about that and it seems that he is taking aim at the throne. He wants to be the future king of Saudi Arabia, so here's eagerness for reforms could be explained as an attempt to to gain popularity. In fact that is what most analysts currently think that as well. It does make sense. The fall of the price of oil has given Mohammed bin Selma and the opportunity to aim for the throne, which is something his father obviously supports. If Saudi vision 2030 starts showing good result in, someone will be in a better position to ask for a reward and it's become potentially the new add to the throne. However, there are a few problems on the road ahead both for been some on as well as the country. On the one hand, there are problems inside the royal family. Then someone has made a lot of enemies who accused him of being power hungry. On the other hand, his father, the currents king is quite old, 81 years. He seems to have some memory issues.

Speaker 2:          04:49          So this means that there are two possible scenarios ahead. If the current's king, there was so many more years, the Prince bin on, we'll be able to consolidate his power. However, if the king doesn't live so long, the current had been some Alan's cousin could become the new king and wish goodbye. Both do the prints and his Saudi vision 2030

Speaker 1:          05:05          it

Speaker 2:          05:08          Mars. The reality is is that this is how Monica is work, but I'm pretty sure that some of you by now you're probably thinking, well this is all fascinating Simon, but why should I care what happens into Saudi Arabia? Well, you should. Katherine's probably more than you think. Saudi Arabia is still the biggest oil producer now and it is also the most important and influential country in the Arab.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Well,

Speaker 2:          05:34          evolution towards openness for this country. It could be something very positive for the world's cans for now, the plan, Saudi vision 2030 it seems to be the only opportunity for the country to progress and evolve. But now that we've said that, what exactly is the plan for this coming?

Speaker 1:          05:49          Sure. Incorrigibles

Speaker 2:          05:57          so far in today's story, we've seen a handsome prince and the battle over the throne, but we need a third ingredients for this Saudi soap opera, and that's luxury hands money. Well, of all the royal families in the world, the Saudis, the royal household of Saudi Arabia mights be the most addicted to money and luxury as well. Now you're going to see why, as we have mentioned in several videos, the fall of oil prices is jeopardized, many countries and among them is Saudi Arabia only in 2016 and even though many adjustments were made, the country had a deficit of more than $80 billion and is now the question becomes what can they do in order to fix such a hole in their budget? Well, in 2016 the Saudi government announced that the country was going to go on a diet. For the first time in decades, austerity reached Saudi Arabia. The government have been Salmaan started with reductions in public wages, cancelled many projects, whose profitability was uncertain, reduce subsidies and gasoline, water, electricity.

Speaker 1:          07:01          This,

Speaker 2:          07:06          it was a pretty huge shock for one of the most subsidized economies in the wells. I mean, up until now, do you have, you will oil. It helps pay for everything in Saudi Arabia. However, hold on for just a moment because, well, that's not the whole story. Under Solomon's rule, prince is still enjoy many material privileges. The subsidization system hasn't changed for the royal household. Take a look at this. The King of Saudi Arabia has ultra luxurious palaces all over the world that are available to him in Marbella in Spain. He has l Roseo a palace inspired by no less than the White House.

Speaker 2:          07:44          But I mean, it's gotta be pretty boring, right? I have to go to the same palace all the time. I mean, how tiresome so lost some of the king built a new and gigantic palace in Tangier. In Morocco. The palace has its very own hospital in here. The king gets French seafood delivered direct from France. But I mean, Hey, what's the problem with chartering a few airplanes so the king can eat some nice and lobsters? Right? Oh. And by the way, when the king of Saudi Arabia travels, he travels and big and his last tour around Asia in 2016 the king traveled with 1500 people and he took with him to Mercedes Benz s 600 limousines. In order to carry it all 27 planes had to be used. Yes. So it seems that this is what the royal family, you can sit as austerity and the print is our main character.

Speaker 2:          08:29          He's no different either. During holidays in France and at the same time, oil prices were falling. Print. Salmaan saw the yacht of the Russian magnate, Uri Sheffler. It was love at first sight. He sent an assistant right away in order to close the deal. Solman bought it for 550 million US dollars. Sorry. Now you know how the family likes to live animals? Well, they are quite a big family. It's all estimations indicate that the Saudi royal family has around 15,000 members. The government has evaded the question of membership numbers, but even low and estimates, but it did about 5,000 people. As we're talking about people who live thanks to the public budget and to have all kinds of privileges. They are paid impressive salaries. They have access to hospitals which are essentially five star palaces ans they do profitable business with the government. They have incredibly luxurious spends, honestly rather incredible lifestyles, and the reality is that that is very, very expensive according to estimations from the u s government. Since transparency is not a tradition in the royal family of, they spend about $2 billion every year in order to keep up their sumptuous lifestyle. Other estimates indicate the royal family takes over a million barrels of oil a day, which is 10% of the national production

Speaker 2:          09:48          progress of Saudi vision 2030

Speaker 2:          09:52          this wanting to all of this, the transition of Saudi Arabia plans in vision 2030 keeps moving forward. Saudi Arabia designs a city of entertainment almost as big as Las Vegas bosses. The truth is that it is moving slowly. Adams for the time being Saudi Arabia is regaining better relations with the United States. In fact, that Donald Trump's first international visitors, the u s presidents was to react. But yes, in order to achieve that to the Saudis had to sign some pretty big checks. Trump signs the single largest arms deal in US history with Saudi Arabia. We're $350 billion and this has to be added to the billion dollar contracts they already have with some of the largest companies in the United States and it all has a target in mind. Saudi Arabia wants to reinforce the protection it has from the u s to defendant for impossible enemies such as Iran. We're actually going to be discussing this special relationship in a future video, so please do not forget to subscribe, but leaving the u s aside in the last few months, Saudi Arabia has set the world's largest funder for technological investments. They have $100 billion available to invest further more. The country's eliminating many restrictions on foreign investments and some projects are being already discussed. Some of these have already been put into motion such as theme parks, huge hotel resorts, and even nuclear power plant

Speaker 1:          11:12          bus plus.

Speaker 2:          11:13          As we have been telling you, transforming this country won't be easy at all. And this is just the start of their very own soap opera. This is the huge money wastage of the royal family, which means they have to deal with a lot of criticism from the country's powerful religious leaders who by the way have a terrible lack of respect for civil rights. Then there is the war in Yemen and the uncertainty of the air to the Saudi throne. So now what do you think about the luxurious lifestyle of the Saudi royal family?
