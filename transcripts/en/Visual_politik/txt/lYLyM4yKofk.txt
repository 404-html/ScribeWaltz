Speaker 1:          00:07          Luxembourg is the only country in the world is prime minister is openly gay. We're talking about one of them is tolerance, open-minded societies on the planet. In fact, they have a population of around 500,000 inhabitants and 40 percent of them are immigrants. In other words, Luxembourg is the smallest country in the European Union, but the one with the biggest share of immigrants nonetheless, what made Luxenberg famous can be summarized in just one word. And that word is money. Yes. Do you have. You have the grants actually of Luxembourg is one of the three wealthiest countries on earth here. The minimum wage is around 2000 euros a month. No, that's not average wage. That's the minimum wage. The normal wage in Luxembourg. 5,000 euros a month for comparison. Luxembourgish people have a GDP per capita twice as big as that of Australians or the dangers. Alright. Alright. But just hold on for a second because that is a little trick in this figure. You see almost half of the work is in this country actually live outside of it. Everyday around 160,000 people commute to this country. And then go back to their homes in Germany, France, or Belgium. In other words, they create wealth in the country, but they don't live that. This is why when we divide Luxembourg's GDB among their population, we get such an enormous number,

Speaker 1:          01:39          even with these statistical deviations, no one can deny that Luxembourg is kind of a country for many ins and this explains why it's capital. Luxembourg city is among these cities in the world with the highest quality of life. Many of you might think that this can all be explained because Luxembourg is a fiscal haven, but the truth is that other countries like Malaysia and Cyprus also have low taxes, but they are not even half as rich as Luxembourg. So the big question here is what does Luxembourg happens that makes them so incredibly wealthy? What did they do in this country to enjoy such a fantastic quality of life

Speaker 2:          02:15          life today?

Speaker 1:          02:21          Well, we are going to answer that very question, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history. The kings of steel by the rag and 15, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg became an independent country. And I say independence because none of its neighbors really recognized its independence. France and Germany used to be back then for for control over the dap sheet on several occasions. In fact, despite their government's desire for independence, the territory of Luxembourg was owned by King William the third of the Netherlands. During these years, Luxembourg was far from being a wealthy country. Most of its citizens survived thanks to agriculture and iron mining back then, one in every five people from Luxembourg was emigrating to America. Nonetheless, living between two rival countries like France and Russia had its advantages too. You see, during this time, Germany didn't exist as a country. Instead, there were a lot of republics, kingdoms and Dutchies united under a confederation.

Speaker 3:          03:30          If you want to know what a confederation is, well click on this video. The truth is all the German states traded among themselves that basically created a special free trade zone, which they called the silver, right? All right, so in 1942, Luxembourg became a member of the zollverein. And since that point history, what? It would never be the same again. As I said before, poor Luxembourg was based on two main industries, agriculture and iron mining, and remember here, these are the times of the industrial revolution, still was needed for, well, basically everything. It was used in everything from machines to buildings and Luxembourgish citizens while they were sitting on top of a pile of iron,

Speaker 1:          04:12          but not only that, we're talking about a tiny country placed in the intersection between France, Germany, and Belgium. In other words, it was the perfect points. Have a railroad so they could send the iron to all three countries. All of a sudden, Luxembourg became ground zero for all of these trade routes as well as one of the biggest steel providers on the planet. In fact, many of those New York skyscrapers were built with beams made in this country. This is why the biggest steel companies are luxembourgish. The biggest of them all. Arcelor. Mittal is one that you might have even heard about and financial newspapers, and although as in just a few decades, Luxembourg gone to the same level as its neighbors, but still it was not the economic dmf what it is today. They still need to

Speaker 3:          05:01          special sauce. That special sauce was this

Speaker 1:          05:08          29? This is the year when Luxembourg past the holding goal bonds. Wait just a minute here because you might be wondering, well, what's corporate holding all about? Well, let's take a cookie cutter as an example. On the one hand, Coca Cola isn't beverage brand, but on the other hand that is the Coca Cola company. This is a big conglomerate that contains other companies like Faenza Schweppes or Coca Cola, the beverage brand.

Speaker 2:          05:35          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:35          so this big conglomerates is called a holding corporation that owns the company, his insight it alcohol subsidiary companies. These subsidiaries can be in different countries and all the guys who produce and distribute the drinks. However, the role of the holding company is mainly to manage the property of these other subsidiary companies. All right, so this 19, 29 law, it's offered amazingly good tax conditions to those holding companies.

Speaker 3:          05:58          Basically they paid around one percent

Speaker 2:          06:01          tap.

Speaker 1:          06:06          These were the 19 thirties and back then there wasn't as many holding companies as there are today. Johnson, remember, those were the years when Coca Cola was starting to expand to other markets, so Luxembourg was doing great, but they still want the drawing where they are today. In other words, Luxembourg was growing but not that much more than other countries.

Speaker 2:          06:25          Yes.

Speaker 3:          06:32          Nonetheless, the seventies were other times when American companies conquered the European and Asian markets that finally had some money to spend on consumer goods. During these years, many of the big corporations we know today were born. In other words, a lot of holding sprang up and their profits came from all around the planets. So where did they decide to set up their headquarters? Well, since they could choose anywhere they wanted to, they went to the places with the best fiscal conditions. Luxembourg has everything they want, says a whole lot more. You see, by the 19 sixties and seventies, the country already had a big banking industry. The best lawyers, accountants and economists were living there ready to help those big companies in order to take advantage of those business friendly laws. And this is how this little country glance into their silver decades.

Speaker 1:          07:22          Yes. Do you believe what you see the economy of Luxembourg became two times bigger in less than six years compared to this. China or Singapore is great rate. It's kind of a joke and yes, you heard that right? I did say before silver decade, because all of this growth was nothing compared to what was to come. Think about it. We are already talking about the two thousands, the age of the online business. Boom. These brand new corporate juggernauts operated all over the world, had dozens of subsidiary companies in every country are not concentrated in any specific location because they sold every year. In other words, these tech companies were made some of Luxembourg, so if you've got this country, it was already astoundingly rich and could have grown more well, do you think?

Speaker 2:          08:10          Twice

Speaker 3:          08:21          amazing, isn't it? I don't know if you noticed this, but in just five years, Luxembourg's GDP per capita, I went from 50,000 US dollars, which is already a lost over $100,000 when you live in the country where the GDP per capita of over $100,000

Speaker 1:          08:36          can fill the old swimming pool with champagne. In fact, the Audi a three is the third best selling car in

Speaker 4:          08:50          and yes.

Speaker 3:          08:51          Well, they probably do know what you're thinking right now. You think that this country has made its fortune by companies avoid paying taxes, right? Well beyond, sir. It's a little bit more complicated than that. You see the facts that are holding corporation is located in Luxembourg, uh, does not mean that its subsidiary companies don't pay taxes elsewhere. For instance, Amazon has its headquarters in Luxembourg. Nonetheless, it's British subsidiary that is the company that sells products and managers and logistics in this country still has to pay taxes in the UK, or at least that is the theory. In fact, the reality is way different school lux leaks. So let's get back to our Amazon example. As we said, the profits of his British subsidiary are taxed in the UK rice. Well, the question that then comes up is, what if they don't have any profits whatsoever? Imagine that right after they pay taxes, Amazon UK gets a big loan, a big loan with a really high interest rates so high in fact, that the company takes losses and who lends them that money? Exactly. Well, of course, that would be Amazon Holdings in Luxembourg. This weight, these subsidiary companies have almost no profits. One way or another, they managed to send them money to the Luxembourg brunch and that's what you said before in Luxembourg. Taxes are really low for companies.

Speaker 1:          10:05          Of course,

Speaker 3:          10:06          this is perfectly legal bus. In 2009 during the financial crisis, the American governments realized the huge amounts of money they were losing with all of these big companies moving overseas.

Speaker 5:          10:15          That's why today I'm announcing a set of proposals to crack down on illegal overseas tax evasion, close loopholes and make it more profitable for companies to create jobs here in the United States.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Since then, other governments have also followed in Obama's steps. Now, don't forget, Luxembourg is one of the European Union's founding members. His name is the other club. Members were angry and willing to lay on a lot of political pressure, but the biggest crisis for this country came in the year 2014. This was the time when a group of accountants released a ton of private data for these big corporations.

Speaker 4:          10:54          Thanks

Speaker 1:          10:55          so called Lux leaks. We could all see the tax evasion strategies employed by thousands of different companies. Now, do you remember what I told you about loans between different subsidiary companies within a holding. Well, here is another way of improving the deal. You see all these big companies hire big consulting firms so they can help them with their accounting consulting firms like pricewaterhouse coopers with a big customer portfolio in Luxembourg. That enough power to sit down with the prime minister back then, John Golan, Jamaica, and arrange a special tax deal. No current spotlight after Luxembourg. Tax Revelations, the leaked documents demonstrate tax arrangements negotiated by price waterhouse coopers. As you could imagine, the release of the luxleaks was a total game changer. In fact, this year, 2017 Luxembourg past a brand's new fiscal reform and probably many of these arrangements are going to have to change, but hold on just a minute here because this doesn't mean that is going to stop being a rich place. In fact, the opposite is probably true. Despite this political turbulence, the country group at a rate of four point two percent last year, this is way faster than almost any other country in Europe having so many savings. Luxembourg has invested in many other industries. Now, of course, they have steel. They have their bank suddenly also have space.

Speaker 4:          12:17          Yes.

Speaker 1:          12:21          Burgs bent on space. Industry shows early signs of success. Yep. You heard that right? In fact, Luxembourg in the United States of the first countries to pass laws regulating space mining, and this tiny country is expected to become the Silicon Valley of the aerospace industry. This explains partly some of the details of the 2017 fiscal reform. Of course, the government of Luxembourg doesn't want to help big corporations avoid taxes. At least this is what they say officially. Instead, they have reduced taxes for smaller companies and are actively trying to improve conditions in order to encourage more tech startups. But this is a subject for another video

Speaker 3:          13:01          question for you is do you think we're gonna? See another moment of skyrocketing growth in Luxembourg economy.
