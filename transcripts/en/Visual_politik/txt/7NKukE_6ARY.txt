Speaker 1:          00:08          It's known as the lucky

Speaker 2:          00:10          train,

Speaker 1:          00:14          amazing beaches, a great deal of natural life spans, many, many natural resources. This is Australia, a surface paradise, and they send it to the sport of cricket. For those who are unaware, that's a British sport where there is even a break for tea. Australia is give us something special and unique country. Eighty percent of its plants and animals don't exist anywhere else on the planet. Everything is so different in Australia compared to the rest of the world, but even its characteristic animal, the national symbol, it doesn't even run or even fly. It jumped. Australia is a natural environment is not only unique, it's also rather terrifying. Australia has more deadly things than any other place in the wells. For example, all of the 10 most poisonous snakes in the weld off from Australia. Not enough evidence for you. Well, what about some other examples of the deadly Australian ecosystem and have a look at these four animals,

Speaker 3:          01:12          the funnel web, spider box jellyfish, the blue ringed octopus and the stone fish. They're all in Australia and they're the deadliest of their kind.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Just be careful because, well, there's much, much more

Speaker 3:          01:26          crocodiles that weighed more than 1500 kilograms sharks of all kinds and sizes, and if animals don't scare you enough, don't feel safe. Yet there were many more natural dangers of all kinds because this is a dry, hot and aggressive climate.

Speaker 1:          01:43          How would that. None of these things have stopped Australia in any way from becoming a dream, the millions of people who dream of a better future. It's certainly logical. I mean take a look at some of the incredible places we can find in this country. This is the gold coast. I'll tell you, we are not only referring to regular folks here who are heading to Australia for a brighter future in the last few years. Australia has been like a magnet for millionaires as well, but the big question is why to find out. I'll be honest with that. We're going to have to leave the animals aside and talk to some business

Speaker 2:          02:21          Australia.

Speaker 3:          02:21          Yeah, a magnet for big fortune.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Everyday it gets easier to move around the world. Today. We can reach almost any place in a quick, comfortable and affordable way for further thanks to the Internet and all kinds of new communication methods. You can run a business from wherever you want and just look at how things have changed

Speaker 3:          02:40          just 50 years ago for a trip between London and Sydney. We have to make many stops on the way and it never took less than three days. Same trip can now be done in much less time and a bit more than 20 hours on a comfortable plain, safe and with various films, TV series and music. You can arrive

Speaker 1:          03:04          because of this increase in the ease of traveling communications, wealthy business people have become more demanding of their country, of residence. After all, they can now easily choose where they prefer to live without it affecting their business. It's not only attractive taxes that affect the choice of where a wealthy person lives. They also want to live in places with high standards of living where it's easy to do business and whether a good schools as well as safety in terms of both physical security as well as judicial safety. The last meaning they can leave their savings safely, deposited somewhere safe in the knowledge that it won't be seized by a corrupt politician or they've had an argument,

Speaker 2:          03:39          okay,

Speaker 3:          03:41          64 percent of Chinese millionaires have either immigrated or plan to immigrate taking their spending and their fortunes with them

Speaker 1:          03:48          and Australia. Wealth. It has a lot to offer these millionaires. On the one hand, it is the fifth most free economy in the world. It is very easy to do business that I'm. There are plenty of opportunities for business. The justice system also works incredibly well and it has a very competitive financial system and regulations as a general rule. Plus on the other hand, it's one of the countries with the highest standard of living in the world because there are a huge number of quality services like hospitals, universities, and

Speaker 3:          04:19          cool.

Speaker 1:          04:21          In fact, year after year, Australia's big cities maintain the highest positions in the international rankings in terms of quality of life. As an example, Melbourne for six years in a row now has led the quality of life rankings as compiled by the economist. This means it must be a pretty wonderful place.

Speaker 2:          04:40          I'm sweating.

Speaker 1:          04:42          That wasn't enough. The country recently created an open door projects for people with significant fortunes

Speaker 3:          04:48          in Australia. Millionaires willing to invest about three point $5, million US dollars can obtain a permanent residence card and if they fall a little bit short, if this three point $5,000,000 figure, they can still get a lot of advantages with $750,000.

Speaker 2:          05:03          Great

Speaker 1:          05:03          standards of living, ease of doing business and open doors. What do you think the results of all of this has been? Well, that's pretty interesting. In both 2015 and 2016, Australia has been the country whether most millionaires have moved to beating out even the United States in 2006 in particular. $11,000 million as moved to Australia, which is an unbelievable figure for a country whose population is less than 25 million and honestly that might be the best indicator of the unstoppable Australian

Speaker 2:          05:33          economy.

Speaker 3:          05:38          Best version of the United States.

Speaker 1:          05:40          When you arrived in Australia, some say that they feel they've arrived and an improved version of the United States. That is to say in general, the city's system and society in both countries is quite similar.

Speaker 3:          05:52          Australia, even as its own Washington DC, a capital city built for and by the politically powerful. Now some might forget, but the capital city of Australia is not Sydney or Melbourne. It's Canberra,

Speaker 2:          06:05          right?

Speaker 1:          06:08          The truth is you could mistake Australia for America at first if it wasn't for the fact that cars are on the wrong side of the roads and there are statues of Queen Victoria decorating the cities. As an interesting aside, it Australia is still technically a monarchy and it's queen this Queen Elizabeth Second. Well, the thing is that besides all of the similarities, Australia is a safer, cleaner, more modern, more cosmopolitan, more prosperous country, and Australians are also richer than American.

Speaker 3:          06:40          When Australians visit the US, they see a country in decline. Australian see the bad airports, the infrastructure, the poor, the becker.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Now maybe you can understand why people think Australia is something of an improved USA. Generally speaking, international media doesn't pay a ton of attention to Australia, but this really shouldn't be the case because this is a country that hasn't seen an economic crisis in 26 years. In fact, the last time the country went through a crisis, Gorbachev was in power in the Soviet Union. No battery.

Speaker 4:          07:11          Yeah, the phone that he had always thought of you.

Speaker 1:          07:16          No financial crisis like crisis over raw materials. No unemployment's seemingly no problems at all in Australia. And so the question is now, what's the result of all of this prosperity with a population of just 24 million inhabitants, it's economy is already as big as Russia now. It is also important to note that Australia is very dependent on its raw materials. They make up more than half of its exports.

Speaker 3:          07:43          20 19. Australia will replace gutter as the world's leading natural gas export.

Speaker 1:          07:49          So when the prices of raw material started to fall, it seems there's Australia would be facing a situation similar to those which occurred in Russia, Brazil, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, et cetera. It seemed as if the good times were about to come to an end, but the reality, the reality is entirely different. In Australia, unlike almost every other producing nation, the crisis in raw materials didn't cause any harm. So what is it that makes Australia almost invulnerable to any kinds of crisis? Well, let's have a look.

Speaker 3:          08:19          The secret of success.

Speaker 2:          08:23          Lazy.

Speaker 1:          08:23          I regularly follow visual politic. You already know that. We like to say good policies, good results, but that is exactly what Australia has done in the last few decades. They've had reformance. The changes weren't many, so we'll just mention some of the most important ones. First, the government decided to battle opening up the economy. International Trade, removing most terrorists. The country is today, a from defender of free trade agreements.

Speaker 2:          08:53          Exactly. Seconds

Speaker 1:          08:53          in the early nineties, the Labor is of poor. Keating decided to start a retirement system known as super annuation based on capitalization, so each worker saves and invest a part of their salary to pay for their retirements. In this way, the Australian system is similar to the one in Chile. The results are absolutely outstanding. The program has allowed people to generate large quantities of savings which have been invested in the productive economy. Besides all this money saved has launched the finance industry. For example, Australia is already one of the most important markets for investment funds and it isn't just that Australia has the world's highest growth rate for finance technology. Third in 1995, they started the national competition policy, the aim of which was to reduce state interventionism in many sectors. This program allowed for the elimination of almost 20,000 rules and regulations which restricted competition. Also an ambitious program for privatization and the elimination of state monopolies was launched and you want to know an example from this. Well that would be quantified

Speaker 5:          09:52          today. You're flying on a quad bike.

Speaker 2:          09:55          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:04          and three big major changes. As in addition to that, we also have budget stability in labor flexibility. Then so on and so forth. And so what has been the result of all of this? Well, that's 25 years without a recession and economy with no unemployment as an average salary of more than $5,000 a month. And that's not even mentioning the tons of foreign investment. Sounds pretty good, right? Well, we did visual politic. We will draw the conclusion that it is wrong for a country to blame the price of raw materials for a financial crisis. They simply didn't do their homework. And do you know who did do that? Home work? Wellbe? Yeah, that's Australia. So what do you think? Do you think that Australia is a great destination for the wealthy? Do you think that the country could be to the 21st century?
