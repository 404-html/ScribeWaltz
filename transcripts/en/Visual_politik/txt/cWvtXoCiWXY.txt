Speaker 1:          00:08          Today there are about 25 countries without an army, but I'll ask you which one of them was fast? Which country do you think was the first he voluntarily give up its armed forces. If you guys do European country, you're not even on the right continence. It was actually a Latin American country and that was of course Costa Rica on December the first 19, 48 after a civil war under president and Jose Figueroa. As Fair as administration, Costa Rica puts an end to its military career and you know what? This wasn't actually a bad mood. Send the country hasn't had a single wall or a single key. In fact, Costa Rica can boast about being the country with the longest, uninterrupted period of democratic governments in Latin America because Dvo north again, to the enormous way that the military boot has traditionally had on last and American.

Speaker 2:          01:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Then there's the fact that Costa Rica is located in one of the most violent regions in the world. Central America.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Despite this, this tropical country located between the Caribbean sea and the Pacific Ocean has managed to become a middle income country with quite high levels of prosperity. So what's the recipe here? Well, prosperity, peace and safety. These are the ingredients that have made Costa Rica habitually known as the Switzerland of Latin in America. Now, what is true in all of this, and in this video we want to tell you a bit more about Costa Rica. We want to have a look good. It's light, but also at its shadows. So let's dive in.

Speaker 2:          01:47          Just a happy face,

Speaker 1:          01:55          however we look at it. Costa Rica is a very special country. Divya, we're talking about a country whose hallmark color is green because of Costa Rica is associated with anything. It's bio diverse. You see with an area that's almost 10 times smaller than that of Spain or 25 times smaller than Peru. This country is estimated to have more than five percent of all the world's animal and plant biodiversity in this country. They understand this is not just a sign of identity, but also a potentially great competitive advantage, for example, among other things. It can help develop a differentiated tourism industry and position a strong country brands that is to say, one that gives high value to local products, especially for international,

Speaker 2:          02:40          yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:42          because they wouldn't be willing to pay a bit more for products considered to be produced cleanly in an environmental haven and Costa Rica and while they take these policies very, very seriously, Costa Rica strives to be an ecological power is it absolutely is more than 25 percent of national territory is protected and the vast majority of electricity comes from renewable sources, hydroelectric, geothermal and wind power, and not only that, Costa Rica is the only country in the region. Man's one of the few in the world that has managed to reverse deforestation. The territory covered by forests has increased from 21 percent in 1987 to over 50 percent in the present.

Speaker 1:          03:27          The thing that, by the way, they achieved thanks to a curious payment system for environmental services. Allow me to explain this. In Costa Rica, a part of the taxes on fuels goes to funds at Costa Rican forest financing or funds that pays farm and forest owners. He wants to join the program voluntarily to conserve their natural space and implement projects that help strengthen it and that's not all. Many companies also pay into this fund to offset their impacts on the environment. Something like corporate social responsibility that's promoted by the states. Now I think this leads to a really interesting debate because for some this policy is a bit of a monstrosity, whereas for others it will be a way of recognizing the negative externalities of productive activities such as the pollution caused by factories and also of course there's the positive externalities. All natural areas, half of our territory is covered by forest and we have an apple system of protected areas that not only protect an important part of the planet's biodiversity, but also sustain important sectors of our economy. As for example, tourism. Carlos Alvarado, president of Costa Rica. Personally, I believe that if these types of initiatives are accompanied by policies that promote the creation of companies and new types of businesses, they could be really successful. But let's leave it open to debate. You can let us know what you think of all of this in the comments, but now let's move on.

Speaker 1:          04:51          The fact is that this type of political approach doesn't seem to have been at odds with the country's economic growth since the year 2000. The Costa Rican economy has grown by around four percent every year, which even if it doesn't seem like much has been a higher average growth rate than that of the rest of Latin America and the OACD countries.

Speaker 2:          05:08          Yes,

Speaker 1:          05:10          and that's not all Costa Rica is undergoing something similar to what we saw with New Zealand's. If we measure variables besides GDP, for example, if we consider life expectancy, salaries and situation of companies, et Cetera, et Cetera, I think Costa Rica comes out even better. Take a look at the the Gotham prosperity index and the ranking of countries by GDP per capita in purchasing power parity. That is taking price differences into account. If we do, we'll notice the Costa Rica is GDP per capita is the sixth laundries didn't last in America. That is, it's below Chile, Panama, Uruguay, Argentina and Mexico and 76 in the wells. In the global prosperity index, Costa Rican rises to the 29th place being the second country in Latin America, closely behind, if you want some clear proof, the average life expectancy in Costa Rica is the third highest in the entire American continents. Being higher, for example, then the last of the United States, Costa Rica, it looks like a prosperous, peaceful country, committed to the preservation of the environment, which all sounds pretty great, right? Well, hold on for a moment because this country has another face. Costa Rica is facing very complicated challenges, so listen up challenges that threatened the country.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Costa Rica is a country that has achieved great things, especially if we can pair this with many of its neighbors. However, right now it's facing political, economic, and social challenges that threaten its path to prosperity. The first one, clearly it's got a lot to do with the economy. See, even though Costa Rica has had a solid performance, it still has a long way to go. Currently its GDP per capita is just over 40 percent of the average for the country.

Speaker 2:          07:05          Yes.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Here's the problem. The last government was, how do you want to say it, a bit irresponsible with their fiscal policy, which left Costa Rica in a rather delicate situation only in the last 10 years. The public debt has more than doubled in terms of GDP for 2018. Deficit will approach is seven percent and one of every $3 of public spending will go towards paying that debt. While in 2008 taxes finance, 70 percent of all central government expenditures in 2017, they were only enough to finance 50 percent and the difference had to be covered with debtedness Jorge corellas consider. Fortunately, that seems to be a political consensus. If the situation doesn't change, Costa Rica could face several problems, but mainly focusing on raising taxes could also be counter productive. The country's tax on corporate profits is already one of the highest in the world. It's not only taxes. For example, the cost of electricity and fuel, which lies in the hands of public monopolies are among some of the most expensive in the region, which obviously affects competitive.

Speaker 2:          08:07          Yes,

Speaker 1:          08:14          increases like these. The labor participation rates, the rate of people who work is really rather low. The president's call us Alvarado really needs to open up the economy and allow competition and if possible, set apart so that the large public companies can be shared by Costa Rican. The second challenge has to do with violence. In recent years, violence has grown and loss in a country that was traditionally very safe and very quiet and well. This does have a simple explanation. Drug traffickers, Yup. As you may already know, drug traffickers are ravaging a large parts of Latin America and now they're trying to extend influence to Costa Rica, which is a good path for that much and dice third, well, the third challenge has a lot to do with politics. The last elections were a good example of how radical and populist messages that targets civil liberties are a great threat.

Speaker 1:          09:12          See the first electoral rounds held in February. It wasn't one by Carlos Alvarado this by for Bricio Alvarado and evangelist pastor, who has a very radical discourse among his obsessions with pursuing any societal model that differed from what he perceived as convenient, especially anything related to equal marriage, and of course anyone can see what they want and lead their lives however they please, but when a politician wants the government to keep devoted itself to religion and persecute those who don't agree with their life model, it can become really dangerous. Is Laura Musca. Fabrizio Alvarado, his wife in the middle of their campaign and don't try and tell me that she's not scary. Generally in the second round, this evangelical pastor who's speech had a lot of hatred and varied as a loved suffered, a crushing defeat even though he still won 30 percent of the votes, but it's this sort of populism that Costa Rica is going to have to be very careful within the future, but it's if view. That's kind of the way things are. Carlos Alvarado has just been elected president and it's now in his hands to get Costa Rica back on track. To achieve this, you'll have to change a lot of things and don't forget that the best way to fight poverty is by promoting more dynamic, open and competitive economies. Companies are new question going to have to play a prominent role in order

Speaker 2:          10:34          of this,

Speaker 1:          10:37          but now I see. What do you think that Costa Rica is? Green model is one other countries should follow. Do you think the Costa Rica itself is a model to follow?
