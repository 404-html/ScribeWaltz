Speaker 1:          00:09          Hell is the question. What would you say is a drug? Traffic has biggest dream,

Speaker 2:          00:14          blow blow, Romo, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop sites or pornography go.

Speaker 1:          00:22          All right. Allow me to explain myself because we all have dreams. You mean politicians and of course drug traffickers, they are no exception. They are people too. There may be hard to believe in law, sort of the ruthless and cruel drug trafficking in industry because there are human beings with names. And in this case also nicknamed zoo. Just like everyone else have dreams. So let's get back to my original question. What is the biggest dream that a drug trafficker could have? I mean, of course they might be different possible answers and it cause we're all individuals. But unfortunately history tells us that if most drug traffickers good, make a wish, just one single wish, it would be to turn the country into a narco state. That is to say they would turn them into states, run by a kind of criminal corporation, meetup of politicians, public officials, judges, the police and the military, which in one way or another we're associated with drugs way drug traffic is good. Basically Act with impunity. Exporting and distributing narcotics is without any restrictions. Very recently here on visual politic, we spoke about how the bolivarian regime of Nicolas Maduro dl start Okabe Oh and the cartel de los [inaudible] was turning Venezuela into a narco state. However, in Latin America, a politics that goes far beyond Venezuela. In this video, we're going to find out it's a bit more about one character who was able to promote the alliance between the narcotics industry and politicians, so listen up

Speaker 2:          01:43          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:52          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Narco populism.

Speaker 3:          01:55          We,

Speaker 1:          01:57          no, it's the narcotics industry is one of the most important illegal businesses every year and moved several hundred billion dollars. Now allow me to ask another question. Do you think that are cartel can survive without political support? Can they survive without controlling the institutions in some way? To answer this question. Let's go back to the beginning and take a look at how the most important drug dealers of all time managed to do it. It's because even though it's true that in the beginning, drug traffickers started out as little more than a band of outlaws. The time came when this all changed. A time came and so did it. Protagonists, Blue Escobar Gaviria considered by Forbes magazine to be one of the richest men of his time on the entire planet. According to Forbes in 1987 Pablo Escobar had a fortune that exceeded $2 billion and Escobar, he radically changed the global drug industry.

Speaker 3:          02:50          Great.

Speaker 1:          02:53          See on the one hand, so you created an entire network of criminal holding company that included businesses like kidnapping, murder, and of course their main activity of drug trafficking. All of these activities were perfectly integrated into a structure. The metagene cartel, which has a clear organizational chart, a well defined hierarchy, and even a zone based distribution network, each with its own managers talking in business speak these words sort of like franchises or branches. On the other hand is regarding his main business drugs. This cartel, the Mexican cartel, achieved an almost complete vertical integration. That is the cartel took over the harvest, the production, the distribution, and the marketing of the vast majority of its merchandise. They did everything and they took over every single stage of the business. That's how the Medellin cartel and managed to bring in more than $7 billion per year. Of course, none of this would've been possible without the complicity of the public authority. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          03:56          Lee Escobar reached the top of the cocaine cartel by astutely reinvesting his initial earnings and becoming a PR master in Colombia. With his growing wealth. Escobar bought a newspaper in Midian, gained influence in Colombian politics and he successfully ran for public office becoming an alternative to the national congress. David Henry Forbes magazine, 1987

Speaker 1:          04:26          you see, for many years, Pablo Escobar had impunity with his money and threads. The well known phrase of Silver [inaudible]. He managed to infiltrate the Colombian state. He bribes the military, politicians, governors, and the police in such a way that many Colombian institutions were under his command for a long time and that's not all. Pablo Escobar also financed electoral campaigns to win popular support. And what does a politician do when he wants to gain popularity fast? Well, he promoted projects like the building of houses for the nation's poorest citizens as well as distributing provisions and creating soccer field. It's pretty good, doesn't it? I mean at first glance, kind of like a Colombian Robin Hood, too bad. The truth was rather defer while he was carrying out this type of campaign. He had no qualms about flooding the streets with violence and blood. Welcome to knock a popular, as you will probably know, Pablo Escobar managed to hold a seat in the Colombian parliaments in 1982 until then, thanks to his political influence and his pr strategies, he was able to build his embar and is huge fortune with the

Speaker 4:          05:34          osmosis impunity. A member of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency once said that importing exotic animals for his zoo caused escobar more problems with the government. That is drug business. David Henry

Speaker 1:          05:48          now, oh, hold on just a second. Don't think the Pablo Escobar's political relations, what limited to Colombia at all after being elected as a deputy, the, it became untenable, but some members of the media began telling the truth behind his fortune. The DEA is pressure multiplied. A lot of Colombian society understood the huge danger that's Pablo Escobar posed and other cartels, they began to fear the power that the median cartel would grow into. That's when the government began to persecute this capo, which in a way declared war on the Colombian state itself and just to be safe. The first thing Escobar did was leave the country less. Td hunted down

Speaker 3:          06:31          the lead, sorry,

Speaker 1:          06:36          Pablo Escobar put some space between himself and Columbia. The question is, where could he find refuge? Would his drug money be enough to strengthen his alliances? Well, it seems absolutely so. First of all, there was panel at that time, the military dictator manual, Antonio Noreaga offered asylum protection and to root to transport his merchandise. So imagine this industry was so powerful that even dictators were willing to sell their services. The fact is that as you can see in her ego, also turns Panama into a narco state. That is until 1989 when a lightening invasion by the United States removed him from power. He was detained, taken to the United States, and given 30 years in prison for his drug trafficking and his relationship with a median cartel.

Speaker 1:          07:25          This, this is not the end of Palu Escobar's external alliances. The truth is that he didn't feel very safe and Panama either. I mean, yes, the dictator of the country was his pal, but the CIA had a very large presence in the country. So when he needs to expected it to, Nuria could be attempted to sell him out because of course it was one thing to do business with a Panamanian dictator. It's quite another to and trust him with his protection. He needed to find a new destination. So through the left wing, Colombian guerrilla movements am 19 Pablo Escobar contacted the Nicaraguan government.

Speaker 3:          07:57          Don't remember

Speaker 1:          08:00          the Sandinista government board led by the country's current president. Daniel Ortega was willing to welcome them with open arms in exchange for a commission, you know, for services rendered. The agreement specified that in addition to settling in the country with his family, if Pablo could use some of Nicaragua, was regions as a drug distribution platform, the problem or take her in his friends, they were very greedy. So a few months later, Pavlo decided to return to Columbia, but of course he maintained his business relations. This mole along with Nicaragua, the m 19 gorillas also facilitated the median cartels contacts with the Cuban governor.

Speaker 3:          08:38          Yup, that's

Speaker 1:          08:39          right. Cuba was also a trading platform for Pablo Escobar's businesses. In fact, it is known that Pablo Escobar maintained good relations with the Castro brothers, although truthfully, it seems that he wasn't the only one. All evidence indicates that after Escobar rather drug dealers continue to use during the Castro is to introduce all types of narcotics into the United States anyway, Colombia, Panama, and Nicaragua. Cuba. As you can see, a political power was one of the main drivers of the huge presence of drug trafficking and Latin America. The lack of transparency, the corruption, lack of counterweights and weak institutions where a perfect breeding grounds for what over the years became one of the great and nightmares of this region. And yes, some of you might now be thinking, well, all right Simon, but in the end, Pablo Escobar, he fell from power. Yeah, it's true, but when a man like Escobar falls, it doesn't mean that the industry falls and can order their relations with political power. Let's have a look at Mexico.

Speaker 3:          09:37          The relay,

Speaker 1:          09:41          the main Mexican cartel with which Pablo Escobar had a relationship was the Guadalajara cartel led by Anesto Fon, second, Rafael Caro, Quintero and Niguel and hell Felix Guyardo. This cartel had full impunity for two decades. All thanks to their relations with people in power. See Felix, Guy Otto was in charge of public relations and thanks to his ability to move within the highest political spheres. This cartel had all the stability it needed to develop and grow. Pr Is really important.

Speaker 1:          10:14          We're talking about a criminal industry and in criminal organizations, stability is very hard to achieve. In this case, the assaults on the dea agents on reggae arena, which ends it, his life made Washington demands the dismantling of this cartel and it's neat as fell one by one, but this didn't end the business from prison in 1989 Phoenix Guyardo tried to reorganize the territories, but in the absence of an agreement with the cartel, it's listened to the tijuana cartel led by the Ra on her brothers and the Sinaloa cartel led by Hector Louis Palmar Salazar, [inaudible] Palmer and Hakim Guzman Maria. Okay, I'll chapo. They both debuted on the Forbes list in 2009 with an estimated 14 of more than $1 billion.

Speaker 3:          10:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:58          The fact is that under El Chapo has come on, the scene or lower cartel became the most important and influential cartel in Mexico and one of the most important criminal organizations in the world. The question that many of you might be asking now is how did he do it? How can one cartel grow so much more than its adversaries? What above all, it's because of political influences. For example, how do you prevent the federal police from cashing you and nine your business? Well, you would do that by finding out a, when those raids are going to happen, everything is based on good relations and that's precisely what El Chapo made sure that he would have inflammation and friends, uh, power as we've seen in other cases. I'll chappy's capture it. Didn't really change the panorama today. This isn't a lower cartel is controlled by Ismael l mayors and Bardo, who over the years has been known to buy officials from the special prosecutor's office, the Attorney General's office, and even the Counter Narcotics Intelligence Center and elite army corps creators to fight narcotics. Obviously they don't do these businesses alone. In many cases, they have the approval or participation of the authorities Fj our researcher at the University of Guadalajara, this is all done in complicity with senior government official

Speaker 1:          12:11          only that explains these criminal groups, power, strength and resilience. We're talking about it, but let's go power with which in many cases norcos create a symbiosis that is hard to distinguish. That's what's happening in Venezuela with a soulless cartel of which we've already spoken here on visual politic and watch out because it's estimated that the Mexican and Venezuelan cartels control 70% of all drugs and tend to the United States.

Speaker 1:          12:34          That's what happens in countries like Guatemala where some sources, states and the time to 80% of all the white powder could be mediated by members of the national army itself. Oh, what's happening in Honduras where even the son of former presidents Porfirio Lobo has been condemned in the United States for drug trafficking activities while his own father was president of the republic. Anyway, folks, that is the result of having weak institutions, a lack of transparency and the lack of counterweights in future videos. We're going to talk more about this issue, which is becoming very expensive class in American countries. With this video, we just wanted to show you a few examples of how some of the greater norcos succeeded largely thanks to their influence on established institutions.
