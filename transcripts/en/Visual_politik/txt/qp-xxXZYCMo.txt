Speaker 1:          00:01          Is this someone controlling capitalism behind the scenes? You've heard about the Reptilians, the Rothschild family, even George Soros. This is one player with much more power than any of these guys and nobody's ever told you about them. That of course is the government of Norway.

Speaker 2:          00:29          Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:29          No way is more than just a very, very rich country. It's governments can have a real sway on international businesses. Think I've gotten enough swell at the end of this video. You are absolutely going to see where I'm coming from. No way is the only country on the planet where say tannic black metal songs are on the billboard shots. Yes. My idea of you, if you ever travel to this country and turn up your radio, you might find yourself not listening to Taylor swift, but instead bands like kroger off man or little meister and that famous hit titled My ass. Ah, so yes, there might be something a little odd going on with the music in this country, but Norway is one of the richest countries on the planet's thing in the same league as Ireland and Switzerland, but not only that, they're also. One of the most egalitarian, this means that the difference between the rich and the poor is fairness.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:39          That welfare state is big. That taxes are high and their lifestyle is good, but I'm betting yet already probably know this. What you probably don't know is that noise influence on the international economy is way bigger than it looks. Yes, Norway is behind the scenes of one of the biggest corporations on the planet,

Speaker 2:          02:01          but

Speaker 1:          02:01          seriously, don't leave this video right now. I know what you're thinking and. No, no, no. This video is most definitely not a crossover with Alex Jones use no way. As a population of less than 5 million inhabitants, New York City has more people nonetheless. These 5 million people have big shares in the welds. Major corporations. Yep. You heard that right? The government of Norway has its own hedge fund and they are among the main shareholders in a lot of companies like apple, facebook, and Tesla knowing might not have a big tree, but they have an army of money ready to influence the world's economy. So the question now is, well, why is Norway so rich and powerful? How to do it now at this point? Yeah, probably all thinking the same thing and that is probably oil and you are actually kind of right. Norway is one of the world's largest oil producers, but they actually have nothing to do with the other oil rich countries. I mean, just look at this picture. You can see the skylines of Riyadh. Saudi Arabia

Speaker 2:          03:00          conversation

Speaker 1:          03:03          looks like a Scifi city of the future. These skyscrapers, modern buildings and blends. You have lights. Now we'll take a look at this picture of Oslo, the capital of

Speaker 2:          03:13          Norway.

Speaker 1:          03:16          I probably see the difference right now. If you've been following visual politic for a long time, you already know that having oil is not the same as being rich. In fact, as you can see on this, Josh, Norwegian crude oil is twice as expensive to extract a Saudi

Speaker 1:          03:36          for a better understanding. Most of the Norwegian oil comes from the North Sea and these oil beds, if she had with other countries like the United Kingdom, however noise, taking the most advantage of that oil wealth. Oh, okay. Okay. And I know what you're probably thinking right now. Oh, this is another visual politic video where Simon tells us how wonderful it is and how rich Norway God by privatizing companies, right rice. Well, actually this time the story is different. Norway is actually a great example of state capitalism. So now you might be wondering, well, what exactly is state capitalism? Why is no way so rich and powerful? 11 answer the question, Simon, and what does it mean for a government to invest in the stock market? Well, do not worry because today we're going to answer these questions, but as always before we do that, let's have a look back at the history,

Speaker 1:          04:28          the Dutch disease. So I do need to be honest here because Norway is never exactly been a poor country, but it wasn't exactly always a wealthy one either. In the 19 fifties. Norwegians enjoyed a lifestyle similar to that of the French. This means wealthier than the Spaniards, but poorer than this Swedish neighbors. And of course the Americans. Back then, nobody expected Norway to have oil, but well, things change dramatically. Nineteen 59 and that moment shell started respecting in the North Sea shells in oil company. In the Netherlands, and they were looking for potential oil beds in the shores of that

Speaker 3:          05:02          country.

Speaker 1:          05:05          One day, boom. They found little gas sources and whenever that is gas and oil, so they kept up their exploration and this is how one of the biggest oil field in the world was discovered. An oilfield situated under British Norwegian waters. During the 19 sixties, Sharon got drilling licenses in those two countries years later in 1972, the Norwegian government founded its own oil company. Stat oil, fresh. You're married. Then you start on this. This is how the North Sea oil boom started. During the 19 seventies, money flew into this country. In just three years, Norwegians doubled their GDP per capita. All of a sudden the Norwegian dream and working in the dinosaur juice industry, I mean, who really wants to go fishing for salmon when you can make a lot of money working with and gas right now, it all might be sounding pretty fantastic to you. Rice. Well actually it's not. In fact this phenomenon, the. It has a name, they call it the Dutch disease or the cost of natural resources.

Speaker 1:          06:18          Basically anytime the country finds oil and its economy goes nuts, the government couldn't waste piles of money while still lowering taxes, citizens, they want to work in the oil industry because it's the most profitable. Well, what happens next few years you were coming in. Just one thing. Dinosaur, Jason, when you depend so much on a single product, a small change in the market price puts the whole country on the verge of bankruptcy. This is exactly what's happened in Venezuela and what could happen in other countries like Saudi Arabia or Bahrain, this. This was the big difference between Norway and the United Kingdom.

Speaker 1:          06:59          Both countries have labor governments, but their policies couldn't be more different. In the year 1976, the UK was in the middle of one of their worst financial crises. The government couldn't wait to squeeze that oil wealth for all. It was worth Norway. However, they had a more stable situation and they could wait so well. What does this mean? Well, first the government put very strict industry regulations in place. Plus, 50 percent of those are eggs had to be in the hands of the state owned oil company. On the other hand, foreign companies have to pay a 78 percent tax on the profits and that's not at all. No Way. Put a limit on oil production. Just look at ms dot. Yeah, yeah. You can see whether UK kickstarted that production. At the end of the 19 seventies, the British were already producing more than a million and a half barrels a day while Norway was still doing a third of that during the eighties during the Margaret Thatcher administration, the UK kept pumping oil like there was no tomorrow while Norway was still pretty much relaxed about the production. So what did they achieve by doing this? Norway was keeping the productive economy focused on oil, but just wait a minute because there's another big difference

Speaker 1:          08:11          you see during the eighties, Thatcher private domains to British Petroleum. Norway's governments by contrast kept control of start on even today, display the company changing its name from [inaudible] to Ecuador. That state still owns 67 percent of the fun. Okay, so now you might be thinking, well, oh my God, so wait, noise a socialist country, but just hold on a second because the Norwegian economic system, it's actually kind of similar to that of China and this is what experts are calling state capitalism. This means that the state controls a good share of the economy, but it behaves like a big private company. So what does that mean? Well, check this out. The hedge fund country. Now before we continue, I should make an aside here because this beautiful romantic and sweet melody or hearing right now is the music of end of it. A black metal band that's from not from Norway. They're actually from Columbia that it sounds just like a Norwegian bands and they sent us their music for this video. If you want to hear more of them, we haven't linked to their channel in the description,

Speaker 4:          09:14          the light.

Speaker 1:          09:21          All right, back to our stories. Do you remember the two pictures I showed you at the beginning of this video? Well, the countries like Saudi Arabia, they used their impressive or wealth to live like a hip hop artist on a Friday night. However, the different Norwegian administrations, both labor and conservative have measured every last penny they've spent. And so what does this mean? Well, that oil wealth and went into a piggy bank, and this is how we go to the year, 1990 in this year, Norwegian parliament, they realize three things. One, they have a lot of savings to all market prices go up and down and they cannot control that. And three, the best thing they can do is diversify their economy as well. How could they do that? Well, how about investing in the stock?

Speaker 4:          10:03          Gotcha.

Speaker 1:          10:09          I have. So as we say here, a visual politics. So it was that insert was done. This is how the government pension fund of Norway also known as the oil fund was created. This is a hedge fund controlled by the Norwegian Central Bank as they might be thinking, well, oh yeah, but what's so impressive about that, I mean there are other countries, but sovereign wealth funds China, there's Australia, there's the United Arab Emirates. And yes, that is true, but this is one of the biggest of them all. We're talking about more than a trillion American dollars. This means that if we divide up this fund by the entire Norwegian population, each citizen has more than $200,000 invested in stocks, but this is not the end of the story. According to the law, nobody can touch that money for any public spending. This means that the government can only use the benefits of the fund, but never the capital. And believe me, we are not talking about a small amount of money.

Speaker 4:          11:02          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:07          Norway's sovereign wealth fund made $130,000,000,000 in one year. Also, according to the law, they cannot invest in their local economy only in foreign companies. This is why today, Norway holds one point five percent of all of the stocks existing in the entire world. Now, of course, some years are better than others and according to many analysts, the management of the fund is overly conservative and it doesn't make as much money as they could, but the truth is, Norway doesn't just use this for diversification. They all fund is also a political weapon. Norway's 900, $5 billion dollar oil fund flexes its shareholder muscles, world's largest sovereign wealth fund, opposed 6,700 company resolutions. Last year, for example, every year the Norwegian central bank pushes a blacklist with companies that they don't invest in for ethical reasons. This includes weapons manufacturers, tobacco producers and firms involved in corruption scandals, but this is just the beginning.

Speaker 1:          12:10          You see, having stocks of a publicly traded company gives you the right to participate in the shareholder's meetings. You can vote on corporate decisions and even suggest topics for discussion. The more stocks you have, the more important you are in those meetings. Is an example. This past summer 2018, facebook started in new algorithms to filter fake news. They also started to take the wage gap seriously. These two decisions, all the outcome of a shareholder meeting and guess you added those topics in the meeting schedule. Well, yeah, it was. No Way. And the same also happens with other companies.

Speaker 1:          12:47          Norway's Fund backs activists bid at alphabet meeting. As you know, Alphabet is the conglomerate that owns Google and Youtube. A small group of shells is wanted google to refine the fake news filter and having the support of Norway's Fund helps them at win very crucial votes. The same thing happens with apple. In this case, Norway is the eighth biggest shareholder with more than 9 billion US dollars invested and they aren't exactly silent in the shareholder meetings in general, Norway is pushing some of the world's biggest companies to change their corporate policies on many different fronts. Of course, there's the gender gap that that's not the only one. Part of the Norwegian ideology focuses on this

Speaker 2:          13:25          two

Speaker 1:          13:31          Norway sovereign fund to focus on high executive pay. In many ways, big multinational executives make a big sign of aries despite the company losing money. We saw this several times during the financial crisis. As you can imagine, shareholders of these companies are not exactly happy with this, but it's hard to speak out when you only hold a small number of shares in the company, and this is where Norway comes in, is it's a loudspeaker for smaller investors, many countries trying to control the world within militaries, other countries trying to sway foreign governments with diplomacy. Norway expands their power through influence on the biggest global companies, and this is the Norwegian conspiracy, but meanwhile Norwegian citizens can sleep at night knowing that even if oil prices go down, they have their futures guaranteed,

Speaker 1:          14:21          and now it's your turn. Do you think it's a good idea for a whole country to invest in the stock market?
