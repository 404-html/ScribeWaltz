Speaker 1:          00:08          Which about a launch list, small countries which are more successful, these questions may seem silly, but if you are, I guarantee you they are not

Speaker 1:          00:18          well that is gaining more and more countries, so obviously countries, they are becoming smaller. Since 1950. Our wealth has gone from having about 60 countries to having more than 200. So this may lead to a few questions. I'll smaller countries, a good or a bad thing. Are they more viable in some way? While these are the questions that we're going to answer in this video, but first a quick comment when we're talking about small countries, so we need countries where the population of fewer than 10 million inhabitants, this includes Hong Kong and Macau because even though they are a part of China, they have their own laws, they have their own courts and customs, et Cetera. This is a law that grants its citizens' rights and freedoms that would be unimaginable in any other place in China with the exception of Macau, which was integrated into China following the same model. So having several of that, let's proceed to the key issue. What is happening with these small countries, and this is actually a really important issue in international politics, we all knew that a good deal of political conflicts have to do with precisely this with many territories wanting to declare themselves independent hands become new countries. Some examples are Scotland's Catalonia and go to start

Speaker 1:          01:25          in the small. There's no doubt here. Smaller countries don't usually play a large role in international news. They aren't really involved in major conflicts. They don't participate in major decision making processes and truthfully that political news is not usually that well known, but this is all pretty normal. We all know the presidents of the United States or France or Russia, who cares about the rules of countries like Ireland, Denmark or Taiwan. Yes. Now it's true on visual politic. We tend to talk about them, but it's not really that common out there in the room.

Speaker 2:          01:55          Real wealth,

Speaker 1:          02:00          despite all of this. The truth is that in the last 30 years, if something has characterized smaller countries, is that they do things a lot better than large countries. In fact, whenever ranking is published about the richest countries, the most innovative, most competitive, happiest, safest, all of these things, small countries almost always occupied most of the top positions. Hands, yeah. It's usually when we read these rankings that we kind of noticed there exist and we probably ask ourselves, well, I want to do. They do it. You see, if we take for example, the ranking of the richest countries in the world, that is the countries with the highest GDP per capita. We find this among the 10 richest countries. Nine of them are smaller countries by the way, out of those nine countries, eight half less than 6 million inhabitants. That is, they are much smaller than some cities like Dallas, Philadelphia, or Toronto. She's the top 25 countries. Things they change a bit, but not that much. Out of the top 25 richest countries in the world, 17, all small

Speaker 2:          03:09          countries

Speaker 1:          03:13          take price differences into account. That is if we take the GDP per capita pad with purchasing power, the fact, so even more shockingly one sided in that case, 14 of the richest territories in the welds are all talking about really, really different countries. There have a high population density like Singapore, others have a really low, unlike Finland's some also have more natural resources like Qatar and others have practically nothing like ours. Art more agricultural and others are more financial. Some are large and territory and others are not. That is to say there is an absolutely huge variety, but they all have one thing in common and that's very few in

Speaker 2:          04:06          who told you

Speaker 1:          04:07          about countries like Iceland, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Norway, Ireland, Denmark, Singapore, Austria, Switzerland and Finland. Here and in 2014 and 2015. Two studies published by the Credit Suisse research units corroborated this exact situation. He studies found that small countries tend to be richer and more egalitarian and more socially advanced. In fact, on average, they invest a lot more in things like their education

Speaker 2:          04:31          health.

Speaker 1:          04:33          That wasn't enough. Small countries tend to have more lawful accounts, have less debt, less deficits, and even fewer taxes. Even if we look at their financial markets or stock exchanges. For example, we will see it in the last decades. Smaller countries markets have performed the best. Have a look at this chart, so now I'm probably going to voice the question that all of you are thinking in your mind is right now on that swell. How on earth is this happening? Well to success,

Speaker 2:          05:13          yes.

Speaker 1:          05:13          Do small countries work better than large ones on big countries spaced out larger markets, more business opportunities, and a greater ability to take advantage of economies of scale. So what's failing here, and just before we get into it, I do want to say that I am excluding tax havens here because that's not really fat. Nivo. Finland's Austria, Denmark, or New Zealand for example, can be considered under any circumstances. Tax Haven. What is the explanation here? Well, as we usually say visual politic, that's never a single cause, but we can see that these countries, prosperity comes largely from that own weakness.

Speaker 2:          05:52          Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:52          You heard that right? So these small countries are involved in more international trade, not only sell, but also to buy the products they need a small country, obviously they can't produce everything they need. Also, they are more exposed to competition and the swings of the international financial market,

Speaker 2:          06:07          yes,

Speaker 1:          06:09          forces them to be more prudent with their accounts to keep themselves competitive kinds. Of course, since they can't afford them to avoid the implementation of protectionist policies. In fact, want to take a look at another data point seat 21 out of 25 of the most globalized countries. That is countries that are most open to the movements of goods people and capital our small country,

Speaker 2:          06:29          yes.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Own Hands. If we want to see how these countries economy and his company competitiveness work, we only need to take a look at, for example, the weld banks doing business index, which as you know, classifies countries based on that ease of doing business. The latest doing business 2018, which the World Bank published on October the 31st 2017 is also dominated by small countries. New Zealand, Singapore, Denmark, and Hong Kong. Occupied four of the top five places and among the top 25 countries in the world for doing business 16, a small countries and there's something even more important. See, small countries tend to have much less bureaucracy first because they don't need so many political structures or at least it's hard to justify them seconds because citizens tend to be more aware of the costs involved and third, because they simply can't. The role of this is that small countries, they tend to be more flexible, more competitive, and less bureaucratic. Before some of you might be thinking right now, well Simon couldn't small countries beat Richard because they were created enriched zones and Richard territory. Well, the honest truth of that is simply no

Speaker 2:          07:48          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:51          Of Islands, and there's the case of Singapore, for example, which just a few decades ago were quite poor countries and so on nowadays to have the richest countries in the world. Another good example is the old republic of

Speaker 2:          08:03          a vacuum.

Speaker 1:          08:07          Proof of separation. In 1993, Czechoslovakia decided to divide into two smaller countries, the Czech Republic and

Speaker 2:          08:16          the vacuum

Speaker 1:          08:18          that time both countries which used to form Czechoslovakia, suffered the effects of the Soviet Union's Fullan's underwent a severe transition. However, despite this the check side, we're still much richer than the slave act.

Speaker 2:          08:30          In fact

Speaker 1:          08:32          is the Vacchio. The park, as their income was only 65 percent of unemployment rates were almost five times higher, and the Slovak Republic, it depended too much on the money that came as interregional solidarity from the richest parts of the country. That is the

Speaker 2:          08:44          awesome, well

Speaker 1:          08:46          since they separated in 1993, both countries have done quite well. They successfully transitioned from a communist model to a capitalist model and have both grown considerably more than, for example, Germany. Now out of these two countries, the one that has progressed the most has been Slovakia. Yes, having to organize itself while having to compete actually favored the poorest. You can see the clear convergence that has occurred between both countries and the following crop. We'll explain everything about this in an upcoming video. We're done. We just want to have one last note here.

Speaker 2:          09:23          The new world configuration.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Globalization has led to countries with a large population no longer having the upper hand and it's not just that. The truth is that in this world, fostering traits such as competitiveness, openness and adaptability are becoming increasingly important and for the time being divvied small countries seem to be even more efficient at this and not just small countries, but even cities. Yeah, you heard me right there and I'll. Wells big cities have become the most important economic growth

Speaker 2:          09:51          drivers just includes

Speaker 1:          09:55          London, New York City, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau cities that playing an increasingly important role in our world. The economy of Jakarta, for example, grows twice as much as Indonesia as economy. New York's GDP is twice that of Sweden and the countries that have the highest percentage of the population living in cities tend to be richer. So that leaves me wondering, based on that information, shouldn't we all have that on smaller decentralized states for even give cities some measure of independence? I'll just leave that thought, right?

Speaker 2:          10:24          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:27          of course. None of this compares to the influence that the development of supernational organizations have to address from terrorism to caring for the environment, but now it's your turn.
