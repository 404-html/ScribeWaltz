Speaker 1:          00:14          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20          April, 2015 a historic meeting took place between Raul Castro, the president of Cuba, and Barack Obama.

Speaker 2:          00:30          It was celebrated in Panama and it was the first and bilateral meeting of the U S and Cuban and presidents in 50 years, four months, Ellia booth leaders and announced they would remake relations between the two governments. Today, the United States of America is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba. I'm dust. They said they would do. So it was done in just a short period of time that he first changes were made and relations between both countries started to returns and normal. Now he goes same like we see this a lot on this channel, but the arrival of Donald Trump to the White House, well, they changed everything again, the new presidents of the United States, there's ordered that the u s steps back from most of the changes that Obama initiated with Cuba. So the question might be, why is he doing this? What does he expect and what are the consequences of this new policy? We're going to look at all of these questions in this video, but before we do, let's have a quick little caps. The history of the relations between these two countries.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:30          The embargo,

Speaker 1:          01:32          often

Speaker 2:          01:32          the so called Cuban revolution took place against a Batista's dictatorship. The new governments in the islands led by Fidel Castro soon started to nationalize every kind of capital good and company Landon's, hotels, factories. Well, everything was up for grabs by the governments. So the Cuban revolution ended on the 1st of January, 1959 and already buying may, the government had begun a huge expropriations all across the country. Now our eyes, you might probably be able to imagine this is something that the u s did not really take very well. There were thousands of lawsuits filed in the u s which had close relations with Cuba at the time. Further, if this wasn't enough to upset the u s the Soviet Union was already getting on well with Fidel Castro

Speaker 3:          02:17          at this moment, when as a penalty, Washington passed the first trade embargo against the island and in embargo. That's slowly grew stronger as the relations between these countries were getting worse.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:30          Backed off to the missile crisis of 1962 at Kennedy, even limited to us, traveled to Cuba since then. Then with the exception of short periods of battery relations under the governments of Ford and Carter, the various governments of the United States of cabs of the embargo and the policy of isolating Cuba economically,

Speaker 1:          02:49          we'll move Reagan. Reagan

Speaker 2:          02:50          labeled the island as a sponsor of terrorism and later Bill Clinton made even more severe restrictions and the embargo was put into law. Since then, traveling to and investing in Cuba or doing business with the Cuban government has been very limited for America.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Wow.

Speaker 2:          03:07          That is until Barack Obama came to office

Speaker 3:          03:14          story 2008 fidel past power to his brother Raul Castro. That same year elections took place and Obama said it was time to use a different approach with Cuba. It was time to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Speaker 2:          03:29          Obama didn't want to wait and shortly after he arrived in the White House, he softens some of the restrictions that were in place on Cuba. For example, he allowed Cubans in the u s to send the money to the islands and he started to allow US citizens do travel to Cuba. Many more things followed these fast gestures. During the years, Obama was in office many restrictions against Cuba.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Yes.

Speaker 2:          03:53          December of that year, Raul Castro and Obama met in Panama. Significant progress was being made.

Speaker 4:          03:58          Well, I think what we have both concluded is that we can disagree, uh, with a spirit of respect and civility and that over time it is possible for us to turn the page and develop a new relationship between our two countries.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Anne's, that is how to greater moments took place in 2015 the embassy's reopens in both countries and in March of 2016 Air Force One lands then Havana for the first time in history,

Speaker 5:          04:38          Cuba,

Speaker 2:          04:38          I dunno, hosted a sitting American presidents since 1920 [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          04:42          Okay.

Speaker 4:          04:44          See of isolation designed for the Cold War made little sense in the 21st century. The embargo was only hurting the Cuban people. Instead of helping them, it's time to lift the embargo. It is time now for us to leave the past behind. It is time for us to look forward to the future together. When for Turo, they Esperanza

Speaker 2:          05:04          policies towards Cuba. We're taking over and even though the embargo laws were technically still enforced, the Obama administration managed to find legal loopholes to allow the relations between these two countries to be something close to normal. When Obama left the White House, Americans could travel freely to Cuban immigrants, could send unlimited money back to the country. American companies could invest in Cuba and even planes of American companies frequently landed at Jose Marti international airports because the new relationship, well, it was working, but then Donald Trump became president all over the United States. And as we already mentioned, everything changed

Speaker 1:          05:44          grump and Cuba.

Speaker 2:          05:49          On the 16th of June, 2017 trump decided to take this new policy back and he did so in a neighborhood of Miami called Little Havana effective. Immediately I am canceling the last administration's completely one sided deal with Cuba. As soon as he finished his speech, trump signed guidelines for his so called new policy with Cuba. But it's after any 50 year embargo with the country etiquette hardly be described as actually being new,

Speaker 3:          06:17          won't completely reverse Obama's policies. Many will be maintained, for example, the opening of embassies and the commercial flights between the two countries.

Speaker 2:          06:26          However, from now on trips of Americans to Cuba, we'll, we'll be limited does it, they won't be able to go individually and any relationship with gay Sunday holding grahib directed by the governments, which controls more than 50% of the Cuban economy will be forbidden. But don't think that trump has always had this hard line attitude towards Cuba. Quite the opposite. In fact, in 1998 he tried to build a hotel on the islands contradicting the embargo and did the beginning of 2016 he supported Obama's new policies towards the country. But here revision policy, we think that trump's out attitude towards Cuba. Well, it can be a mistake. So let's have a look at exactly why

Speaker 5:          07:06          trump's mistake.

Speaker 2:          07:09          Let's make one thing really clear right now. The embargo against Cuba has been eight total failure.

Speaker 5:          07:14          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          07:16          US embargo, which is blocked all trade and investment with Cuba for the past 55 years has not worked. It is failed to isolate. The Cuban government failed to regain any nationalized property and succeeded in giving an excuse to the Castro government for its abuses and economic mismanaged

Speaker 2:          07:33          more than 50 years. The embargo has been completely useless. It hasn't accomplished anything, and on top of that to the Cuban government has used it as an excuse to justify their poor economic situation. Wait just a second here because this is not the end of it. Not even close. Reversing Obama's policies is a mistake for several reasons. Importantly, improved relations with the u s of Menton better security for the United States. Obama signed several important cooperation agreements and since 2015 given authorities have given information on drug and human trafficking to the u s and it's, on the other hand, Russia and China have also set their eyes on the island.

Speaker 5:          08:10          The game.

Speaker 3:          08:13          Russia says it may reopen Soviet era, military bases,

Speaker 5:          08:16          Cuba

Speaker 2:          08:19          probably. Imagine what a belief in national security of the United States this would be. This is why making relations more difficult means nothing more than forcing the Cuban government to seek better relations with Moscow or Beijing. Not exactly a brilliant option for the u s and there is so much more. Trump's new policy will only damage to the interests of many American companies as well as put at risk, the major changes that are taking place on the islands.

Speaker 3:          08:49          How is Cuba changing

Speaker 2:          08:52          fins? Raul Castro came to power. He has admitted that Cuban a change of direction and that the Cuban model simply is not working. Some people were saying that he wants to emulate China, be open to the world that maintain control. The truth is that up until now changes have been scarce and slow, but even so, these changes could be felt and now the Venezuela can no longer help the islands. These changes have become more and more urgent. So now let's have a look at what's been happening since 2011 when reforms took place. Sims freelance entrepreneurship was made a lot easier since 2011 the number of self employed workers in Cuba is four times larger. It's Dave. The number exceeds half a million workers. The government has also allowed private farming for small farmers and restaurants and small tourism businesses growing and spreading across the country. The bottom is openness. Well, it certainly helps this process. For example, almost all private businesses in Cuba are working off money coming in from abroad. Abby and b already has 22,000 apartments, homes or rooms available in Cuba. Further, we shouldn't forget about less tangible things like the exchange of ideas, mutual knowledge, and the strengthening of the private sector.

Speaker 3:          10:05          Every dollar left in the hands of cab drivers, hotel workers, waitresses and valleys. It's a show of what awaits Cubans if they reject socialism, US Senator Rand Paul,

Speaker 2:          10:15          take a look at China and compare the country as it is today to the country. It was during Mao's time since the country opened itself up to the wells. Hundreds of millions of people have left poverty behinds. Yes, China like Cuba, it's still a terrible dictatorship is thanks to that open policy the Chinese have today more freedom as a better standard of living than they've ever had before. The short of the matter is that the embargo policy, while it's fails and trump's insistence in going back to this, is North's going to achieve anything that the weakening of security in the United States lead to further poverty in Cuba and prevent the changes that are happening on the islands. In February of 2018 at Castro was going to leave power, and this is not the moment for the u s to take a step

Speaker 5:          11:03          that's in order to

Speaker 2:          11:07          define his decision. And trump says he wants to defend human rights, which is nice. Don't you think it's a bit hypocritical to defend the Cuba's embargo while at the same time he hugs the leaders of Saudi Arabia? I mean a human rights not important,

Speaker 5:          11:20          less important.

Speaker 2:          11:24          10 Republicans have also criticized this course changed with Cuba

Speaker 3:          11:29          policy change that diminishes the ability of Americans to travel freely to Cuba is not in the best interests of the United States or the Cuban people. US Senator Jeff Flake.
