Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:06          I think the national media coverage of Venezuela increases. It seems as if they're national media coverage of their own country is actually decreasing. At the time we were preparing this video, we had a look at the website of Telesur, one of their largest state owned television networks. On the main page there, 29 headlines and just six of them were talking about their own country. Despite what this looks like on the face of things though, this couldn't actually resemble any better what is actually happening in Venezuela

Speaker 1:          00:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:37          there is no one who denies that the South American country is going through one of the worst humanitarian crises that the entire continent has ever seen. According to a study run by three universities from this country, the average Venezuelan ways between nine and 10 kilos less than two years ago when the food shortages began. Now the big question is how much blame should be apportioned to the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro? This is where people have rather difference opinion.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Too many political analysts, Venezuela is not a democratic nation anymore. Things like the president's attempt to dissolve the parliament or jailing politicians from the opposition have triggered the diplomatic crises at the highest level in at Adidas retires their ambassador in Venezuela with the support of their parliament. Nonetheless, there are others who still play in Venezuela is a democracy. They even seen Nicolas Maduro. The president's is defending himself from acute to tar. So the question is here, who is right? Can we say the Venezuela is a dictatorship or is there's something of an exaggeration they, we're going to answer this question, but before we do, let's check out the story of Nicolas Maduro. Bent is government

Speaker 2:          01:50          is preparing a coup d'etat according to Madurai. The Venezuelan crisis can be summarized as a conspiracy by the United States and that allies to destroy the Bolivarian Revolution and the so called 21st century socialism, they elite Imperioli, purest elite despises our people and have the goal of destroying our lifestyle, our democracy, our independence, and our homeland. They have decided to trigger plans to destabilize the Venezuelan society. Oh yeah, so there's an La, I know you're probably thinking, but let's just imagine for a quick amendment that that theory actually make some kind of sense. In this case, the imperialists delete. I'll not only trying to dismantle the Venezuelan economy, but also their governments, and this is what explains Nicolas Maduro is fear of a coop. But hold on for just a moment because before we continue, we should explain what acu actually means. Well, Acute Atar is defined as the taking of power in a sudden and violent action carried out by a powerful group like the army. And surprise, surprise, the Venezuelan army is absolutely loyal to Nicolas Maduro. Father of the Bolivarian Revolution, Hugo Chavez used to be a member of the military. Unlike other countries like the UK where it is forbidden by law for soldiers to run for office in Venezuela, there are several ministers that come from the armed forces air. We have left tenants, Melendez, revise the president's chief of staff or the General Marco Reavers, the Minister of foods. Actually one third of Maduro has governments comes from the military.

Speaker 1:          03:30          This

Speaker 2:          03:31          being said, who could successfully conduct a coup in Venezuela according to moderate? Well, as the amount of gas do you suggest is this would be his political opponents. There's only one problem with this theory though. Not one of them has any relationship whatsoever with the military. Yeah. People like on Enrique Katrina's or Leopoldo Lopez or any of the other opposition leaders are professional politicians or former businessmen and they have no military group supporting them. Despite all of this, the government keeps saying that all these politicians, all the real instigators of the country, street violence and live in a country where people need a full day's wages to get a bag of onions. It's absolutely normal that people would want to organize demonstrations. Oh, and to add to this, the fact that Caracas is the most violent city in all of Latin America, and as you'll probably understand why most of the protests send up like that. Yeah. Nonetheless, according to the government of Venezuela, the clashes between the police and the protestors are nothing but the outcome of bourgeoisie propaganda. This is why in September of 2015 three months before having parliamentary elections, the Venezuelan police arrested Leopoldo Lopez, one of the opposition leaders. The prosecutor claims that this man was inciting people into violence with these kinds of statements made on

Speaker 1:          04:57          what's that

Speaker 2:          04:59          guts to take me to prison? Are you waiting for orders from Havana? I'm telling you the truth is on our side,

Speaker 1:          05:12          but

Speaker 2:          05:12          the turning points would come later in December of 2015 at this time at Venezuela has parliamentary elections, and as you can imagine that the opposition party is unified in the so called Table of Democratic Unity, Aka the mud beats him do a rose party by over 2 million votes. The president's reaction was actually what you'd expect from every democratic leader. Recognize this outcome. Even if we don't like it, we accept it and we say that democracy and the constitution or the real winners here, hold on for just a moment because this is when the problem starts. This brands, new nt government parliament started trying to impeach the president and this is where all of a sudden, but during and his ministers made a radical shift. Economic war has influenced a big share of our population and this turned the public opinion. During this time, Nicolas and the dirt road tried to dissolve parliament according to his government.

Speaker 2:          06:13          Some of those mps had been elected by cheating in the electoral process and not even the supreme court in Venezuela excepted this version. This is why on May the first 2017 maduro made his final decision draw, calling up the constitutional power to get the piece. This republic needs to beat the fascist coup and let the people bring the harmony and the actual national dialogue. And otherwise my delray wants a new parliament and writing brands new constitution, which would give him unlimited power and this would be the ultimate step for creating a dictatorship. And does he might. Well now one's Ed. Is this going to be through an election? Well, theoretically, yes, but the truth is that since 2015 there are lots of opposition leaders behind bars. And so, well, what about the media? Badori supporters say that Venezuela has freedom of speech, but is this really true? Well, let's have a look at that. Their freedom of speech in Venezuela, according to the Curran's Venezuelan constitution, freedom of speech is a fundamental right. And yes, there are many newspapers who opposed then you've governments. But guess what the problem these newspapers have is, well they don't actually have any paper on which to print their new

Speaker 2:          07:41          just like that in Venezuela paper is a monopoly regulated by the state. And this is why gay media outlets like El now cnl, which is contrary to Maduro, has to reduce their circulation. And even the number of pages in their newspaper other day lease of had to become weeklies because they couldn't print so many papers. And now you might be wondering, well what about the incident? I mean who even reads print papers anymore? Well, unfortunately maduro and is governments have absolute power to block any website. Have you ever heard of the site? Basically this is a site where you could put the link for any page and it makes it shorter. So you can tweet it easily. Does it sound counterrevolution reading? Well, check this out. Leave shortcuts are banned in Venezuela. As you can imagine, if Britney is forbid, an other critical websites like CNN dollars a day or info bae up or say bands. If you live in Venezuela and you want to visit these websites, you must do it through a proxy. Just like in China. And of course, don't forget that there have been more than 40 journalists threatened by the government's allies or even worse,

Speaker 1:          08:43          six

Speaker 2:          08:44          twitter users are in jail in Venezuela for giving their political opinions. Yup. Yeah, that rights they on knots being judged or fines. They are in prison. But hold on for just minute because all of this is nothing compared to what's happening in television. And you got to call me for decades. Caracas was the Hollywood of South American soap operas. Venezuela was famous for having lots of private TV stations. And of course some of them were contrary to Madurai as governments. The Venezuelan Constitution provides for freedom of speech on tv, but on the other hands, the law of forces them to broadcast all of the president's speeches and we're not talking about one show a year. Maduro appears on TV several times a week and the TVS have to make a break matter their schedule and broadcast the presidential speech. Sometimes these speeches can last for hours and add to this other stories like this one. No bovie Xian, a Venezuelan TV broadcaster is sold to a new owner who promises a new, more moderate ideology. Before medallia was the president's during the times of Hugo Chavez glade, the vision was a diehard antigovernment TV station, but all of a sudden it was sold in 2013 in the new owners had close ties with the presidents. So the first thing they did when they took control of the company, it was to fire half of the staff and then no surprise, surprise and global vision became a centrist

Speaker 1:          10:10          station

Speaker 2:          10:14          making a mistake. This is merely one example. Today there is almost no media in Venezuela that is critical of the government. So the question I would now like to ask you is this, what exactly is the difference between Nicolas Maduro and any other dictator? Can anybody claim Venezuela is still really a democracy?
