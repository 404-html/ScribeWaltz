Speaker 1:          00:09          There's no secret the great us locomotive is working at full speed.

Speaker 2:          00:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23          Ten years of uninterrupted growth. The North American economy is enjoying a wonderful moments. You had employment rate lines below four percent is lowest level since the year 2000 and every month more than a 100,000 new jobs are created. Salaries are also growing, and then the last three years alone, almost 8 million jobs have been created. In addition, industrial production and exports are at historically high levels, even in spite of their last stumbled, the SNP 500 has exploded in recent years. The locomotive is absolutely soaring it, but hold on a second because the US economy has another face and it's a face we've already spoken about here on visual politic debut is the American economy, especially the government is addicted to credit and debt that right. You're saying September the 30th, 2018 marks the end of the federal government's budget. Yeah. And here's a question for you. Can you tell me how much the federal debt increased by in this year alone? Actually it's about $40,000 or what's your. The onset is no less than one point $3,000,000,000,000. This amount surpasses the entire Mexican GDP.

Speaker 3:          01:52          We are living on borrowed money, borrowed time, these hike interest rates, clobber exports, stumped, investment, killed jobs, undermine growth. She our kit and shrink our future. It's time to ask why it is that we have run up more debt in this country in the last eight years than we did in the previous 200 and to make sure it never happens again.

Speaker 2:          02:33          I'm

Speaker 1:          02:33          worried about the federal government here. The economy is growing, but the public deficit is out of control. By the way, just in the last year with Donald trump in the White House, government spending grew by seven percent and it looks like things are going to get worse, much worse. Congress' budget office estimates that if they stay on this path in less than 10 years, interest payments alone will cost the federal governments more than $900, billion dollars every single year. However, the federal government isn't the only debt junkie. Listen to this, the states, the hidden debt let me grow as an income in 2017. Thirty nine of the 50 states that make up the United States had surpluses. That is they made more money than they spent.

Speaker 2:          03:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Years of adjusting. Now, the question that many governors are asking themselves is, well, what's the best way to spend all of this money? And on top of that, since 2010, every state's collection has increased by 40 percent. So we're really not talking about just a few cents out. Finally, states have resources to invest in infrastructure, education, social services, etc. Then this might all sound pretty good rice. Well, sadly The truth is a little different. In fact, it's actually quite a lot different. You see, in principle, every state except for Vermont has to have a balanced budget. However, despite this and all the parents announced surpluses, the truth is that all of the states won't stop accumulating debt obligations and liabilities of all kinds. In fact, nowadays every stage drags according to the think tank. Truth and accounting. A heavy load of more than one point 5 trillion in unfunded debt is that the vast majority, no less than 40 of the 50 states, don't have the resources to face all of the commitments that they've gotten themselves into. Well, hold on a second. Yeah, because how the hell can states accumulate desk while their budgets are balanced? Well, basically by doing all kinds of accounting tricks after old politicians and elected officials are most interested in masking that figures and spending every penny. I mean if we're honest about it. This is kind of how elections are won.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Did they say they use many tricks from inflating income assumptions? do you delaying bill payments, but the most important trick of all is one that has to do with pensions and benefits for public employees when they retire.

Speaker 2:          05:12          Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:13          AlloW me to explain. In order to gain votes and get along with union state, governments tend to promise public employees very good pensions as well as lots of additional benefits of paul never time

Speaker 2:          05:22          right.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Given how the pension system works in the United States, this assumes that each month state governments have to contribute to the amounts they committed to to a pension fund, so there's tomorrow. all those public workers can collect the pensions that they were.

Speaker 2:          05:39          However,

Speaker 1:          05:40          just for a second, let's put ourselves in the place of the politicians in charge of the state government. What if instead of depositing all that money into a pension funds, we invest in all kinds of public spending programs. That way we can finance and lots of projects which will make us win lots of. Oops, okay, so some of you mIght now be thinking, in fact, all of you are probably thinking, well, what's going to happen to all of those employees when they start retiring and claiming those pensions and those benefits? The how are they going to be paid? And the answer is it doesn't really matter it. Remember you're a politician that's going to be someone else's problem way down the line. You just need to worry about winning the next election. Well, folks, according to the data it really looks like that is actually the thought that many state politicians have. Hat state and local governments made big commitments, particularly on pensions and retiree healthcare, but didn't adequately fund those liabilities. Mr. Brennan, a democrat and mayor of hartford in total only regarding unfunded state pensions, the state debts already exceed $800,000,000,000. The big question is knowing how the hell they're going to be able to cope with this huge amounts of debt, but of course not every state is the same, so listen up

Speaker 1:          06:54          best and worst. If we think about it for a moment, it's easY to understand. Politicians have a gigantic incentive to spend every last penny after all that entire future depends on the next election cycle. That's why it's so important. In fact, it's absolutely essential to not only have counterweights, but also for civil society to be attentive and very demanding. But let's go back to the case of the United States. As we've seen, they aren't dragging a colossal unfunded debt of one point $5,000,000,000,000. However, not every state is in the same situation. Out of the countries 50 states, at least 40, don't have enough assets today to face all of their obligations. Of course, though some states are better off than others. In any case, there are 10 states where politicians have been responsible enough to guarantee their state's future and keep their accounts in order. Well, these are the 10 states that really did their homework and we think they've earned the right to actually get a mention. It would be Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, South Dakota, Idaho, Tennessee, Nebraska, Oregon, and Iowa. As you can see, almost all of them, with the exception of Oregon and Iowa are strongly republican states and democrats should really start looking at it.

Speaker 2:          08:16          Yes.

Speaker 1:          08:21          The fact is that all the other states currently haVe a negative balance, of course, to get a better idea of what we're talking about. Let's take a look a the following graph. This shows the top five and bottom five states. Data is expressed in dollars per taxpayer and yep, you are looking at it right. While states such as North Dakota, Wyoming, and Iowa, I've been responsible and have accumulated enough savings to meet all of their obligations and even have surpluses to invest in benefit each state. Illinois, Connecticut, and New Jersey dragging a terrifying load of more than $58,000 per taxpayer. Of course, at this point, the question is, well, how enough, uh, all the states going to be able to cover their obligations. The answer isn't simple because the situation of some states as we saw in the case of Illinois, Connecticut and New Jersey is so bad, but finding a solution is really hard. Check this out. In new jesse's case, wHich is the worst off of all the states, the fiscal hold amounts to almost $200,000,000,000. That is to say this whole, which belongs to a state that has a little over 9 million inhabitants, is larger than the economy of Qatar and almost as big as the economies of countries like New Zealand or Peru. it's pretty damn crazy.

Speaker 1:          09:49          In any case, what we can say is that ultimately there are only two possible ways to solve this. Either they raise taxes or cut spending.

Speaker 1:          09:59          The problem is that raising taxes may not even be an option because it can damage the state's economic potential and drive away taxpayers, especially those who have large fortunes. That's precisely what happens in Connecticut where in recent years a lot of big businessmen have fled the state because of high taxes in comparison to other territories within the us, and it wasn't only Connecticut in 2016, the last year for which we have data. 600,000 people moved from the 25 states with the highest access to the 25 states with the lowest taxes and also donald trump's latest fiscal reform at really looks as if this process is going to speed up, but that's something we're going to talk about in a future video so far. You can see that the debt addiction is far from being an elusive federal government problem. The us economy is going strong, but this is the other side of the coin.

Speaker 1:          10:55          The truth is that for the country's growth to remain sustainable, both the federal government and the state governments need to finally start taking the whole deficits and public debt issue very seriously. It is not normal for a country with such a high amount of growth to have assumed many public accounting balances and this leads to big questions like what's going to happen when it all goes wrong and what's the limit to having so much debt? Because folks, let's not forget, sooner or later in one way or another, public debt always has to be paid. So I really hope you enjoyed this video.
