Speaker 1:          00:00          So somebody who is of this channel often ask us why we're the channel called visual politic. We make videos about companies, for example, we've already talked about Amazon into text and Tessa among many others. Well, we do this for two fundamental reasons. Now, if the first one is that we see politics in a broad sense, and this means that we can talk about politics without considering economic and social issues. Of course I day I think we can deny the huge influence that big companies play on our lives.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Second

Speaker 1:          00:28          only we know that many of you love these kinds of videos. So we keep making them and you know, well, we like these kinds of videos too. So here we are. So in this video we're gonna have a pretty interesting combination. We've got the company of BMW and the countries of Germany and China. As we mentioned here, a visual holistic Germany is the mother factory of the wells. It's the place where machines and the things that go into the other things that other countries produce, manufacture

Speaker 2:          01:01          shit.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Of course, of all of the industries, the automobile industry is without a doubt the most famous and also the most peculiar, we all know that brands like Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, Porsche, opal, and Audi are all jokes because Germany isn't any one of the largest copper producers in the wells. It is also considered the cradle of the first cop. Yes, you heard that right? Seen 85 a German engineer called Karl Benz trying to place a combustion engine into a three wheels. Chariots. This was known as the bend patent motor wagon atoms. It was able to reach an astounding seeing. You'd all 16 Colombo

Speaker 2:          01:43          does now

Speaker 1:          01:48          25 units were manufactured and in one of them, Bertha Benz, Cole's wife needs what is considered the first contract in history for a distance of actually 94 kilometers, which isn't bad. Now that something you might be thinking about right now, and that's the, well back then the were no petrol stations. So how exactly did Bertha Benz refuel? Well, she did this by buying a petroleum derivative in pharmacies called AESOP. That's right. We could say that pharmacies where the first gas stations in history, but of course that's not the reason why cars in Germany are quite so important.

Speaker 2:          02:23          See,

Speaker 1:          02:25          because more machines are always needed. The automotive industry to viewer is one of the most productive and most capitalized so well what better place to manufacture them than Germany, the country of machines. However, despite all of this, let's just say that in recent times the German automotive industry as the European automotive industry in general hasn't been the most popular danger of extinction. Yeah. In recent times that has been a widespread feeling that the traditional automotive industry, and especially as we said, European manufacturers will be the big losers of the upcoming electric car and autonomous car revenue.

Speaker 2:          03:06          You should

Speaker 1:          03:12          want one of those old companies when we have fresh and innovative companies like Tesla. Now this is something we've actually talked about on this channel not so long ago, despite never having made any money in producing very few cars, tesla has a market value for it is as large as that of BMW and which is far superior to companies such as Renno or Persia. So how is this possible? Well, as we saw basically because many investors consider this in a few years, Tesla will literally take over the markets. [inaudible] the viewer is where questions began to arise. We'll the electric car transition really be that quick. A European manufacturer is too late to join this resolution. Well, I don't know what you think, but some information at least does not seem to support these ideas. According to a recent study from the Ifo Institute, Europe owns almost half of all patents related to the electric car leading the world ranking and being well ahead of countries such as Japan, 23% and the United States 18% Yvonne Martin, president and Chief Investment Officer of my Guyana's value

Speaker 2:          04:21          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          04:28          Now let's assume that Elon musk is right and tesla managers to overcome all of the problems that currently affects it. For example, the production of the model three and thus fulfills his most ambitious forecast managing to sell 2 million cars in 2022 this means that he would have to multiply his production capacity and not to buy two or by five but by 20 in just over four years, one in that same year at least 110 million vehicles are expected to be produced in the world.

Speaker 2:          04:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:01          when we consider these strong growth of the middle class in emerging markets, I would actually be on a far greater vehicle production than that, but let's just be prudent and stick with that number. Out of those 110 million cost, no more than 20% are expected to be electric cars or even just plug in hybrids. So what exactly does that mean? Well, what it means is in the best case scenario for Tessa would have a market share in the industry of less than 2% and 9% in the electric car

Speaker 2:          05:27          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:37          We can say that the cards that not even dealt yet and so that even if Tesla's best forecasts on mass, then we'll still be many companies in the market. Companies such as BMW,

Speaker 2:          05:58          he ended up here

Speaker 1:          05:58          is one of the great icons in German industry, robust, luxurious, technologically advanced cars who doesn't want to be honest.

Speaker 2:          06:06          How about you?

Speaker 1:          06:12          In line of the past 10 years, this brand has been the world's leader in premium costs and the truth is that this is pretty interesting.

Speaker 2:          06:20          He,

Speaker 1:          06:21          this company besides owning bmw also owns mini and Rolls Royce and at the time of publishing this video has a market value that is very similar to that of Tesla at about 50 billion

Speaker 2:          06:31          donuts.

Speaker 1:          06:32          This both companies have many, many differences. While in 2016 Elon Musk's company managed to sell 76,000 cause while losing $770 million, the German company sold 2.3 6 million calls. And how they profit after tax of more than $7 billion.

Speaker 2:          06:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:54          All right, so now I know what many of you are probably thinking, wait a minute, Simon, this isn't a fair competition and Tesla is currently investing in research and the developing new technologies. What BMW makes the same cause they've been making forever. Well it isn't actually quite like that. Let me explain. In 2016 for example, the gem and grief invested more than $5 billion in research and development. Meanwhile, tests, his investment was funny of time, smaller, slightly less than $1 billion. And of course a lot of that BMW investment money is going to developing electric and autonomous models w to spend $237 million on battery cell center. And that's not all. Okay, so here's a question for you and please do not give a listen sheet. Which company, BMW or Tesla do you think is going to sell more electric cars in 2017 now, many of you are probably batting on Tesla right now by a lot,

Speaker 2:          07:52          right?

Speaker 1:          07:53          Well wait just a second because the truth is that taking both electric cars and the plug in hybrids into accounts, both companies are actually very close. Now. It does look like Tesla is going to win this race with a few weeks left in 2017 but it's seriously close. In fact, both companies are expected to close 2017 sales with approximately a hundred thousand electric cars. Salt, yes. Okay, so I'm sure some of you are going to argue, but Tesla has stored a lot of it's model three cars, which in principle translates into sales for the next few years. Model three will be new territory for CEO, Elon Musk and Tesla as a company. The sedan has already received at least 400,000 preorders. That is true, but the German brand also hopes to improve it. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:34          it's numbers in short, short,

Speaker 1:          08:42          as we always say here, a visual politic. The future is by definition I'm Satin Tesla. It could be a great company, but it's not going to be the only one. The truth is the by selling almost as many electric cars is Tesla by investing five times more in r and d and by owning a cumulative profit of more than $30 billion in the last five years, I think we can say that BMW is at least a very important competitor. In fact, it is surprising that both company's market value is practically the same considering that expectations for one so much higher than they offer the other. This is especially when we consider that in recent years, BMW has become a major and very important player in the Chinese market.

Speaker 2:          09:25          Okay,

Speaker 1:          09:25          great. Chinese market

Speaker 2:          09:29          since

Speaker 1:          09:30          2007 and despite the international economic crisis, the BMW group has managed in less than 10 years to increase the number of cars it's making from 1.5 million in 2007 to 2.3 7 million in 2016 and of course that translates into more income and also mop. BMW is nets benefits. That is the money that's left for the company after taxes has more than doubled in this period of time. Check out this graph, that graph, we could see that things have gone rather wealthy

Speaker 2:          10:10          company.

Speaker 1:          10:14          One of the pieces that has greatly aided this progress is actually China. Take a look at how the market has it. And then 16 I managed to sell half a million cars out of which 300 thousands were manufactured in China itself through a partnership with a local company and 200,000 were importers, mostly from factories that the company has in Germany.

Speaker 2:          10:42          Other way

Speaker 1:          10:44          it's one out of every four cars sold by the BMW group is already in China. Uh, markets where the automobile out will surge in the upcoming years along with its middle class. Well, the fact is the, beyond any comparison with Tesla, BMW is Chinese adventure shows us a couple of things. The first is that far from what is usually said, China could be a great source of opportunities and wealth. It's something which incidentally we've been mentioning all the visual politic for quite a lot

Speaker 2:          11:09          time. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:12          18 million Chinese people join the middle class and this has very clear, obvious consequences on their ability to Spanish. Secondly, it is very common to hear politicians of all backgrounds arguing, but in order to export more, the currency needs to be devalued. Well, Germany in fact, they say quite the opposite. What is required isn't a cheap currency. It's competitiveness and a good product.

Speaker 2:          11:38          Yup.

Speaker 1:          11:38          That is something we are going to talk about another time and now it's your turn. If you have to choose which company would you bet on? Would it be tesla or would it be bmw at the end of the day? As we've seen both having very similar market value.
