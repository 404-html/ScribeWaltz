Speaker 1:          00:07          Tom's approach towards Russia has been one of the most controversial parts of his short time in office so far. It seems that the US president wants to develop a new friendship with this old rival. The thing is that this isn't breathing so easy and that's because Beijing is standing between them, Russia who's in Moscow without any doubt. One of the most controversial issues is the fascination trump seems to have with Russia and its charismatic leader, Vladimir Putin, insinuations messages of support and the election of senior officials who were close to the Kremlin years met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin gave him the order of friendship and $2,000.

Speaker 2:          00:41          13, the new administration to where it is just being shaped right now. It is absolutely a gift for him. He couldn't have dreamed about anything like that just a few months ago.

Speaker 1:          00:50          The question really is, is trump trying to seduce the Russian leadership or as some are saying, is there something suspicious about this developing relationship? It would be fair to say that trump's approach to Russia could have an explanation according to some analysts, advisors in the White House may have told trump to try to be remembered and make history by being the leader who has the same success with Russia as Nixon and Kissinger had with Chinese

Speaker 2:          01:16          Nixon's had used his mouth China on the 20th,

Speaker 1:          01:20          first of February, 1972. One of the most important events in decades took place that day. Richard Nixon arrived in Beijing. It was the first ever visits you've communist China by a US

Speaker 2:          01:32          president

Speaker 1:          01:37          for Nixon on unknowns there for maintain. The entire trip was broadcast around the world and it was major, major news. Millions of people held their breaths as they saw Nixon descending the stairs of Air Force One and setting force in the Chinese capital city

Speaker 2:          01:54          generations in the years ahead. We'll look back and thank for this meeting that we have in this past week.

Speaker 1:          02:04          We continue. Let's actually go back at this and see what this visit really met. What were the goals of this visits and what made it possible. So we're going to travel back in time, but so you October the first 19, 49, this was the date that China was declared, I think People's Republic of China, the Communists led by now had one the Chinese civil war, and they took power of this new country. This new regime was completely hostile to Washington DC. In fact, only a year later trips of the Chinese army, you participated in the Korean War to support Pyongyang's regime, therefore confronting the US faced as a result of this better runs, violent fight, and did thousands of casualties on each side. There were no intentions of establishing any diplomatic relations. It would be fair to say that from that time on China in the US were enemies.

Speaker 2:          02:54          You have to move in this neighborhood.

Speaker 1:          03:00          In the meantime though, relations between Beijing and Moscow with very, very different. It is true that Mao had never goes on with the Soviet leaders who had, by the way, you supported other people to be the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. However, despite all of these differences, a Russian Chinese alliance was almost inevitable. On the one hand, the Soviet Union needed to control or at least influence the other grades, communist power. On the other hand, Mao's China desperately needed the USSR for economic, technological as well as military support. The support was so generous in fact that between the in 1954 in 1959, the Ussr spent seven percent of the government's resources assisting China. It's even say that this was the largest technological transfer in fight. All of this differences started to emerge in almost every part of their relationship and the alliance got weaker and weaker until well that completely broke apart relations. We're getting very census. There was the assault of the US embassy in Beijing in 1967, and then the first armed encounter took place in 1970 disease. When numerous during this fight, a few days later, the Soviet bombarded Chinese troops deployed in the area. The conflict didn't go any further, but for days there was a feeling in the air that this could be the start of a significant war. Moscow even considered sending troops from the Warsaw Pact countries which remain your objective

Speaker 2:          04:28          two,

Speaker 1:          04:30          so you said that's in order to prevent a potential nuclear attack by Russia. Nixon contacted Moscow to make it perfectly clear that the US would never accept something like that happening under any circumstances in the interrelations between these two. Communist nations broke down completely at the time that both Nixon and his famous national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, just only need to take a famous saying and make it their own one over my enemy is my friend, and once that said that they started to put it into action and two years later Nixon was in Beijing relations between the USA and China and moved on slowly. In fact, it wasn't until 1979 with Jimmy Carter in office that full relations with the nation were established, but the truth is that Nixon's trip to China made room for a period of successful relationships between the two nations. In 1972 bilateral trade between the two nations didn't even reach a billion dollars. Today the number is close to 600.

Speaker 2:          05:38          Really

Speaker 1:          05:41          things have been relatively friendly and the US also made a solid ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. According to some analysts. That's what trump is trying to achieve with Russia. The reenactment, Nixon and strategy for Beijing, Moscow. This would explain the pro Russian attitude of the current president's things are very much different now than they were in 1969

Speaker 3:          06:11          enrollments between China, Russia,

Speaker 1:          06:16          relations between China and Russia have started to improve since the end of the 19 eighties with some treaties and agreements being signed here and that, but it all changed when Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. Since then, relations have advanced quickly consider what was said in 2016 by one of the major players in the Chinese government's the profundity ends. The level of coordination between both countries has reached a level we have never seen before and it's. Beijing seems to be certain about one thing and alliance between China and Russia would be very powerful from any perspective today. Both countries are cooperating like they've never cooperated. Thousand and 16. Russia became the first Chinese oil supplier with oil that arrives by lands. This is something incredibly important for China because in the case of the conflict and the US would be unable to block the island writing something it could do if that's all it is, arriving by sea. Both countries have started to conduct a joint military exercises. They've also created economic and technological bonds end up agreeing to carry out projects to build infrastructure which will connect both countries. So how about some examples of this? Well, let's have a look at the military exercises.

Speaker 2:          07:38          Yes.

Speaker 3:          07:41          Russia and China. Have you gone eight days of naval drills in the South China Sea

Speaker 1:          07:45          seconds, those economic

Speaker 2:          07:47          bombs

Speaker 1:          07:53          infrastructure for this one, what better example than this? After 20 years of talks, construction has finally started on a bridge between China and

Speaker 2:          08:03          Russia

Speaker 1:          08:08          is more. These two countries have signed important military agreements, kind of has committed to spending billions of dollars to buy it. Some of the most modern equipment that the Russian army has, such as the s 400 surface to air missile ends, the most impressive weapon in the rationale. The sequoia at 35 fighter aircraft, just to have a look at this incredible

Speaker 2:          08:33          today.

Speaker 1:          08:37          There are also many economic political men's monetary agreements. All of this has led to quite a lot of concern in the United States.

Speaker 3:          08:48          Tiny Russian author just

Speaker 1:          08:52          sit there for just a second before you start to get scared because everything isn't quite as ideal as it sounds. Both powers may have come together, but there are still many elements that separate them. More mites potentially weaken this unity. For One, China wants to be important and influential in international politics and that's employees becoming the leader of Central Asia. This is something that Russia certainly doesn't want. In their view, the ex Soviet states in the region have to remain under the influence of Moscow. Further, there are issues concerning their economic relations. The trade is unbalanced in favor of Russia. Russia has become a supplier of natural resources to train. For the last few years, China has been supplying Russia with Chinese manufactured goods, which are more valuable. You see China's position towards international trade is very pragmatic. Chinese people want to make money so they know it's good for them to open their markets to the world. This is simply an idea that Russia doesn't, and then there was the issue with some of Russia's partners like India. Russia is the largest weapons supplier in India and and obviously Beijing doesn't like that at all,

Speaker 1:          09:58          so even though these two countries are trying to get closer and all supporting each other against the US, we shouldn't expect a very solid relationship between them after world. China is eventually going to make a play to become the leader in this relationship and to Russia isn't just going to lie down and accept that one. So you'd be honest. It doesn't seem very likely that reenacting Nixon's strategy is possible. This is largely because China is going to strongly oppose this relationship, but despite this, if trump wants to earn the trust of Moscow, he will have to make some concessions which would be difficult to accept in Washington.

Speaker 2:          10:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:38          Elimination of sanctions given you an on the Ukraine and Syria, the end of the anti missile shield among others. Susan is very demanding and even if a good relationship is established between Russia and the United States, it is not clear whether this alliance would be very effective as actually stopping China. This is one reason why Obama prefer to strategy of surrounding China by reaching agreements with the countries, neighbors, India, Vietnam, Malaysia, and in this strategy, the TPP was key. It was of course because it was one of the first things that trump flocks when he arrived in the White House or any time is going to be able to tell where the trump strategy is going to work out, but right now it's not looking very promising. So that's our opinion here. Visual politic, and we would love to know what you think. Do you think a Chinese Russian alliance, there's going to be consolidated against the USA. What do you think trump will succeed in a nixon like relationship with Moscow? Let us know in the comments below and if you did like this video, please do give it a like.
