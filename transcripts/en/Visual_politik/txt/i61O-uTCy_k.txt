Speaker 1:          00:00          When thinking about taxes you might think of country music Westons George Bush and a certain ranger will be aimless. However Texas is far more than these overused cliches. Frank.

Speaker 2:          00:15          In the last few years Texas has become one of the most important drivers of higher U.S. economy. And Texas is what we're going to be telling you about in this video.

Speaker 1:          00:33          With over 270000 square miles. Texas is 3 times the size of the entire United Kingdom. In addition to that Texas is one of the largest states in the U.S. In fact it is the second largest behind only Alaska. Texas is located in the southern region of the United States known as the Sun Belt. It has a coastline along the Gulf of Mexico and also borders Mexico itself. This border with Mexico stretches for over 1200 and 50 miles. The Lone Star State may strike some as a hostile wasteland but there is far more to it than that there are in fact four seasons.

Speaker 3:          01:11          The drought the flood the blizzard and the tornado season this harsh climate has not prevented Texas from becoming the 12th largest economy in the entire world. It is also the fastest growing state in the United States by population numbers.

Speaker 4:          01:29          It creates the most jobs in the United States and is responsible for the most exports. Since 2000 the population of Texas has increased by six million people which is more than any other states. An additional one point five million Americans have moved to Texas in search of a better future for many. Texas has become a place where you go when you're looking for a fresh start.

Speaker 1:          02:00          It's a popular place for people to go if they've lost their job in their states. According to data published by the U.S. Census five out of eight of the cities that grew the most in the United States in 2015 were in Texas.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Additionally 40 percent of the 27 million people who live in Texas are of Latino heritage. Furthermore it is estimated that by 2020 Hispanics will be the majority in the state. This will make Texas the world's second largest economic Hispanic power. This is only behind California which already has a majority Hispanic population.

Speaker 5:          02:43          Also the Republican candidate for governor Greg Abbott has released his first television ad and it's in Spanish and the 21st century.

Speaker 2:          02:51          Texas has led job creation in the United States in the last 16 years employment in Texas has tripled the national average in the same period. Texas has created a million more jobs than California a state which has 12 million more people. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in December 2007 Texas which represents about 8 percent of the U.S. population has been responsible for one out of every four jobs created in the country. So it's no surprise that unemployment is lower than the U.S. average and has been that way for the last ten years. Also in the same period Texas's GDP has enjoyed a 60 percent growth while the rest of the country has had to settle for 35 percent. Also as I was saying earlier it is the states that exports the most and 52 of the Fortune 500 largest companies are based in Texas. Having said all of this is no surprise that people consider Texas to be the true economic driver of the U.S..

Speaker 1:          03:57          Now it is true that Texas has suffered because of the fall in oil prices but many people believe that due to its increasingly diversified economy it will still lead the way in the United States. So you might be asking now what exactly is so special about Texas. Town planning regulations. For middle and low income workers the best part of Texas is the price of housing. These workers have access to big and affordable homes. This happens because regulation in the state is very flexible and it means that homes can be built but not much more than the cost of the labor and net component parts. Between 2001 and 2008 Harris County which includes Houston authorized the building of 200000 homes. This is compared to just 16000 in Santa Clarita in California which by the way includes Silicon Valley. A new houses being built every five acres in Texas. This is compared to one being build every 50 in California. This means that even if you make less money in Texas you'll probably be able to afford a better home. If you live in that state. University.

Speaker 2:          05:14          Texas has been able to develop one of the best university systems in the world even though it only has a population of 27 million people four of the world's top 100 universities all located in the state. For some perspective on Nasik country like Spain which has a far larger population it has no universities in the top 100. The education system in Texas not only creates high quality professionals but also attracts investments from a lot of companies. Texas. Regulations. On them all leaving. Texas is a state where salaries provide generally high in value because the cost of many things in Texas is lower than in other states. People also have more money in their parties because of the lower housing prices and the lower taxes in the state. The taxes are lower because Texas is one of only seven states that have new state level income tax as a reference point. The average family living in Texas compared to New York will save three thousand five hundred dollars per year in taxes. All Things Considered Texas is the fifth best state for getting the most from your salary. Besides this Texas is considered one of the states with the most freedom. It is ranked sic recording to the Fraser Institute. This means that it is significantly easier to do business in Texas than compared to some other states.

Speaker 2:          06:40          Further there are fewer regulations around jobs for example in Nevada Louisiana or Florida. The requirement to qualify as an interior designer is 2190 hours of work and you also have to take a course in taxes. There is no such requirement and anyone can go out and become an interior designer. As a result of this many millennials have been choosing Houston as a place to set up a business rather than more traditional choices like New York City or Boston. Many Americans are starting to think that other states could start to emulate Texas in some ways. Not only are there the tangible benefits of running a state in the way Texas does but there are also several cultural benefits. Texas's economic boom has attracted a great deal of cultural and ethnic diversity contributing to cities like Austin becoming a great place for musicians and other types of artist. Texas can teach us that it is possible to fight the negative effects of globalization as well as the automation of jobs by machines and they haven't done this by protecting their companies from foreign competition. They've done it by reducing the obstacles that companies and individuals face in the state.

Speaker 6:          07:46          Every week businesses lead Californians to escape high taxes and strangling regulations. They come to Texas because we keep taxes low.
