Speaker 2:          00:07          on the 1st of July of this year, very special anniversary. We celebrated 20 years has passed since Hong Kong stopped being part of the United Kingdom and returns to the People's Republic of China. But they did this under the model one country, two systems. As you know, although China is a dictatorship, Hong Kong was incorporated into the country as a special administrative region where the basic law applies. This is a law that grants the citizens of Hong Kong or a list of rights and liberties, which would be unthinkable in the rest of China, perhaps with the exception of Macau. Besides this, Hong Kong has its own currency, its own immigration policy as well as its own police, customs and courts. So in its everyday life, the country works almost as if it were an independent country. Just a minute here because I did say almost Beijing's interference has been getting more and more intense times. Don't think that Beijing is being discreet about it. Not at all. In fact, we already told you about it. Heroin, visual policy, how pro-democracy advocates have been tortured and killed. As an interesting aside. By the way, China has recently kidnapped five librarians in Hong Kong for spreading ideas against China's control of the city. So in order to celebrate this 20th anniversary, Xi Jinping made his first visit to Hong Kong. He is the president of China thereafter rule

Speaker 1:          01:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:26          see Jinping in Hong Kong.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:29          Changing things, visit. Was it loaded with symbolism since it has happened at a time when China has been receiving lots and lots of criticism about Hong Kong, this visit to view at lost it for three days and in this short period of time the Chinese president has decided to make things pretty clear

Speaker 3:          01:47          to, to endanger national sovereignty and security challenge. The power of the central government or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line and he's absolutely impermissible cgm pain,

Speaker 2:          02:03          in other words for Beijing. All that stuff about freedom of speech and democracy in Hong Kong has a lot of limits and as they are certainly not going to allow any activist or a politician to let things get out of hands and challenge Beijing's control in any

Speaker 1:          02:18          wait.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Well, Xi Jinping doesn't just want to let them go with a warning. Absolutely. Of trying to also use this visit to presided over the largest military march in the history of Hong Kong with Chinese troops. Of course, he also used this visit to attends the inaugural speech of Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong.

Speaker 1:          02:46          Aging Pink

Speaker 2:          02:47          is the Superior Authority and even the Basic Law clearly forbids him from meddling in local politics. He did take the opportunity to ask the new chief executive two things. First, he asked about the passing of an anti subversion law in order to convict all dissidence he data defend things, assumptions, democracy or independence for Hong Kong and seconds. The approval of a plan of patriotic education for the youth. Yep. You heard that right? And this is what happens in dictatorships. They like their kids to be educated about their obedience. To the regime. So as you can probably imagine, Hong Kong citizens, we're not particularly willing to do this. And on July the first 60,000 people demonstrated demanding more freedom and more democracy

Speaker 3:          03:32          urge the people of Hong Kong do not give up once we give up than we will for certain slowly deteriorate into what is becoming of China today. Avery, I'm the chairman of the League of Social Democrats.

Speaker 2:          03:44          This is what things are like in Hong Kong and here are visual politic. We're going to continue to pay close attention to the developing situation. So do not forget to subscribe if you haven't already. So now that this 20th anniversary has taken place, there are some questions that we can't help but ask, how did Hong Kong do in the last 20 years? Has It changed much then? Well, what is the current situation? Well, let's have a look at all of that.

Speaker 3:          04:12          Calm. Is Sill Hong Kong

Speaker 2:          04:17          best news off to these 20 years? Is that Hong Kong? Well, it's still simply is Hong Kong a city completely difference compared to the rest of China? Let me elaborate on that.

Speaker 1:          04:25          Swamp

Speaker 2:          04:31          Hong Kong, it's still the wealthiest and freest city in China. The course works and media are not under the control of censorship and political debates is vibrant. Vibrant is enough of the facts of the protests against China. They're quite frequent. In fact, a demonstration for freedom with more than 60,000 people against Tszujing things. Visits is a good example of this. Furthermore, during these years, economic growth has been an average of 3.3% every year and well this is a decent figure. Now it might not be as high as in some other Asian countries like Singapore or some non Asian countries like Ireland, but this is still higher than the growth rate of most rich countries. In fact, during this time that more than 1 million Chinese have moved to Hong Kong in search of it, that's a future. The city has also cemented his position as a leading global financial center.

Speaker 3:          05:21          The number of publicly listed companies on the exchange has increased three times since 1997 and market capitalization reached three point 2 trillion by 2016 that's equal to almost all of Germany's GDP.

Speaker 2:          05:34          I'll stay with 60 million tourists a year. Hong Kong has also become quite a power in the tourist sacks. Oh, hold on for just a second. Because the country is also showing symptoms which could indicate that the model is getting obsolete.

Speaker 1:          05:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          05:52          downfall of a single model.

Speaker 1:          05:56          It is

Speaker 2:          05:56          true that economic growth on this

Speaker 1:          05:57          island has been decent, but it's also true that it has slowed down with time for that savings of collapsed in the future. It just seems worse and not just for the political situation. This is probably the worst time in 20 years for Hong Kong. John's Hong, Choon wa former financial secretary of Hong Kong. There is an increasing feeling that Hong Kong hasn't succeeded in adapting to the modern economic environments or that there is a risk of them being a source of cheap tacky theme park for businessmen and tourists. It's like maybe it's the cities of the pell river delta where the lack of drawing from Hong Kong can really be better understood. This is the region which Hong Kong belongs to you and traditionally the city has been the center of attention today. This, it's just not the case anymore. I mean, take a look at Shen Zen for example. Yes,

Speaker 2:          06:44          Chinese city wasn't nothing but a poor fishing town of 50,000 inhabitants 50 years ago. Today the city is actually massive with a population of more than 15 million people. It also has as many companies in the fortune 500 as Hong Kong is an important high tech center, which holds many notable companies like Penn and

Speaker 2:          07:05          and now many believe that it is Shen Zen, not Hong Kong, who is destined to be the major player in the area and also considered this other stats. In 1997 Hong Kong represented 20% of the Chinese economy. Today that figure is less than 3% this illustrates, well just how much things are changing. Hong Kong's economy is stuck with remarkably little change to show for the past two decades. Simon cartlidge and the truth is no. If this has very little to do with luck Hong Kong, it has made a significant mistakes so well, the question might now be, well, one of the major one. Well these two, there are a great place to start. First there's the housing markets which has the hotel design.

Speaker 1:          07:44          Awesome

Speaker 2:          07:45          real estate prices in Hong Kong have gone through the ceiling. The prices have gone so crazy that most of its citizens knew that the only chance they have of getting a house is to get a public one and the odds of that happening, oh really, really low

Speaker 2:          07:59          antonoff houses available. All spaces become very expensive and this makes it complicated for startups and new companies to establish themselves in Hong Kong. This triggers crazy situations like this one Hong Kong parking space sells for record $664,300 and the problem here is not a lack of lands, not at all. In fact less than 25% of Hong Kong surface area is urbanized and there are other possibilities like using the seat plans. It's really not the issue. The Hong Kong, it has a very free economy but freest in the world according to the index of economic freedom. But it is not free when it comes to land housing and town planning in Hong Kong. The governments is the one in charge of the housing sector and it has become a complete failure in the last few decades. There are over 200 hectares of land available for building in the urban areas. The shortage of housing is real, but that is because of deliberate manipulation of the market by the government.

Speaker 2:          08:57          John White, a barrister and chairman of Friends of cycle pay close attention yet because housing developments have been frozen because of law from the colonial times for decades, the local government least farmer's land in order to grow rice. These communities support the government in Beijing and nobody wants to mess with them. It really is a totally crazy system and some people are suspicious band. They have good reasons to be. The government may have tried to go on a fever from some oligarchs with big real estate deals. Some convictions have actually shown this corruption and of confirms the suspicious links between government workers and the real estate magnets of Hong Kong. This might explain why seven of the 14 richest real estate investors off from home

Speaker 1:          09:40          calm.

Speaker 2:          09:43          This leads us on to another issue and that's the growing amount of crony capitalism.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:53          Uncertain people agree capitalism has lost its strength in the last years to a system with a similar name but a totally different essence and that system is crony capitalism. Under the British, the government was pro business but not of business. Since 1997 business interests have been baked into the political system. Conflicts of interest of multiplied cronyism has grown,

Speaker 1:          10:19          okay

Speaker 2:          10:20          in many sectors, competition has been replaced by well connected oligopolies and monopolies and the worst thing is that things are getting worse. It was trying to raise regaining its power in the city as an example of the liaison office, which is like the Chinese delegation, that is even giving out loans with better conditions to friendly companies in order to increase their influence and their political power and what to know what's required in order to get one of these loans well you need to have connections and some make all of this worse. This is all surrounded by the political conflict that we've already told you about. Anyway, it is carry lambs and mission to address all these problems. Her legitimacy is also questionable. After all, she wasn't elected by the citizens. She was elected by a group of people who are led by Beijing's directive.

Speaker 1:          11:08          It's fine.

Speaker 2:          11:09          There was this time of year when Hong Kong was thought to be the city on the hill for China's political change. Unfortunately, they things look quite different nowadays and the question becomes, what will the future of Hong Kong be like? Will it be in the light? What would it be in the shadows?
