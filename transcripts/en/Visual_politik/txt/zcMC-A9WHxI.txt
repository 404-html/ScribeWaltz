Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          It is the fifth most valuable company in the wells. Each minutes of the company brings in more than $250,000 it's income in 2016 was more than $136 billion and you know what's the best part is the company is only 23 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:30          this is to say according to our demographics there at visual politic, Amazon is probably younger than you. That was a time in history when the most powerful nations look to build huge empires. The British, the Spanish, the Romans, the Mongols. Today things are rather different though it seems that the great nations of years past to being substituted by new massive technology corporations. As an example of this, we have the Amazon App. When this it is not just a figure of speech. Let's imagine that you wanted to buy Amazon, which is now the unquestionable leader of the commerce. Have you got any idea how much you would have to pay for this company? Come on, just try and guess at it. Well, the actual figure is $420 billion as of the recording of this video, that's nearly half a trillion dollars, which is a truly incredible figure. This is because Amazon stock has tripled since 2015 which has made Amazon the unquestionable star of the market as this is not just a matter of numbers. It's also a matter of reality. I mean, who hasn't heard of Amazon? I'm as an is Dhea view the biggest ecommerce company in the wells, but oh, that is so much more. Did you know that it's also the world's leader in Web services?

Speaker 2:          01:57          I'm the still more than that. 24 hour delivery, ebooks, tablets, cloud services, and even trucks, planes and ships. Right now, while you're watching this video, Amazon is working out how to reduce their dependence on big logistics companies, notably with the company deciding to move into the shipping industry and a great deal of the company's success can be put down to its delivery time with some deliveries today, even happening on the same day as the order. Why don't we set everything as it does is in the online world, this is starting to

Speaker 3:          02:29          change the leaders of the company, especially the president and main shareholder. Jeff Bezos want to occupy the entire market and they've realized that sill more than 90% of all purchases are made in traditional brick and mortar shops.

Speaker 2:          02:45          What does it happen to? This potential of the company leaders have set the goal of revolutionizing commerce, not just ecommerce, but physical commerce. Well, this has already started.

Speaker 3:          02:54          Amazon already has several bookstores available in the United States and even about to open Amazon, go to the public, the first supermarket without cashiers

Speaker 2:          03:09          prized whether you should be. Because what Amazon is looking to do is dominate this market as well. And as well as Amazon is apt to do, they will keep on trying until they succeed. Up until now, most offline companies, both big, medium, and small have suffered because of online competition. So imagine what could happen if Amazon brings its competition to the physical. Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Marquez

Speaker 2:          03:31          not at all. Think of the consequences that can arise from the automation of jobs in this area, which is Bali. The way, one of the areas which employs the most people. All right, so it's still too soon to have the media concerns, but if you own a store or your work in one, maybe it's time to consider what's going to happen over the coming years.

Speaker 1:          03:47          Yes,

Speaker 3:          03:51          Amazon effect

Speaker 2:          03:53          recurring messages during Donald Trump's presidential campaign was the competition with countries like China or Mexico was making American industry disappear. That is why in order to protect and recover all of those jobs from seeks to put barriers against foreign trade, specifically targeting imports. The problem in here, folks, as we have already seen in previous visual politic videos, is that this doesn't really work. Now, it is true that 7 million jobs have been lost in American industry in the last decades, but it isn't because factories have disappeared. Not at all. In fact, industrial production in the U S is almost higher than it's ever been.

Speaker 1:          04:28          B,

Speaker 2:          04:32          there's so many jobs have been lost is not because of the closing of factories, but because of the new industrial reality. Factories need less workers due to automated systems like robots. All right? All right, so now you might be wondering why you're telling us all of this. Isn't this a video without Amazon and here we are hearing about Donald Trump? Well, yes it is. And here's why. It's relevance between the impact of ECOMMERCE, which is growing more and more popular plus this scenario of Amazon developing their automated supermarkets. It's easy to imagine how many companies will go bankrupt and the quantity of jobs that will be lost in this sector alone. But you know what? This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Oh, I mean it will be if we don't find a way to adapt, but if we do our own marked benefits as an example today, if there are more than 100,000 companies working with Amazon who earn more than $100,000 per year look bad

Speaker 1:          05:21          price,

Speaker 2:          05:24          as always, the majority of people in businesses are behind the times. We are simply not ready and prepared for the changes that are coming as without being ready and prepared. It will be almost impossible to adapt in time. But all of that said, let's take our focus back to Amazon and to a much more interesting subject, and that subject is money.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Okay,

Speaker 3:          05:47          gold mine

Speaker 1:          05:49          know. I knew

Speaker 2:          05:50          what you're thinking. If Amazon is so successful and it's worth more than $400 billion, it's got to be a gold mine. Right, and incredible money making machine. Well not exactly. At least for the time being. It is true. They're results are improving every year. Then 2016 when it was no exceptions, Amazon has submitted record results. The company has a surplus of two thousand three hundred and seventy one million dollars. That is a lot of money, isn't it? But the problem is that if we were to buy Amazon for that $400 billion in the company kept returning that amount of money every year or why they would take us almost 180 years to recoup our investment. So considering this, it doesn't actually sound like that great of an investment.

Speaker 2:          06:39          Well, just to know if a company makes money on us, like real money, I like to try something. It's a test and that test is to look at the amount of money, but it's really coming and going in the company. Well, in the last five years, Amazon has brought in a surplus of more than 15 point $5 billion. The numbers get better, but it's still relatively low compared to the purchase price of the company. So now you might be wondering what exactly is going on here? Why is Amazon worth quite so much? Well, you see, Jeff Bezos, the presidents of Amazon, has a strategy, invest all he can to reach new markets and improve the company's service. Consider this. In 2016 Amazon launched prime video to compete with Netflix and HBO. Well, this year Amazon is going to spend $4 billion on films and TV series. And other example is the so called project everest. In the next years, Amazon is going to invest billions of dollars in order to come to the market leader in.

Speaker 1:          07:33          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:36          In fact, it is said that the company is trying to open hundreds of shops in this country. So these are the reasons why the company is worth so much. Investors expect their business to take off in the next few years. Following this, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse to powerful investment banks expect Amazon to be the main character of the largest expansion in the history of business. How much are we really talking about here? Well, estimates are that in a few years, the income of Amazon will exceed $500 billion more than four times that of 2016 as well. Banks understand that, and that means money is going to continue flowing through Amazon's vein, new empire.

Speaker 1:          08:24          It's

Speaker 2:          08:24          like does that mean that Amazon is going to conquer the world? So to say? Now we have to admit that Amazon's success has been pretty overwhelming and their company couldn't really be doing much better. However, it's also important to remember that competition is everywhere. IBM, Microsoft, apple, Walmart, Alibaba. These vast companies are not going to merely be spectators here and let's consider the final company. We mentioned that Ali Baba for Queen of Chinese e commerce in China. Amazon has experienced a massive disappointment despite investing great deal of money. Amazon's market share is less than 1% and wait for more because the Chinese companies are going to be the talk of the town for all these reasons. Div some something that Amazon will become the Super Company if the 21st century and builds up to an embalmer that's on the country or this thing that it's a fantastic company but it's worth and expectations are a bit of a bubble based exaggeration for now though we can say for sure that there is one clear winner.

Speaker 2:          09:23          Jeff Bezos is now the world's second richest person. Bezos has a net worth of 75 point $6 billion. But one thing is for sure there is still a huge battle to be fought in this relatively new land known as the Internet. So that's our opinion here at visual politic. And now we would love to know what you think. Do you think Amazon will achieve its goal of taking over? Well, pretty much everything. Well it start making massive amounts of money or will the competition stop it?
