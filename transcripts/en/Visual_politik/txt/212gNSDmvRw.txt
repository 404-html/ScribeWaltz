Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          Lego is the biggest toy manufacturer on the planets, but nonetheless, they aren't even on the stock markets. Are there industry bm offs like Hasbro and Mattel are listed on the Nasdaq exchange, but lego with bigger sales have presence in most of the world's hands. One of the most valued brands keeps its status as a family business

Speaker 2:          00:30          and as we will see later, this is one of the secrets to their success, but not only vast, unlike a competitor's legging is the best 20 manufacturer when it comes to surviving crises. So now you're wondering, well, what Christ is exactly am I talking about? Well, of course that would be the toy crisis. Do you remember when you were a kid and maybe you wrote a list of things of what you wanted for Christmas, maybe you send it to Santa Claus or someone else, depending on where you're from. Well, what did you ask for for Christmas? I'm sure many of you wanted things like the playmobile pirate ship, a house for your Barbie doll, or perhaps those power rangers action figures that changed their heads when you pressed the button. But today kids have changed their tastes dramatically. Most of the things they want for Christmas these days. Video Games and I don't think anybody will be surprised if I say that the video game industry is absolutely on fire these days. Titles like call of duty and battlefield have a bigger budget than most Hollywood productions. However, the toy industry, well that's going the other way and this explains news like this.

Speaker 2:          01:33          R US filed for bankruptcy, but we'll keep stores open. Yes, Steve, you at the toy industry is set only in dire straits. Let's, there is an exception to this rule and as you might imagine that exception is Lego. Two years ago they beat their own sales records and they've been kicking us for the whole last decade, Christmas after Christmas. The question is how is Lego surviving the video game industry? Is Lego as good as it seems or are we maybe missing some details here? Well, today we are going to answer all of these questions, but before we do as usual, that's taken a look back at the history

Speaker 1:          02:15          family

Speaker 2:          02:16          business that go. He started out in a very small carpentry workshop in a village called billings in the middle of dinner.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Mark,

Speaker 2:          02:25          by that time, there were already some big 20 companies like Parker and the creators of blockbusters and like monopoly or the Ouija board. During this time Mr Christine's and was manufacturing all kinds of wood and products. But in 1932 he realized that specialization is the key to success with the health of his eight employees. He started manufacturing toys and only toys. Soon his product stood out for their quality. In fact, we could summarize it cause work philosophy with one

Speaker 1:          02:49          quite need. The

Speaker 2:          02:52          best is good enough. Or Kirk Kristiansen, founder of Lego, but the turning point for Lego came world war team. One day a British salesman appeared in this carpenter's workshop with a game changing product and this was of course plastic. This brand new material and our factories to create things in a cheap, precise and industrial way time. The new workshop manager was Mr Christine's son, son, a man named gottfried. He immediately realized the enormous potential of this new material and some years later and Lego licensed and now famous block assembly system thus ends with that. The most successful toy of all time was born. Yeah, controls that Lego are so intense that even the blocks that are sold today in 2017 can be assembled with the ones that were sold by manufacturers back in 1958 and the same applies to their corporate philosophy. If there is a characteristic of the Christians and the family, it's the they when that shooting,

Speaker 2:          03:53          here's an example before they started to produce thesis in Green, these fans more than 10 years conducting studies and discussions of the companies in the industry had no problem taking out loans to buy new factories and come up with new product lines, but Lego was one of a kind. They always tried to finance their expansion with their own profits and this explains why they had slower but more solid growth. Despite all of this, during the 70s and eighties Lego was on fire and their product is covered every stage of a child's development. This morning, a kid as well. They had deep play blocks with vivid colors and bigger blocks. After that, between five and 15 years old, you had the classic Lego pieces. I finally, for the teenagers, he wanted to improve their engineering skills. There was Lego technic, and let's be honest here, has anyone not played with any of those products

Speaker 3:          04:39          as if this was

Speaker 2:          04:40          not enough and they go had its own theme park, the famous Lego lands, these weren't another moneymaking machine. Hold on a minute because in the nineties things they went a little sour graphic crisis. The 1960s on known as the baby boom couples in Europe and America had lots and lots of babies and this meant the during the seventies and eighties there were enough kids to sustain the 20 manufacturing industry. Nonetheless, the 90s they were a totally different animal. All of a sudden families have less kid and as you can imagine, this was a bad thing for a company like Lego. Every year they sold less than the previous one and no matter how many fun parks they opened in the United States, profits kept getting lower and lower. These were bad times for Lego. I'm a Christian

Speaker 3:          05:29          family,

Speaker 2:          05:33          which makes toy plastic building blocks, expects to report a loss in 1998 it's the first since the 1930s during these years, the CEO is the founder's Godson, Cagelles Christianson. He was 57 years old and he had been leading the company for nine years. He saw how day off today his family business was getting towards bankruptcy. In that moment, he took one of the bravest and wisest decisions and can take. He stepped aside and let someone younger take charge. Y'All didn't, couldn't stop with just 36 when he took Lego's wheel. Not only that, he was the first CEO that came from outside of the Christian Center family. Nonetheless, this transition, he was a friend. Anyone performer in the new CEO worked alongside each other for years.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Okay,

Speaker 2:          06:22          good. [inaudible] would advise and Jorgen with the site and this new strategy. It was based on two pillars. Specialization as marketing. On the one hand, they go, got rid of everything that didn't contribute to what they did best. Manufacturing plastic blocks. The rest was totally extensible. They went from 7,000 workers to a little more than 3000 and Jorgen completely restructured the company. Up until then, the lego video games were created by a subsidiary called Lego interactive. You're getting sold that fat men started charging royalties to anyone who wanted to produce lego inspired video games, and the same is happening in other areas of business. Troubled Lego sells theme park. The other pillar was marketing. You're going to realize that his plastic blocks were wonderful, but they didn't really meet customers' needs. Of course, teachers and experts agreed that Lego was a really educational toy. It all kids to be creative and systematic. Yeah. Even rival companies recognize that Lego blocks were of a higher quality, but you guys about the opinion of a pedagogue or a rival company, you see when you have a toy manufacturing company, your consumers of the children, so maybe you remember how it was when you were a child. What did you do when you played with toys?

Speaker 2:          07:41          Made up stories. Of course, when it comes to the Lego blocks making stories, it isn't the first step. First you have to put all the pieces together so you can have the helicopter, you can have with the police, Scott, you can have with the police station. But once you have that, you just want to play. You want to make your own movie. But the hero against the bad guy, all of that good stuff. This is how lego realized that children needed characters, scenarios and stories. You see the old lego products, there was something like this. So yeah, we're a steam train, a pirate ship, a castle, a city. Not exactly at the most thrilling things ever. But after 2000 lego products went to the next level

Speaker 1:          08:22          lever

Speaker 2:          08:27          see an underwater city about to be destroyed by a giant octopus. So now here is the big question. Do you think is more exciting? A steam train or a giant optimists? Well, with this principal is how a new series was born from the Atlantis series to the now legendary bionicle. All of a sudden lego stopped selling plastic building blocks and started selling story

Speaker 3:          08:55          stories.

Speaker 2:          08:55          Good enough. And it's complex enough to inspire toys but also even video games and even movies. That new product strategy was based on three key questions. What your getting called the three moments of truth and a game one. What it's advertised. Does it make a child say, I want this too. Once he opens the box, does it make them go, I want more of,

Speaker 3:          09:19          yes,

Speaker 2:          09:22          one month later, does he come back to the toy, rebuild it and still play with it or does he put it on the shelf and forget about it, but also any of that, if kids like stories, why don't make toys about their favorite movies? This is how lego partnered with Lucas films to launch a collection based on Star Wars Lego of course the same. When's the Batman Lord of the rings and even Harry Potter? Virtually there is no movie the kids enjoy that has no lego licensed products and you can believe me, these things are at a blockbuster. There are hundreds of different makers of action figures and dolls whose corporate logos. Children are increasingly in different to Lego boasts, an estimated 85% share of the building block market. It's like, do you remember when I said Lego had sold all its subsidiary companies that didn't relate to manufacturing of plastic pieces? Well, that was true, but now they make a fortune with the royalties they charge to all of those. He made video games and movies about Lego and believe me, this has become an absolute money making machine. The lego movie premiered last Friday and made $69 million in its opening weekend, making it the largest debut of the year so

Speaker 3:          10:40          far.

Speaker 2:          10:44          This explains why while other toy companies are struggling to win the battle against video games, Lego is making record sales in all markets, including the USA. Big Opportunity here is Asia. This is a brand new untapped market ready to be opened. Companies like mattel or Hasbro are already compensating for their losses and America and Europe with sales in China,

Speaker 2:          11:13          like for Lego. This is a whole new challenge. This is why they're making changes at the company. Again, we aren't talking about a big challenge here in the last 15 years. Like it was multiplied best sales by five and they went from having 3000 workers to more than 19,000 nonetheless, you know from this video that Christine's in his philosophy is not about taking many risks, but in the last two years sales have declined to this or this and this. Now they want to conquer China as they want to have their accounting books healthier than ever. And this explains policies like this one lego predict growth in its China business but sheds 1400 jobs after a sales slump.

Speaker 1:          11:56          Okay,

Speaker 2:          11:57          so now that you know the story of Lego, the question really becomes, do you think lego can conquer the Chinese markets or do you think they're going to lose the battle? They're against video games? Well, please leave your answer in the comment section below. We love hearing from you.
