Speaker 1:          00:00          For decades, manufacturing companies dominated every largest company ranking on the planet because they weren't synonymous with success and economic power. Here is, for example, and I'm sure it's no surprise, China's huge economic takeoff in recent years. I take over. It has a lot to do with the manufacturing industry. Thanks to it. So far. In the 21st century, the Asian giants is multiplied its exports by 10 rising from just $257, billions more than two point $4,000,000,000,000.

Speaker 1:          00:35          That's why when we think about China, about the Chinese economy, it's very easy, the images of a smoke filled country full of huge dirty factories with thousands and thousands of workers making all kinds of junk for miserable salaries to come to mind and you know what? To be honest, when you first step into China for the first time, you realize that you probably weren't wrong. However, just because this is the China, we all know, but it's no longer the only China. Before we continue, I got a question for you. What would you say is the biggest video game company in the world? I'll listen up. We've talked about it in several videos. China is changing out full speed every year. Millions and millions of people leave poverty behind to become part of the middle class. However, today we're going to focus on a slightly different aspects on one of the sectors that's changing the most. Something that may be quite surprising to many of you. I'm talking about China's digital revolution. Yep. You heard that right? China, the country of cheap stuff is quickly becoming a technological giants, and the truth is that in terms of the digital terrain, in many ways it's even ahead of the western powers. Don't believe me. Well, let's take a look for example of what's happening with economy.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Just a decade ago, China's share and the global ecommerce market was less than one percent. Today, almost half 42 percent of all ECOMMERCE transactions on the planet come from China. To give you an idea of what this means, it's estimated that China's ecommerce market is already greater than those of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the U. s combined surprised. Well, you shouldn't be. China's digital economy is growing at four speeds, and I'm not exaggerating here. According to the China Academy of Information and communications technology, you have already agreed to it in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the digital economy, you could already account for 30 percent of the entire Chinese economy because it's not just about ecommerce. The number of Internet users in China exceeds 700 million people more than the Internet users in the European Union and the United States. Yeah, yeah. I know they have many more inhabitants and in fact the internet expansion rate is still lower in China than in Europe or the United States, but just think about that market sites that is used magnets years. All the 700 million people is a lot of people and yeah, it's true. You may have all heard about the great firewall with which the Chinese government sends us a lot of services and websites such as Google, facebook, or youtube

Speaker 2:          03:28          issue.

Speaker 1:          03:32          Yes. Unfortunately, that firewall does exist and yes, unfortunately the Chinese government exerts see huge amounts of censorship on the information that Chinese citizens can access, but despite this, the Internet is the Internet, so it's not all that surprising to realize that the use of vpn networks to bypass government control rates is not exactly low in China and besides everything that isn't, politics does kind of work with enough freedom. In fact, the Beijing government itself promotes the development of the Internet and digital economy as a national priority. Okay, so the truth is that the Chinese are very receptive, almost passionate about the new digital world. For example, in China, more than half of all events tickets are sold through digital channels. And what's more surprising, it's estimated that more than 45 percent of all retailers sell over the Internet. And other good example can be found in the fintech sector. That is financial technology services. So listen to them.

Speaker 2:          04:38          According

Speaker 1:          04:39          the consulting firm I research in 2016, mobile payments in China were worth about five point $5,000,000,000,000, approximately 50 times the United States, $112,000,000,000 market. Now, this isn't just about Fintech, not adult, the truth is that China has begun to play a part in almost every sector. It's very unlikely that in the upcoming years, many of the greatest digital and technological innovations will be born right here in China, but just a second because don't think that this is just some vision of the future. It's actually happening right now,

Speaker 1:          05:16          almost one in three Unicorns, which is what startups valued at more than a billion dollars on known as his Chinese one in three in the entire world. We're talking about more than 75 companies like the ones you're seeing on the screen now. Now you may not have heard of many of them, but actually now that I think about it, you probably haven't heard of most of them, but folks, they all have something in common. All of these companies are worth more than a billion American dollars and they're all Chinese. These companies are all expected to play a strong role in the world of technology.

Speaker 2:          05:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:48          To give you an idea of the type of company we're talking about, we'll mention the company on this list that most of you probably know. I'm about Dji, the world's leader in commercial drainages. Maybe you know the spark that now the care, the Mavic pro. Well, it's the company that makes those things along with them, of course, is the group of big players, Alibaba, tencent, Baidu, me, Huawei, et Cetera, et cetera. Yeah, we could say that silicon valley has a new and powerful. Right,

Speaker 1:          06:21          so allow me to repeat the question that I asked at the beginning of the video. What would you say is the biggest video game company in the world? Maybe a French company, maybe a company located in Silicon Valley? Nope, none of that. The largest video game company in the world is ten cent Nasoni non intended. Not Microsoft, but tencent. You see, even though the company's main business has nothing to do with video games, the company is best known for we chat. This company makes more than $16,000,000,000 worth of video games each year and controls more than 10 percent of the world wide video game industry.

Speaker 2:          06:53          Right.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Have you ever heard of League of Legends Clash Royale or candy crush? Well, to some extent they're controlled by this Chinese company surprised. Well, you shouldn't be. Perhaps the best example we can find. The digital and technological revolution that China is undergoing exists in what is already known as the Silicon Delta. Check this out the Pearl River Delta, the Pearl River Delta has become one of the most important economic poles on the planet here, and we can find some of the engines that explained the impressive growth of this region of the world has had in recent decades. Among others. The delta contains places like Hong Kong, Macau, Fascia and Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. While it's precisely Shen Zen's case that can explain what's happening in this part of the world. See, Shenzen is a city of more than 12 million people whose economy has just surpassed that of Hong Kong.

Speaker 2:          07:54          What

Speaker 1:          07:54          just three decades ago was no more than a fishing village has become a global technology epicenter. To give you an idea of what we're talking about every single year this city registers more international Peyton's than France or the United Kingdom. For example, ten cent was born here, the company that owns we chat, the leading messaging application in China and which you can do practically everything with in this application. You can even find real time thermal maps that show you how busy or shopping center is at that very moment. Just 30 years ago, this Pearl River, Delta megacity was a mere fishing village now home to up to 15 million people. It hopes to become a tech nirvana for the world's hardware startups. The fact is, this is 1979 when Shen Zen became the first special economic zone of China. The city's economy has grown as an annual average rate of around 22 percent today as development in growth are mainly led by digital and technology companies. It's companies like royal that aspires to become the world's leader in folding touchscreens. Something that's considered indispensable for the future of communications. Because folks, you can already see it and you China is emerging.

Speaker 1:          09:08          We're going to have to get used to more and more innovations coming from this country and of course that's a good thing. Silicon Valley needs some competition and that means that in the next few years, the pace of technological development will accelerate more and more. By the way, in a future video, we're actually going to have a long talk about Alibaba. Subscribe for Vat, but now it's your turn.
