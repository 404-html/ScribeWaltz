Speaker 1:          00:08          I've gotten a stone is a difficult country then many aspects, difficult honestly doesn't really cover it. I've gotten a stone is a very mountainous country. Almost three quarters of its surface is covered by mountains and peaks that in many cases exceed 20,000 feet. Cause then you can probably imagine just how difficult communications are among the different regions of this country as if this was not enough. It's also a landlocked and it's mostly Erin's place. In fact, deserts are not unusual at all in Afghanistan

Speaker 2:          00:33          stop.

Speaker 1:          00:38          So despite a few valleys, it's national landscape is mainly composed of red and yellow tones. But geography is not the worst part of this country and neither is a task. Climate conditions not at all. In fact, poverty, corruption and especially fundamentalism and violence, all the worst parts of this place. Afghanistan's if you are above all as a country.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:59          1978 the sour revolution, a communist space revolution took place when you're later in 1979 the Soviet army invaded the country to consolidate the communist government

Speaker 2:          01:15          since

Speaker 1:          01:16          send the people have not known what peace means, but before, to be honest, the situation, it wasn't really good either. Afghanistan was his ends probably will be for a long time, one of the poorest countries on earth. It's also got one of the hardest and most hostile living conditions, especially for women

Speaker 1:          01:34          countries. Six out of every 10 people don't know how to read or rice. Almost half of its population doesn't have access to drinking water and it's difficult to find a single family which hasn't been devastated by war and violence. We can safely say that if someone was able to choose where they were to be born, no one would ever choose Afghanistan. The last grade conflicts, which still persists to this day, it burst onto the global stage in October of 2001 when the president of the United States at the time, George W. Bush decided to invade. Afghanistan has a response to nine 11 at that time, Afghanistan was led by the Taliban, a radical religious political group, which protected members of al Qaeda, including a solid bin London

Speaker 4:          02:12          on my orders. The United States military has begun strikes against al Qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

Speaker 1:          02:23          The invasion, it was fast. The Taliban simply weren't an obstacle for the massive American war machine. 16 years and three presidents later though, and it has been named by many as the longest war in US history. It's already longer than the war in Vietnam. I believe it's on, not the u s that aren't winning that one.

Speaker 2:          02:45          What's happening? 16

Speaker 1:          02:48          long years of conflict, occupation and hundreds of billions of dollars later, and it would seem logical to think that the u s and NATO could have managed to have the situation under control and Afghanistan would be close to reaching peace, right? Well, nothing is further from reality. The truth is that with each day that goes by, the Taliban regain grounds. Just take a look at this map from the Washington Post. The colored areas are the ones controlled by the talent.

Speaker 2:          03:10          Bye.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Um, well this map shows the situation at the beginning of 2017 but today things are even worse because as we just said, the Taliban are regaining ground almost everyday day. Recent estimates show that the governments of cabal us and NATO control less than 60% of the territory and the next map is going to show him even more Taliban controlled and regions. Yes,

Speaker 3:          03:35          can government controls just 57% of its territory you s watchdog set,

Speaker 1:          03:39          but the loss of control by the Afghan government seems nuts. The U S it shouldn't be just seen as a territorial losses, but also an economic loss for example. It's really important that we ask ourselves, how can the Taliban, it finance their activity, where do all of their resources come from? Well, basically that would be from heroin production. As you might know, Afghanistan is the biggest opm produce it in the whales and this opm, well that's the raw ingredients that is used in heroin. And listen, Afghanistan is not just the world's biggest producer. It controls between 80 and 90% of opium production globally

Speaker 2:          04:13          believe

Speaker 3:          04:15          boom, comes from Papa Savas, some different, the most popular plant among the Afghan opium farm.

Speaker 2:          04:20          Sure

Speaker 3:          04:21          country. Most of the population lives off farm

Speaker 1:          04:25          say that most of the Afghan economy relies on two fields. That's international soldiers, opm. In fact, there's little more to their economy than that. So for quite a while, the Taliban have controls the opium production in this country, but now they also have realized that they can produce the heroin themselves, which is a much more profitable activity as well. That's exactly what they do.

Speaker 3:          04:46          Doing everything they harvest is duly processed inside the country. They received more revenue if they processed the opening before it has left the country. William Brownfield, US Assistant Secretary for drugs and law enforcement estimate is to show that the town of man could be raising about, yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:00          $3 billion every year from this. And that's despite all the money that the u s has wasted trying to stop these activities. And after this, as you can see from this chart, hasn't been at all. Despite all the efforts made by the u s opium production remains at very high levels. As a consequence of having all of these resources, the Taliban, they're managing, do you sustain a war that is not just allowing them to regain ground, but there's also plunged the country into violence and worst of all is that future predictions. They're not very good.

Speaker 3:          05:34          The Taliban are getting stronger. The government is on the retreat. They're losing ground to the Taliban day by day. Abdul Jabbar Carmen, I retired general. Listen to this.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Taliban army has increased from between 2000 to 10,000 soldiers in 2005 to more than 60,000 today. But at this point, the question was to become, why is the u s losing this war? Or at least why aren't they winning the Afghan trap?

Speaker 1:          06:07          The United States has tried many different strategies in Afghanistan, but it seems that nothing is working. In fact, generally speaking, this quite a lot of pessimism over this conflict. This is not just a matter of more or less soldiers. When Barack Obama was a candidate for president, he repeated all the time that Afghanistan was a war. They need to win. We did not finish the job against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We did not develop new capabilities to defeat a new enemy or launch a comprehensive strategy to dry up the terrorist base of support. We did not reaffirm our basic values or secure our homeland. It's time to turn the page. When I am president, we will wage war. That has to be what Barack Obama, when he enrolled me into the White House and he deployed 100,000 soldiers and another 40,000 from NATO. Even so nothing changed. Many experts say that.

Speaker 1:          06:52          The problem is that President Obama insisted all the time on an exit plan with a Pruett, withdrawal, a calendar, which is sort of like saying to the Taliban, hey look, you know, don't worry about any of this. It's all temporary. But beyond that, although the soldiers from the international coalition gains grounds, they couldn't gain influence. And now the question is, why is that? Well, first of all, we're talking about a tribal country with a culture of consolidated violence. It's not easy for international trips to gain people's trust and be able to distinguish civilians from enemies or even just know what's happening on the grounds. The cultural leave is absolutely huge and having suffered so many years of violence means that the Taliban, yeah, plenty of experience. On the other hand, there's the corruption and the lack of credibility in the local governments. We can safely say that the Afghan government has a total lack of institutions, which can provide anything to the Afghan people.

Speaker 1:          07:42          And while there are very few that do exist, they are extremely corrupt. In fact, this is one of the most corrupt countries on earth. Ordinary Afghans don't like the Taliban, but they disliked the Afghan government. Even more. People don't die for an army. They die for a country. And who wants to die for the current Afghan government? Dexter Filkins, New Yorker reporter. With all of this considered and also adding in the fear of the Taliban. It's easy to understand is why every month almost 4,000 soldiers and policemen desert to the government of qubole. Further, we have to say that the strategy, the u s is taken with the Afghan government, the politics and the institutions. It hasn't worked. Washington hasn't even made the Afghan military able to function with the exception of the special forces, which is formed of 17,000 elite soldiers. They are the only ones who are really fighting the Taliban.

Speaker 1:          08:28          Barack Obama understood that the war in Afghanistan with something that the Afghan people should carry out though the u s would be the one paying the bills. Today, I signed a historic agreement between the United States and Afghanistan that defines a new kind of relationship between our countries, a future in which Afghans are responsible for the security of their nation among all the problems. We also have two eyes in one Pakistan who was being accused of providing support to the Taliban and to an economy which doesn't work at all. And then there's three, a lot of concealed interests. For example, have you thought about what interests Beijing to Ron or Moscow having this war? One thing is clear, it's countries don't want Afghanistan to be an American colony because of all of this. After 16 years of war, the battle, it continues, but now that the oval office, there's a new president, Donald Trump,

Speaker 3:          09:23          a huge mistake.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Trump has been saying for years that the war in Afghanistan is a huge mistake and that the u s has to get out of that. He said it's of course three his favorite communication medium and that would be twitter. He repeated it to gain and the gain in 2011 2012 2013 all the way until his 2016 cameras

Speaker 3:          09:46          pain. When will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding Afghanistan? We must rebuild our country first. It's time to get out of Afghanistan. We're building roads in schools for people that hate us. It's not in our national interest. Do not allow our very stupid leaders to sign a deal that keeps us in Afghanistan through 2024 with all costs by USA. Make America Great. Now Obama is keeping our soldiers in Afghanistan for at least another year. He is losing two wars simultaneously

Speaker 1:          10:16          and it's not just twitter. Trump insisted again and again and again, but Afghanistan was a mistake. Have a look at this.

Speaker 5:          10:22          Afghanistan is a total and complete disaster. What are we doing? Get out of Afghanistan. We've wasted billions and billions of dollars and more importantly, thousands and thousands of lives

Speaker 1:          10:36          brands. Of course in the presidential campaign. He promised he will get the US out of Afghanistan if elected. Well, now that he's president as well, things they seem to be rather difference.

Speaker 3:          10:50          Trump's new position.

Speaker 2:          10:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:53          On the 21st of August in the military base of four to Meijer in Virginia, trump explained his brand new strategy as well. Let's just say that everything has been saying for years when it came to nothing trumps new strategy. It's so similar to a bombers that it's really quite difficult to differentiate them. Trump announced more troops but not that many more. Basically the contingents will increase from 12,000 to about 16,000 the training of the Afghan military and the fight against terrorism will become a priority. More money will be spent. Corruption will be battles and there will be more pressure on Pakistan. So in other words, more of the same and nothing that the US hasn't done before. The main differences from Obama's strategy though are twofold. First, there won't be a withdrawal calendar. I'm second from seems not to be interested in building Afghan institutions. In fact, with the budget cuts on the State Department's, trump seems to rely more on arms them on politics and it's not clear what trump tends to do with 16,000 soldiers that Obama couldn't do with 140 thousands how he thinks he can stabilize the country without solid and reliable institutions, which could gain local people's trust and allow for some economic development.

Speaker 1:          11:56          I mean, the average age in Afghanistan is around 18 years old, which is an incredibly young population and this youth nowadays can't work. It doesn't have any future apart from what the Taliban can offer them. If qubole or Washington or not able to build a framework of opportunities for these people, the end of violence will be very far away. So the question must be, it's Donald Trump aware of this.

Speaker 6:          12:17          It's going to be only America first America first, sorry,

Speaker 1:          12:25          16 years with an $800 billion in thousands and thousands of military and civilian losses later in the United States. It's still bogged down in what many call the Afghan trap. And the truth is that trump doesn't seem to propose anything difference without institutions. And with Al's a multilateral willingness, which must include Afghanistan's neighbors like China, it seems very hard to believe that weapons are going to be enough. And now it's your turn. What do you think the US should do in Afghanistan? It's a pretty big question.

Speaker 6:          13:06          thank you for watching. My original instinct was to pull out, and historically, I like following my instincts, but all my life, I've heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office. In other words, when you're president of the United States.
