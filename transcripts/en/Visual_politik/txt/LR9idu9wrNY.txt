Speaker 1:          00:07          Today we're going to talk about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The only country in the wells named quite say, ironically, you may know it's better as North Korea, it sounds democratic as they come through, ruled by the same family for 70 years, can be the head of state has been inherited through three generations of the Kim family and Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il ams. Now Kim Jong own ends in keeping with this publicly democratic tradition, the leader of North Korea is called not president or not king, but supremely supremely up. You know, just like any normal democracy.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So welcome. We really sat on North Korea that you haven't had before. Well, it is one of the most brutal dictatorships in the whole wells when mass torture, execution and extreme poverty are common. And now you might ask, well, why did we cast so much about this country? Well, the answer to that is as simple as nuclear bombs. This is a country that is still officially at war with South Korea and it makes a pastime of threatening Japan and the US with nuclear annihilation. And while that might have sounded farfetched at one point in time with nuclear tests happening almost every other year, people are starting to take a little old Kim, a bit more serious

Speaker 2:          01:21          sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:26          You still might wonder if North Korea is that dangerous? Well, why isn't anyone stopping them? Well, they actually tried basically every sanction you could think of hasn't been thrown at North Korea bus. Instead of that financial pressure forcing reform North Korea has just had it's diplomats selling meth out of their embassies well worldwide to shortlist there. Yes, indeed. That on North Korean embassies and two, yes indeed they were selling drugs out of them. But there's one country that still calls North Korea, uh, friends. And that country is China. They even have a treaty called the Sino, North Korea and mutual aid and cooperation. Friendship Treaty, China and North Korea are as close to each other as lips are two teeth, China. And to a lesser extent, Russia have been the only things propping up the North Korean regime. So that must give China a lot of sway over the Kim Jong Rights. While that's what the international community thought that south China came to be seen as the only country in the world could turn in order to reign in North Korea's nuclear ambitions as well, not so fast because things are changing in China is starting to get a rather annoyed at that little brothers Tom foolery.

Speaker 1:          02:42          So the question today is, what's behind the cooling relationship between China and North Korea and what consequences could this have on the future of the country? Joining us today to answer these questions is the biggest China expert on youtube. Yes. We are talking about Chris Chapple, the host of China or uncensored

Speaker 3:          03:00          Hello Simon and hello to all our friends at visual politic. So relationship between these two communists. Brothers have deteriorated so much in China and North Korea are in the middle of a war of work. Basically China said that it would work with the evil imperialists. You know the US do combat North Korea's nuclear program. Then North Korean state run media responded that China should really think about how it's reckless act of chopping down the pillar of North Korea. China relations could have grave consequences. And then Johnny state run media responded with a not so subtle threat to end their alliance.

Speaker 1:          03:38          So why is that the. Are they stabbing each other in the back? But we're going to have a look at that right now. China North Korea showing that ends up North Korea really make the perfect best friends. They have much in common. They share a border. They both had communist uprisings, ams, they have installed leaders who have radical views of Marxism. The People's Republic of China, ends of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Really all like the Quintin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez on international politics. Especially like if you're doing a movie or something. Doing it with Robert is just the idea that that's a year I get to hang out with Robert. Now

Speaker 3:          04:14          China does more than just give North Korea financial aid. Jen has also made big loans of the North Korean regime so they can build railroads and highways and they're pretty forgiving when p young can't pay back its debt. And then there's oil. For decades, China was the main source of dino juice to North Korea. There's military

Speaker 2:          04:34          great

Speaker 1:          04:38          help train North Korean hackers, hackers who've now become a threat to the international community, including China. What does Beijing get in exchange? Well, North Korea is a cheap labor paradise. In fact, in many products with the made in China, labels should actually say, made in DPR.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:59          brilliant sportswear brand. Rip Curl made a public apology this week afterward emerged that some of it's skier had been made in one of North Korea. Stayed on factor, but hold on a minute because things are starting to change. The Chinese Communist Party today is a little less interested in the global spread of communism and then there's one more interested in becoming a global superpower. North Korea is well, very rarely cramping China's style. Imagine how hard it is to be cool with America when you're good. Buddy North Korea keeps threatening to blow them up, but this is the end of the story. Sixty years ago, China and North Korea were pretty similar, but today things are quite different.

Speaker 4:          05:40          Terrorists came to see closely is the misery experienced by the North Korean neighbors. I'm not old, but I feel like what I can see over there is similar to the very difficult time that our nation had in the past,

Speaker 1:          05:52          a loss of North Korean citizens would do whatever it takes in order to cross the Chinese borden and Beijing is scared of what could become a refugee crisis similar to that of Syria.

Speaker 3:          06:03          If this wasn't enough, Pyongyang's diplomacy hasn't been all that diplomatic with its own allies. Here's a little snub courtesy of Kim Jong Un in 2015

Speaker 5:          06:18          in all female North Korean pop band formed by leader Kim Jong Un abruptly canceled a Beijing concert on Saturday and headed back home to Pyongyang,

Speaker 1:          06:33          but unfortunately it February 2017 became the breaking points for this friendship.

Speaker 3:          06:37          North Korea launching some ballistic missiles or conducting some nuclear tests is nothing new, but what is do is the degree to which China is willing to criticize it. This is happening at a time when Chinese leader Xi Jingping is trying to improve his relationship with the United States and of course, according to young. This is a stab in the back, triggered the war of words between these two countries with state run media in both countries criticizing the other,

Speaker 1:          07:08          but again, this is not the end of the story. Remember those Chinese trains? North Korean hackers, there's allegedly hit several Hollywood studios two years ago. Well, if you lay down with dogs, don't be surprised if you wake up with fleas

Speaker 5:          07:24          called ransomware attacks that began Friday. Have struck China hard. If North Korea is responsible, even unintentionally, it wouldn't be the first known attempt by Pyong Young to digitally Pilfer China's coffers at such a scale.

Speaker 1:          07:36          In other words, buying, keeping things the same. North Korea is about to lose their biggest ally, the only country willing to defend them in case of war. This is a war even if just for propaganda reasons. A lot of people would love to start.

Speaker 6:          07:50          Hey,

Speaker 1:          07:55          trump, come in. I know what you're thinking. Oh, Simon, this. This is quite a story and need some needs to become a true visual politic video. So well,

Speaker 6:          08:05          no.

Speaker 5:          08:09          Russia has already taken over the supply of jet fuel to North Korea after China halted exports two years ago. According to the industry sources in China,

Speaker 3:          08:16          Russia and North Korea also have a lot of things in common apart from sharing a border. They both have strong, attractive and manly lead. Both countries. Human rights are considered optional. Russia and North Korea just started a ferry service that connects their two countries to Russian companies can be regularly stock with a North Korean slave workforce. Does that mean Putin and Kim are now besties? Well, so fast

Speaker 1:          08:45          because Kim Jong Un has a rather funny concept of truth.

Speaker 2:          08:49          No,

Speaker 5:          08:52          rhea launches a missile near Russians.

Speaker 1:          08:56          Alright, listen, Kim Jong Un dude. This is really not the way you made friends and as you might imagine with things like this, Russia may not be too big to become a north. Korea is unconditional allied and so for the first time in its history, the most hated country. It has run out of allies and this is where donald trump's steps into the vic trap.

Speaker 3:          09:15          We have a big problem. We have somebody that is not doing the right thing, and that's going to be my responsibility.

Speaker 1:          09:22          This comes at a time when China is trying to work on a new trade deal with the United States at the same time that Donald trump is facing a lot of pressure.

Speaker 7:          09:30          Hi.

Speaker 1:          09:32          So the question is now, will Donald Trump be taking responsibility for North Korea to improve his image in the United States? Could this be the end of the North Korean dictatorship? Well, you can leave us your thoughts in the comments section below. We'd love to hear from you.
