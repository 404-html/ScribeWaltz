Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          so a few weeks ago, I told you the story of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 and all the problems that they're facing, any of the Olympic Games are one of the most expensive events that a city can host. Nonetheless, usually city hauls go crazy to get a chance to organize the limbics. Usually they always have the support of their national governments and their citizens. In fact, each time they'd make a survey, most of the people are happy about hosting the Olympic Games. The main opinion is that's an event. It's lengthy. Olympics brings a lot of good into the country. It increases tourism. The host city gets renovators and the country becomes fashionable attracting investors and businessmen from all over the world. Well, if you've seen our video about Tokyo, you know that this isn't exactly true. In fact, the Olympics can create big problems in Japan, might end up going bankrupt from going so far over budget. In fact, we can say that is a big debate about whether it's goods or bad. It's a host, the Olympic Games, and guess what? The Olympic excitements is not exactly having its best hour until 2012 each time the International Olympic Committee met to choose the next host city. There were around five candidates. However, the 2024 games had just two candidates, Los Angeles and Paris.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:36          Many capitals like boot of hash or Rome retired their bid at the last minute and others like Hamburg and Germany organize a referendum or citizens voted against hosting the Olympics. Yes, you heard that right? There is the general disappointments about the Olympics and this might be a big problem for the International Olympic Committee if nobody wants to host. I mean what could happen to the future of the Olympic Games and the bigger question of course is, well, is this the end of the Olympics spirits? So what could we do to keep the Olympic flame burning? Well, today we're going to answer those questions, but before we do that is take a look back at the history.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Great.

Speaker 2:          02:16          Vic Breakfast. I'm sure that every one of you knows that the Olympic Games work she did in ancient Greece, but the truth is that the muzzle Olympics has nothing to do with Mount Olympus. It really started in the 1896 with a French born baron named Pierre to cook a tall, along with a Greek man named evangelist Zapper. They convince the Greek government to organize some games the same way that the ancient Greeks sat back then, nationalism was high in Greece, so everything that helps to inflame the national pride was seen as a good idea by the government. This is how the first modern Olympics we're organized in Athens. Nonetheless, he had to keep, it all had bigger plans than simple nationalist propaganda. This could be an international events.

Speaker 2:          03:01          What's in order to achieve this? The host city had to rotate. This is how the International Olympic Committee also known as I oh c was born. The IOC is an organization responsible for ensuring that every four years we have the winter Olympics, the summer Olympics, and the Paralympics. Put it another way. This committee's mission is to promote sports and tolerance among nations. And this was a pretty wonderful idea, but do hold on for just a second because we are just getting started with our story. The first Olympic Games were pretty modest events that were organized next to international exhibitions, but things really changed in the year 1936

Speaker 1:          03:42          okay.

Speaker 2:          03:45          As you know, back then, Nazi Germany, well, they were about to start their world conquest to this end is they needed to improve that image abroad and is the idea of wrapping themselves with the flag of sports excellence and tolerance between nations sounded like heaven to the ears of adult headlock and this is why the Bellin Olympic Games in 1936 became the first Olympic super reduction in history. It cost more than 30 million US dollars at the time, and that was an insane amount of money back in the day. The precedent for hosted cities overspending on the Olympic Games while it all came from Nazi Germany.

Speaker 1:          04:26          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:29          But the first big economic catastrophe, well that came many years later with the Montreal Olympics in 1976

Speaker 3:          04:37          those games ended up costing eight times more than the initial budget and they had lasting financial consequences. Canada didn't finish paying the debt in incurred to finance those games until 2006 they even had to create a new special tax for tobacco in order to cover the costs.

Speaker 2:          04:57          I'm the story here. It's really simple. I mean there were lots of cities who want to host the Olympics, but first they need to be chosen by the IOC. And as you can imagine, the more you are willing to spend, the higher your chances of winning the bid. And listen, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. Why is money that's important to the International Olympic Committee? Do you know what I mean? Didn't we just say that what matters here is the tolerance, the excellence and the sports. Well, yeah, you are right, but the budget is not the only element that the IOC takes into account when it chooses a host sissy. There are plenty of other factors that they need to keep in mind.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Okay.

Speaker 3:          05:37          Bribery scandal threatens to shrink 2002 Winter Games,

Speaker 2:          05:42          man, that is just one example. According to the AISC manual, each time they visit one candidate city, the town hall must pay for a four or five star hotel and international breakfast and luxury private cars for each of their members. And yes, this is actually specified in the guidelines and listen, according to recent investigations, the parties that are held to entertain the IOC members would pretty much make Berlusconi's orgies look like Sunday mass. All right, so you might think that with that last statement, I'm exaggerating a little, but really I, I

Speaker 1:          06:12          no

Speaker 3:          06:18          to IOC members accepted offers of prostitution from the Amsterdam Committee that bid for the 1992 summer games.

Speaker 2:          06:27          As you can see, it's not like the IOC members live like rockstars. Indeed, I would say that rock stars who wished they lived like IOC members. Well, do you know what the best parts of all of this as well, their organization makes millions of dollars every year, but they aren't even registered as a company. The IOC is technically a nonprofit organization headquartered in Switzerland. All right, so what does that actually mean? Well, essentially it means that they don't need to pay taxes and they can use all kinds of strategies. Do you honey their accounting book? Well, it essentially means that they don't need to pay taxes and they can use all kinds of strategies. Do you hype their accounting books?

Speaker 1:          07:07          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:07          Now you may remember that we previously did a video about e sports where we talked about Formula One Formula One. While that's a publicly traded company, and that's why on visual politic we could give you accurate numbers for how much money they make. With the Olympics. It's far, far more difficult. You can make estimations based on how much they charge for the broadcasting rights are. That's, that's pretty much it. So now you may be wondering, why am I sticking quite so much on how much money the IOC actually makes look vast? Because when somebody has a good income and almost no spending, I mean don't forget that the Games are pretty much paid almost entirely by local governments. Well. Then you can invest in things like this.

Speaker 3:          07:49          Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization. For example, political advertising, religious or public relations to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants.

Speaker 2:          08:05          In other words, you can pay for things like the Olympic studies centers, which have a presence in several universities all around the globe. That job is basically to produce academic research to prove with scientific research and data that hosting the Olympics is as good as winning the lottery. But listen, this is not the end of the story here. I told you some of the reasons why a city is chosen to host the Olympic, but this is still not the end of our story today. I told you some of the reasons previously why a city would be chosen to host the Olympics. Well, another one is what they call the Olympic feeling among the citizens. This means how much people in the city or country are actually in favor of hosting the Games. So if you're watching this video from London, you probably have some idea of what I'm talking about. I mean, all of a sudden the local media is talking about it, your friends, but the Olympic logo on their facebook profile picture, and it's almost impossible. Find critics on any talk show.

Speaker 2:          09:01          I mean, it's really in the interest of the entire governments and the sponsors to silence all of the discordant voices. So this is probably why this happens. And then, I mean, what's the conclusion we can draw from all of this? Well, in a city like Madrid, more than 85% of citizens wanted the Olympic Games according to a survey. And a similar thing happens in Tokyo and in pretty much any other host city. So all of this explains partly the rush to organize the Olympics that pretty much any cost. Japan has already announced that they were spending over 20 billion United States dollars for that Tokyo Olympics in 2020 Rio de Janeiro in 2012 costs more than $12 billion for the Brazilian taxpayer. And then there's grease. I mean, that's still paying their debts from Athens. And 2004 nonetheless though things they aren't changing.

Speaker 1:          09:47          Sure.

Speaker 2:          09:55          Is there any future for the Olympics? As we said before, in the nineties and the first decade of this century, anytime the IOC and match, there were around five candidate cities. Nonetheless in the vote for the Olympics in 2020 the one that Tokyo one there were just three candidates in the last two beds for the Olympics. 2024 and 2028 there wasn't even a single vote because there was only one candidate city, Los Angeles in one case, and Paris in the other cities like Rome, Budapest in Stockholm, which once bid for the Olympics have already simply retired from the race bay. Just don't think it's worth

Speaker 1:          10:30          money.

Speaker 2:          10:35          And to all of those economists who were once silenced while they're starting to appear in the media. Meanwhile, the An indie games, sir losing a lot of their appeal for audiences, there are less and less viewers every time it runs. Platforms like Netflix, HBO, or even indeed Youtube are becoming big competition for traditional television. This means that by the time it Tokyo 2020 years health, many of you will be watching a TV show or official politic video instead of the synchronized swimming competition. And so well now you might be wondering, well how did the International Olympic Committee react to this? Well, the answer is probably going to disappoint you, but I see it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:15          Ioc Agenda 2020 allows the Olympics in different host countries. I mean, I'm not saying this is a bad idea, but it does make little sense if your goal is to reduce wasted money when organizing the Olympic Games. I mean, yeah, it is good now that the spending could be divided among the taxpayers have two different countries, but then also have twice as many venues as before. So in other words, it's not actually that great of an idea. Now, wait just a second here because this is not the only proposal you see lately. There's a movement that suggesting something a bit more revolutionary. They wanted to get rid of city rotation. This would mean that the Olympic Games would always be organized in the same city this way, which is neat to buy one stadium and one Olympic villa that could be reused every single time. Some economists like Andrew's Marlis suggest Los Angeles is the perfect city to become the eternal Olympic host. It's big enough they have an international airport and they can receive all the tourists and they also have a pretty solid media industry.

Speaker 3:          12:19          The solution has a problem. If there is no competition among cities to host the Olympics and the IOC would lose its negotiating leverage, be no incentive to bribe or provide luxury to IOC leaders and sooner or later Los Angeles or some other city that would become the permanent host would start demanding things like a greater share of the money from the broadcasting. Right.

Speaker 2:          12:50          So now the question comes around too. Do you think the International Olympic Committee, we'll find an alternative solution to get back their lost prestige or perhaps we will see the ends of the Olympic Games as we know it's, well, please leave your answer in the comment section below.
