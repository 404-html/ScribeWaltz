Speaker 1:          00:07          Located in the Persian Gulf because Howard is a country with an area of a little more than 10,000 square kilometers, just to give you some idea of just how small that is. Nearly 40 times smaller than California, so when this country got its independence from the UK in Nineteen 71 guitar was a faraway, hostile and very, very poor place. As a matter of fact, it was one of the poorest territories of the United Kingdom and well that kind of made a lot of sense. The Guitar Peninsula is a place where temperatures can reach 50 degrees Celsius in summer. It's almost completely covered by desert and it was certainly one of the most uninhabitable places on earth, but it didn't stay that way forever. And today guitar is the richest country on the planet. Well, that's right to the citizens of this tiny nation. Enjoy a per capita income of more than $125,000, which is almost three times the income in France. And to follow your time is that found in

Speaker 2:          01:02          really.

Speaker 1:          01:09          This is a country which was almost uninhabited. A country third could hardly survive on it's fishing industry, and today it looks something like scrooge mcduck safe

Speaker 1:          01:24          governments, government investments and properties all around the world, the birthplace of Alpha zero, the most important Arabic media company. Well then there was Doha, the capital, which is a sea of skyscrapers and luxurious cars, a mix of Monaco in vegas, but without the alcohol and gambling, there's no room for simplicity. Everything is sumptuous, huge and sparkling in Doha on how Sausalito conflict areas reporter gets, has gone from being a dark shelter for what harvest preachers and has become a watch. People might consider the most open country in the Middle East. This is of course excluding Dubai birds. As you might know, Dubai is an emirate and not actually a country something Doha. We can find international universities or the Falls Church city, a complex of Protestant Orthodox and Catholic churches like the Church of our lady rosary million dollar Catholic Church, which seats 2,700 is located in the southern outskirts of the city on land donated by seek Hamad bin Khalifa. Funny Qatar's emir. So now the question of course has to be how did Qatar achieve this remarkable transformation? Well, let's take a look at

Speaker 2:          02:35          that. The

Speaker 1:          02:39          LNG blessing, liquefied natural gas. In other videos we have discussed the keys as to why some countries are so rich, but in this case it is much simpler and it can be summarized. Blink two things. Oh, bands. More importantly, natural gas, a massive, massive amounts of natural gas. That really is pretty much it. If you'll just voice it will just hold on a second because it's actually quite an interesting story

Speaker 2:          03:05          already.

Speaker 1:          03:07          The fields they were found in the 19 forties and by the 19 sixties, exploitation was already consolidators and things in the poor country of Qatar changed, but not really that much. The thing is that it wasn't until the beginning of the 19 seventies that shell founds the biggest treasure of this country and that would be the north fields, which is the largest gas field in the world

Speaker 1:          03:33          at that time. Well, natural gas, it just wasn't that profitable. You see at the time gasket only be transported through gas pipes and guitar was far from places where this gas could be used. Even Shell, well, they soon forgot about it, but well things they were really about to change in 1996, the older male, bin Khalifa, al tiny, who abdicated in 2013 staged acute atar while his father was in Switzerland. This Amir reached our with a clear idea and that was the future of guitar was in gas. They simply had to exploit their huge gasfields man so well. He did just that. The new mayor decided to invest in an undeveloped Andrew rare technology. This technology, it's liquefaction, which is the ability to carry natural gas in its liquid form so that it can be transported in large ships as if it was oil. In order to do this, the gas needed to cool down and be kept at a temperature of minus 161 degrees Celsius, which is minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit. Now this is something that is pretty inconvenient to do

Speaker 1:          04:37          so well. I could tell they decided to invest enormous quantities of resources in order to boost the development of this technology so that it can be used on a massive scale. Because of that as investments. Guitar is now the world's largest exporter of LNG. With this technology, guitar is able to export its enormous gas supplies to the rest of the world. In fact, last year, three quarters of guitars, gas went to Asian countries like China, India, South Korea, and Japan as well. There's more because the industrial complex that guitar has developed is so big, so large scale that the country has managed to have the cheapest costs of extraction and liquefaction in the entire world. To illustrate this, a 10 career, LNG is four times cheaper and guitar than it is in the United States and this, well, that's the secret of this small and wealthy country. But this, you know, there's only a part of the equation. I mean, not only does the country have to exploit the resources they have, but they also need to use that money to generate other money or they're going to end up like Angola or Venezuela. So besides this innovative process, guitar has some other keys to their success,

Speaker 1:          05:47          star power,

Speaker 2:          05:51          some

Speaker 1:          05:51          odd bin. Kalief Jatani reached power in 1995. Things they have changed significantly and is 18 years leading the country Qatar's population. It's multiplied by while at the same time it's become the richest country on it.

Speaker 2:          06:04          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:08          the older mayor, he's got plenty of reasons to feel proud of himself. But let's move on from this because it started to generate a lot of economic resources and the question now is, well, what are they doing with this money well spent would it may look like they've actually mostly invested it both nationally and internationally. It's hard. They've created the Qatar Investment Authority, which is a huge funds to invest money all around the world. It is known as guitars power because they have in their hands more than $330,000,000,000. And when you consider that the population of guitar is less than 3 million people, but if those 3 million people, only 300,000 citizens, well you can do the math. This fund, it has made significant real estate investments all over the world.

Speaker 1:          06:57          A big part of the city belongs to Qatar and including offices, hotels, apartments and swell. In the United States, guitar was in 2016. The fourth largest office investor in the country in Manhattan alone. This fund is invested $5,000,000,000 in the last two years and they're not just investing in real estate. This funds also has major shares in many multinationals. It gets on this, for instance, one of the largest shareholders of companies like Volkswagen, Iberdrola, Barclays Bank, tiffany and co Shell, or even the judge, rough snaps the oil company of the Russian governments. In the image I'm about to show you, you can see how much foreign investment has increased as the production of gas and oil has grown

Speaker 2:          07:38          pants.

Speaker 1:          07:39          It's not just international investments here. They're also investing lots of resources inside the country. Tens of billions has been spent on highways, ports, airports, research centers, financial centers, etc. Etc. So you might bE asking now, what's the goal of all of this? Well, that is to be able to in the future, replace the income they get from island gas, with income from all of these investments versus you know what? The moment when the gas business runs out is still too far away to really be a problem. No analysts who can say when demand for gas, we'll wait for oil. There are people who See peak demand demanded 20, 30 others in 20, 42, but for gas demand is constantly growing. This idea they have of investing rather than spending the money from natural resources might be at one of the most important differences between Qatar and other countries who are also rich in natural resources. Most of them, they find it too easy to spend the money. Today. Man's not think too much about the future effective independent

Speaker 2:          08:43          when someones

Speaker 1:          08:44          been kelly for our tiny reached power. He also had another thing in mind, Qatar. It had to gain international influence. You see, for years, guitar was controlled. A de facto bike. Saudi arabia under the new amir just couldn't forget about iraq's invasion of Kuwait. If gasol wanted to survive, they needed to claim their identity and gain international influence. Otherwise any conflict with radar could compromise the independence of the country besides well natural gas, it could pay the bills now,

Speaker 3:          09:18          sorry,

Speaker 1:          09:18          in 2003 when Saudi Arabia or requested that the u s take american troops out of that country guitar, didn't hesitate to offer itself as a destination for those trips. They didn't even blink when it came to spending about $8,000,000,000 to build the military bases that were needed.

Speaker 3:          09:35          Yes,

Speaker 1:          09:40          brawling based 20 miles southwest of the qatari capital of doha is home to some 11,000 us military personnel. Indeed, it could be said that Qatar has taken out a very comprehensive insurance policy and then we have the founding of al jazeera. this has the objective of obtaining global influence bands. Well, they succeeded and this is something we actually covered in a previous video that you should definitely check out. They also developed a foreign policy driving towards international influence

Speaker 4:          10:11          blockade.

Speaker 1:          10:14          All this political strategy made both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia very angry and in june of 2017, they announced a blockade accusing Qatar of supporting fundamentalist groups and terrorists, and when it comes to Saudi Arabia, we could definitely call this a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Now, it is true that Qatar has some dark secrets. I mean it is an absolute monarchy after all, but the country is a good ally for the west, especially the United States, and it's also one of the most open countries in the region. The truth is that the boycotts, it had a different target to cut down guitars, strategy of international influence, and to essentially put them back in that place. However, the blockade, well, it's been a total failure. First results position is not that strong. Very few countries have supported us, not even Kuwait or in mind. Also, Qatar has developed to better relationships with Turkey bands.

Speaker 1:          11:05          Even Iran console has simply proved that they are strong enough to weather the storm. And finally it's really important that we didn't make something clear. There aren't plenty of gray areas in Qatar labor conditions that are more consistent with the ones of have a poor country, the situation of women in the country and the lack of a democracy. Furthermore, the system needs to prove that it can work without the government because unlike dubai, the lead has been taken by public initiative, not private, and this is one of the reasons why dubai is still above khatami in pretty much all aspects, but I am. And it would it be fair to not acknowledge what they're doing right, like they're saving capacity. That productive investments, um, is there openness? And While that's our opinion here at visual politic and now we would love to know what you think, who do you think will win the battle of the countries in the persian gulf, saudi, or maybe Qatar?
