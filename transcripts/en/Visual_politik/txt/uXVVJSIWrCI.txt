Speaker 1:          00:07          This is the only country along with Greece that is cora now than before having the euro as their official currency to figures leave no space for doubt. Italians now have less purchasing power than before they joined the euro, which makes them one of the few countries that became worse off after joining the European. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30          We also looking about the second biggest industrial power in all of Europe, which is only surpassed by Germany. In fact, during the nineties, the Italians were wealthier than the British and the French. Now, if you're my age or older, you might remember Ross Zazi, Luciano Pavarotti, or these so called Spaghetti Westerns. Yes. To view isn't. He was one of the biggest powerhouses on the planet and all the spine to their governments and their ruling class. The political history of Italy is our. Should we say it well, let's just say it makes game of thrones looked like the gilmore girls. Remember, it's Allianz Se Sicilian, Cosa Nostra, the Kalibrasi Drain Gretta, the Napoleon Komora, and many, many other gangs and yes, all of them have important connections with the highest levels of politicians, but there's more than just a Nafisa here. During the Cold War, some government officials held extreme right wing terrorists. Groups that organize the most violence is acts that you could imagine, and that's not even talking about the extreme left wing, which defines exactly stay quiet. Either the Red Brigades kidnapped and murdered an Italian pronunciation.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Look,

Speaker 1:          01:40          if you're into scary stories, you should google something about the propaganda duo more. You can just watch the movie Il Divo from Paolo Sorrentino. You will discover a fascinating country where politics, anything was boring and now you might be wondering, well, what exactly is going on in Italy today? Do they have as much instability as they did in the 19 seventies in the 19 eighties? And he also was absolutely in just 10 years. If at six different prime ministers 10 years. In other words, keeping up with Italian politics is pretty impossible mission and this is why in this video we're not actually going to talk about the Italian elections that have been celebrated recently, not even about Berlusconi's and love life. Oh no, because the real question here is how is it possible that such a chaotic country could manage to become quite so wealthy and what is happening now? Often two decades of economic stagnation. Today we're going to answer both of those questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the good, the bad, and the ugly of Italian history.

Speaker 3:          02:43          Julio

Speaker 1:          02:44          and the reality is the good. During the 1940 years, the Italian Communist Party was the biggest of its kind all across western Europe with more than one point 3 million members. They could win an election anytime they want it. As you can imagine, the middle of the Cold War, this was something America could not happen. So you remember the Marshall Plan? Well, if you've been following visual politics for a long time, you already know that Uncle Sam sent lots and lots of money to Europe so they can rebuild that destroyed city when it came to you. Isn't this money, was not an immense to help the country, but also to finance the only political party you could face that communist threat. This policy was called Christian democracy. Mother's save your children from Bolshevism vote Christian democracy in the next 50 years. It's an he had 30 different prime ministers. This means that the average span of an Italian government was a little more than a year and a half, but they all had something in common. Most of them, they were Christian. Democrat. Governor within the Christian Democrats is a man that you should know. His name was Julio, Andrea [inaudible], and he became prime minister seven different times and is the real godfather of Christian democracy. For years, no Italian politician could do anything without being. Last Minute Mrs Andreotti

Speaker 1:          04:17          power wears out those who don't have it, Julio and royalty. But now the obvious question is, well, what did the Christian Democrats stand for? Well, Christine Democracy was basically what we call a catch up all party. Anyone except communists could find his or her place inside of this policy, and this included deals with Napoleon Kamora, the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, and allegedly extreme right wing groups that terrorize the country during the 19 eighties, but we're going to talk about all of that in a future video. The important thing here is that Andreotti and his Christian Democrats badly needed popular support and you know, you need to win some elections. Did you do that? What's better than employing people with a good salary? You see, Italy has over three point $5 million civil servants and they are among the highest paid in the entire world. This means a crazy public spending and lots of bureaucracy and toxins. Okay? Reality is time until now, easily is famous for two things. Redstate and ineffective course, a better understanding. Let's imagine we have a company that produces construction machines and we have clients who doesn't pay US naturally. We would probably want to take him to court

Speaker 1:          05:29          if we all in say France. This process could take around two and a half months, but in the you could wait more than three years before the problem gets solved. As you might imagine, this is not exactly the best of business planets, but nevertheless, I did say this sleep became one of the wealthiest countries in all of Europe, so how is that possible?

Speaker 2:          05:53          Well,

Speaker 1:          05:54          do you have. You have the onset lies in the Italian lira? Yes. You heard that right? When they had their own currency, the Italian central bank could evaluate their currency anytime they needed to put their economy on steroids. When now you might be wondering, well, but Simon, isn't that the worst thing that you could do? For instance, in another video I told you that Germany became rich partly because they have a very stable currency, the deutschmark and now it seems that I'm telling you the exact opposite. I mean, how is it possible to digitally could grapes so much having so much corruption, so much red tape, and it's just constant evaluations. Well, let's dive in.

Speaker 4:          06:35          Freddy is the ugly,

Speaker 1:          06:37          having exited more than 1700 movies. Rocco said Freddy. Okay. The Italian stallion dominated the adult section of rental stores worldwide during the 19 eighties, and yes, he is also an interesting symbol of the Italian economy at that time, a growth model that relied heavily on inflation during the eighties and the nineties. It's elite flooded the world with cheap products. They were a kind of 20th century China. As soon as something works in some other country, some Italian company would show up and make the same thing, but do it cheaper. Let's have a look as an example. American movies in America, John Wayne Movies were incredibly successful. Let's go to Debbie, so it was highly and movie producers started doing more of the same, but at the industrial level, and this is how the Spaghetti Western was at the same time, the exact same thing was happening with other industries. Well, Donna summer was making the entire world. Dan's Italian struck back with Sabrina who did the same but cheaper and more explicitly. What about animated movies? Walt Disney was launching a landon in movie theaters. The cheap Italian version was already available in all of the countries. Video stores. That's innocently. They were cheaply reproducing more than just culture in general. Italian companies mastered the art of making cheap things, or as economists would say, low added value manufacturing isn't he produced clothes, furniture, and plenty of plastic items. If you bought an animated action figure in the 19 nineties, it probably has a made in Italy label somewhere bus. If you bought a stereo sound system, it would have a made in Germany or made in Japan label and now the question arises, well, why was the Italian economy so strongly based on selling cheap things abroad?

Speaker 3:          08:26          Well,

Speaker 4:          08:26          look at this chart, you can see the value of the Italian lira against the German mark. As you can see, during the eighties and nineties, Italian currency was losing value all the time. In 1980 you could get 450 liras for one German mark. Fifteen years later you get a thousand liras for one German mark. So what does this mean? It means innovation was way more expensive for Italian companies than for German ones.

Speaker 1:          08:50          For instance, imagine we have an Italian production company during the 19 eighties and we want to a really innovative movie. Something like star wars with state of the art, special effects and cutting edge technology if we want to do that, so we need to buy animation software that's produced in Japan and special cameras from America, but since our Italian currency is losing value all the time, those things are more expensive for us and to answer this that anytime we need to hire someone new, we're having to cut through never ending red tape, so suddenly not salmon is a good, is it?

Speaker 3:          09:19          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:22          but now imagine that instead of making a stall was like film. We call our friend Rocco's Freddy and we make an adult movie with him. We just need a couple of cameras. Remanned a bet, and since we have a weak currency, we can sell on movies abroad for a lower price than any other film. So simply following this model, the Italian economy, it grew sky high. During these years, thousands of smaller companies were born, but make no mistake here, Italian smes have nothing to do with German smes. You see, German middle stands had between 50 and 200 workers and they had enough scale to invest money on research and innovation. Italian companies were way smaller than methods were more traditional and their industries where well more in Italy started taking account of its shadow economy, found that it made up a fifth of Italian GDP. As a result, the economy grew by 18 percent overnight, so now you might wonder, why should Italians innovate so much if they were doing so well by not doing it well. Now I'm going to tell you why Silvio Berlusconi is the ugly. Now, finally, the 21st century, Christine Democracy, not really that important anymore. Now the brand new leader of the center, right wing is the man you see on screen now and yes, you might know that his name is Silvio Berlusconi

Speaker 1:          10:49          little hair because my brain is so big, it pushes everything else out. Suvio Berlusconi thousands. He was not the best year to the Italian prime minister. You know why? Well, because 2002 was the Italy abandons the Italian lira and started using the euro. And what's the main characteristic of the euro? Well, no, governments can decide by itself when they devalue. That's yours are issued by the European Central Bank, which includes representatives of all the member countries. This was a big problem for a country like Italy, which had become so addicted to devaluation, but things don't stop there. Maybe you remember another thing that happens at the beginning of the two thousands. And if you don't say, well let me refresh your memory. Joins the World Trade Organization at last. And so now you might be wondering, well, does China have to do with the Italian economy? Well, as you might guess rather lot, the fact that China had joined the World Trade Organization was a symptom of something much bigger as men's. All of Asia was flooding the international markets and it was not only China. Other countries like Thailand and Bangladesh were already becoming manufacturing powerhouses. And surprise surprise. What did these countries start manufacturing first? Well, very, very cheap things. Same as the Italians buts even cheaper.

Speaker 1:          12:08          Thanks. Then Germany was already off technology wise. So despite the Asian competition that products, they were still competitive. Meanwhile isn't he could not go back to old school devaluation first, they were now part of the euro and second devaluing wasn't a solution against Asia's cheap salaries. Here's an example. One of the most symbolic Italian companies is Fiat. In 1998, they sold over one point $3 million cars in your. Now they only sell 700,000 and they can't get into new markets.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Other brands like BMW still maintain their share on their traditional markets and also they're growing and emerging countries like China, but just, Oh, hold on a minute here because we're not done yet. You really know how it's has over 3 million civil servants. Well, they all still there and they still have to be paid. In other words, while the Italian economy is falling and the government is collecting fewer and fewer taxes, they all still spending the same amount of money. So what? What does that mean? It means essentially is now the fourth most indebted country on the planet. They're public debt is over 130 percent of their GDP, and this certificate is simply crazy. Is Europe's next big?

Speaker 1:          13:26          So now the question is, should Italy abandon the euro so that they can go back to that devaluation methods and cheap manufacturing? Maybe they should follow the German model and let their companies innovate more while I've said my piece. So I'll just leave it to you to leave your comments in the section below.
