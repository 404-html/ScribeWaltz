Speaker 1:          00:00          How do you measure a country's power? By power, I mean it's ability to impose its will over other countries. We could measure their GDP, their economic growth, or perhaps even the size of the army, but I've got another idea. The best way of showing your power is forcing other countries as large as yours to make a big sacrifice. The sacrifice might be something that goes against their will, that they will do it because you want them to, well, this is what trump is trying to do to the European Union and what is the big sacrifice that he wants the Europeans to make it as easy. He wants them to cut their ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The question is, is it really that big of a sacrifice and most importantly, Kenny, when this bat, well, these are the very questions we're going to answer in this video. Iran is that country. We've all these independent movies that yes, say you're like, but you've never, never watched. Now there is something even more important to Iran's economy and that's automobiles.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Yes, Divya is, Iran is actually one of the biggest con manufacturers in all of the Middle East and I know we have probably thinking right now, you're probably thinking you're on ready Simon Development, gumtree, virtually isolated making cars, but as surprised as you might be, they even have their own brands. For example, the beautiful vehicle that you see here is the Qataris a mind. It's a sedan that sells in Iran as a genre in Russia. In Venezuela. Okay, okay. You shouldn't have really expected anything. Amazing. The engines are old and the manufacturer does have a lot to improve, but I mean, look, what can you expect for $700 and seriously, we actually think that if you took this car, you improve it with a bit of modern technology would actually be quite a good deal. You see, we actually think that if you took this car, improved it with some modern technology, it would still be cheap and it would probably be like not a terrible vehicle. It would probably do really well in developing markets. And actually this is why since 2015 when most of neurons, all sanctions were lifted, many European companies actually started investing in the country.

Speaker 2:          02:38          Great

Speaker 1:          02:39          to enter new joint venture,

Speaker 2:          02:41          right? Sit

Speaker 1:          02:46          back on the road and your end with deal to build cars, but there is a way, way more than cost. You see, the Iranian stock market has a market capitalization three times bigger than the Egyptian one and they have all kinds of companies. Unlike other oil rich countries in the region who runs economy is surprisingly diversified. Banks, mining companies and even telecoms all exist and this what is attracted other European companies. Mark's entry into Aren with high web partnership. If this wasn't enough, Iran has a well educated population. The literacy rate is way higher than that of Syria, Iraq and many of the neighboring countries, well then 4 million citizens study or have studied at university and this means a well trained workforce that can work for really quite low wages. Add to this, the fact that the country has over 80 million people and some of them, you've actually got a really good place for investment. Nonetheless, this wave of European money has all of a sudden just stopped.

Speaker 2:          03:49          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:53          well, absolutely sanctioned European companies that do business with Iran. But hold on a minute. I mean, Donald Trump, he's the American president. He can make rules for American. How many he's all he wants, but European countries, I mean, he's not the president of the world. How can you impose rules over countries that he doesn't govern? Well, that is another question we're going to answer today, but before we do, as always, let's take a look back at the history. Beagle dual in March, 2018 zed te or Chinese phone manufacturer, I had to pay a $1 billion fines of the united. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Why? Well, they imported microchips from America and sold them to Iran. The White House basically saw this and said, ah, you're doing business with the bad guys. Now you gotta pay this crazy ass fine or I'm not going to let you sell your stuff in my country. This is a pretty big deal because if you don't selling in America, you're not selling in the world's richest country ever. It's really not an option. So he was willing to pay pretty much anything in order to stay in the market. And well, this same thing is happening with many other company.

Speaker 2:          05:04          Nice.

Speaker 1:          05:08          But as we said, European companies started doing business with Iran in 2015 and we're not talking about buying oil here, but investments of all kinds. This is why as soon as trump pasta, new sanctions, the EU

Speaker 2:          05:22          for oxygen Europe

Speaker 1:          05:25          requests exemptions from trump's Iran sanctions for energy aviation and more basically European leaders wrote a letter to the White House asking America to respect to their economic interests. As you know, trump isn't a big fan of the European Union, so you can imagine is onset. This is why in 2018 the European Union, so big action, it was time for regulation two two seven one slash nine six oh wait, you don't know what regulation two two seven one slash nine six is all about, oh, don't worry. No problem. That's why I'm here. You see regulation d two seven one slash nine six is something like a legal shield against trade wars. For example, let's say this Chevrolet discovers that Aramco has a factory on Iranian soil. They could take the French company to an American court and to make them pay a fine, but at that same moment, the European Union would impose an equivalent fine on Chevrolet, but this is still not the end of the story. Then suppose Renner says, hm, well then I'm going to leave Iran anyway. There's too much trouble that, well, in that case, the European Union could also find the company because technically they are complying with Washington's sanction. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:45          Say basically all wraps up. This basically means that all the companies doing business with Iran are kind of screwed if they stay. Washington screws them. If they leave the European Union screws them. It's sort of a really big lose lose and it's what's known as a political deal. So the question is now, who is more powerful? Who would the European companies prefer to get screwed by? Well, now we're going to see you.

Speaker 2:          07:15          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:15          the check. I'm sure all of you have made an international transfer at some point. Let's say you live in Canada and you need to be paid by an Australian company. When you send the invoice, you don't give you normal bank details like you'd give to a company in your country instead of your gift. This really long number that also has some letters in it. Look, something like this.

Speaker 2:          07:42          Well,

Speaker 1:          07:42          Lee's letters, all the so called swift. Yes.

Speaker 3:          07:49          Which system is what banks used for international money transfers. It is a network that connects all of the world's banks. A number of years around was disconnected from the swift network, so this means that even if you wanted to do business with Iran, he just couldn't,

Speaker 2:          08:07          after all,

Speaker 1:          08:10          how can you conduct business with somebody you can't even transfer money to? Of course, could send money in a briefcase, but that's not very convenient. In 2015 when that nuclear deal was signed, Iran returned to the swift system and this was the moment. This was the moment when, and Ron could go back to the international business scene. I know you might be wondering, well, who controls the swift system? Well, yeah, absolutely. You guessed it. It's of course a company called swift, the Society for worldwide into bank financial transactions and guests where they have the headquarters. Oh yeah, it's in Brussels. So yeah, I probably know what you're now thinking. You're thinking if all of the international transactions and managed in a euro, then America doesn't have to do much to avoid doing business with Iran, right? Well, no, not right at all. Very, very wrong. You see, swift is actually a cooperative society. This means all the important decisions made by a board of managers with 25 representatives from the most important.

Speaker 2:          09:06          Thanks

Speaker 1:          09:11          side of this board of managers. There are two Americans. One is from Citibank and another is from jp Morgan Chase.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Two representatives will have to pay crazy fines if they can't convince their colleagues to disconnect Iran from the swift system. If this happened, Iran would be isolated from the international market. If you can't make transactions, you can't do business. It's really just that simple. This is such an important matter that the European Union is already trying to come up with an alternative system for international transactions. Something like a modern day barter system. They call it spv or special purpose vehicle. The idea is that instead of exchanging goods for money, Europe wants to pay with credits for other goods. For example, let's say that Repsol a Spanish company wants to buy oil from Iran. Well, instead of paying with cash, they could pay with an equivalent some machinery.

Speaker 4:          10:08          Wow.

Speaker 1:          10:09          So now you might, you're on you. Well we got rid of the boss system really long time ago cause something like this really work today. Well, the answer is or any time is going to be able to tell, but let's assume that it actually does. Let's say the companies started using this spv system to trade with Iran. So let's get back to our reps. Will example. This dinosaur juice they just bought has to arrive somehow, right? Somehow somebody has to put it on a tanker and take it into Barcelona's harbor. Well, most of the old hangars isn't on the planet then managed by a Danish company called nurse Gif and Denmark. Well that's in Europe, but hold on a second. No harbor is going to accept an oil ship if it's not insured. And it turns out most of the insurance company is work with oil tankers are American or have a lot of interest in America, which explains news like this.

Speaker 2:          11:02          Shipping

Speaker 1:          11:03          giant Marishka to abandoned Iran as threat of sanctions grows. Other countries like China, they already found alternatives. They have enough at stake, so you convinced them to do everything they can to keep oil suppliers coming in from Iran. It's their sixth biggest providers. 7% of their dynoed juice comes from Tehran, the Europe. Europe is a different animal. In that case, Iran isn't important enough to risk so much on this. In other words, if you're up wanted to keep buying crude all from Iran, they would have to find one new transport companies to new insurance companies and three, they would have to use bartering.

Speaker 5:          11:42          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:43          okay. I look at anything is really possible, but so far it does seem that America and Donald Trump is gonna win this match against the European Union and all of this has got a whole bunch of consequences. In a previous video, we talked about what's happening with the international all markets in the following weeks. We want to talk about what's going to happen to the Uranian regime. Meanwhile, the big question is can be sanctions and the Iranian regime. How much can all prices go up? You can write me your theories and in the following days, let's have a look and see if they match with ours. In the meantime, do you visit reconsider media?
