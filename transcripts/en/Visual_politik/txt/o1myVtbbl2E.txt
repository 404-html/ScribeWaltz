Speaker 1:          00:07          We might not notice it, but the weld is changing really, really fun.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Austin

Speaker 1:          00:20          biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology, every day somewhere on some discovery is being made. Discoveries that will make our lines longer, more comfortable and generally just much better. We could always say, dear viewer, that we are on board or high speed train bounds for the future.

Speaker 2:          00:36          John,

Speaker 1:          00:38          that already companies in existence today, which look like they could have come straight out of a science fiction movie. Would you like some examples? Well then are you familiar with Oregon? Novo? It's a truly incredible company. It's listed on the Nasdaq and did business is no less than the bioprinting of tissues to implant into the human body and thus eliminating the need for organ transplants. Can you imagine printing and liver. It's truly remarkable.

Speaker 2:          01:02          Stop.

Speaker 1:          01:05          What about the company? Modern meadow. This startup's aim is to produce leather and meet without having to kill any animals. They want to reduce that own stakes in the lab and then take them to the bowl.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18          The question is though, would you eat it? So how about another example of a heard of Illumina? It's the largest company dedicated to DNA sequencing in the wealth among other targets. They are trying to detect cancer before any of the symptoms appear. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:33          Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Well, these are only three of hundreds of companies which are literally building the future today. Well, you know what? Organ Printing, DNA sequencing, that's not really the best part. The best part is the end of poverty is getting closer every day and the reality is that it's already right around the corner. And listen, we're not just talking about extreme poverty here on the contrary, current realities like hunger or not being able to eat meat or not having access to healthcare or even not being able to go on holiday aren't going to be rare and very infrequent in the near future. And it's blowing near future. We mean this is going to be a reality and probably just a few years. Alright. Alright, so now some of you must be thinking, Simon's finally lost it. It's all down here for visual politic from here. Well, no, actually I haven't lost my mind. In fact, hit with all of you as witnesses. I am willing to bet you that's in the next year, we will experience the best period of prosperity in the history of mankind and I'm certainly not the only one who shares this opinion. Listen to what Warren Buffett, the investment genius has to say about it,

Speaker 3:          02:43          or how about Barack Obama as well. If you had a choice of when to be born and you didn't know ahead of time who you were going to be, what nationality, whether you were male or female, what religion, but you said when in human history be the best time to

Speaker 4:          03:00          be born.

Speaker 1:          03:01          The time would be now while I'm here to tell you even more, this wave of prosperity will bring opportunities we've never even thought of before. Alright. Alright. But for the skeptics era, the numbers.

Speaker 2:          03:13          Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Tonight at the, by the end of 2016, three point 2 billion people are already going to be in the middle class and two each year, more than 140 million people will make it into this select club. It is as if every year a group of people the size of the population of Mexico. Oh, leaving poverty behind. Notice that this process is accelerating and it's expected that by 20, 20, that's just three years from the time of this video coming out, most of the world's population will belong to the middle class. This growth in the middle class will mean that the poor will finally be in

Speaker 2:          03:55          Rsa.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Before I continue, I am sure you might be wondering how exactly do you define middle class? Since income levels vary from country to country. When we talk about middle class, what we're talking about is people who can afford to have a very diverse people who can face and cover unexpected expenses as well as education and people who can buy an automobile. These people, they might not be rich, but they definitely are poor anymore and this is a brand new thing in the history of men

Speaker 2:          04:28          pies.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Now they have an idea of how things are changing today. Let's have a look at the historical perspective. When the Polian was fighting everyone in Europe, only 2 million people could be considered middle class. That is less than half of the population of Singapore today. A pretty tough situation for the vast majority of people who were living at that time, well since then, 150 years have passed, but it wasn't until the 19 seventies, but the number of people in the middle class passed the 1 billion people today. The number is about 3 billion by 20, 21 is expected to reach for Binyam ends. As I mentioned, the process. It's getting faster and faster every single day. And this nice middle class, they are going to make an impressive entrance. Don't believe me.

Speaker 4:          05:20          And as we have these billions of people in lodging into a global middle class, they need to be fed. They need to be housed, they need power, they need transport, uh, they want to, they want to travel and see the world. So there are tremendous opportunities for an expansion of economic activity to meet their needs.

Speaker 2:          05:46          Yes,

Speaker 1:          05:46          versiti you're looking at right now is Hanoi, which is the capital of Vietnam. If the country in the world where capitalism is actually most liked, that's according to a recent study from the Pew Research Center. Seems like we're in the west. Might have some catching up to do. In fact, the majority of this new middle class, they're coming from Asia, almost nine out of every 10 new people. They make it to the middle class and live in Asia. The continent of the economic boons and the growing epicenter of power on earth. You just have to take a look at countries like the Philippines or Thailand in just a few years. These countries, middle classes will be as big as those in the UK, France and Italy. Yes, they will remain poorer countries, but the growth of the middle class, it's still very impressive. Bots do you want to know how things are really changing? Well, this is Jakarta. Well that means for the companies, but that's something we're going to get into later, but out of all these countries, one is making a particularly big difference and that's China who's middle class has absolutely exploded according to estimations by Mckinsey analysts. If in five years this isn't, the homes of people were to create, say the Chinese Republic of middle class citizens, this country would be the third most populated country in the world. No bad a sorry if he wants to know what these changes really mean. Take a look at Truong quizzing the most populated city in China

Speaker 1:          07:29          because of the growth of the middle class. These people now have money available to buy all kinds of products, clothing and like tronics cars and of course travel, and now you can probably understand why the countries in Asia, especially China, are so important for multinational companies.

Speaker 5:          07:45          Canada's largest online ride hailing platform dd two things that it's received. One billion US dollars from us tech giants, apple pay

Speaker 1:          07:53          close attention to this data because it's probably interesting if you're starting a business, it is estimated that the spending growth of the Chinese in the next four years alone will exceed what the British or German spent. Sorry, refute our visual politic. Friends are the company you might want to think about investigating the Asian market because many opportunities will appear in the next few years.

Speaker 6:          08:22          Consequences

Speaker 1:          08:22          of this, I'm just an opportunity to make money and do more business. Probably the most important consequences of this middle class expansion is that we will live in a happier world. Let me explain. You've probably heard the phrase money doesn't make you happy. Well, actually, according to recent research, this is not entirely true. In 2010 Angus Deaton and Daniel Conaman booster winners of the Nobel Prize in economics presented a paper which proved that up to the figure of $75,000 a year, happiness and income with very closely related, meaning more income equals more happiness up to $5,000 a year. I mean, this makes sense. We have more money. You don't have to worry about making it to the end of the month, paying your bills and not having enough to eat as well as not being able to take your family to the doctor and etc. Etc. So according to thEse two academics, the expansion of the middle class is leading to a happier world. But wait just a minute because there is more. More middle claSs means more educated people. This means more researchers and more entrepreneurs, more ideas, more innovation. Man's therefore more progress. Well today in China that are more college students have any in the United States. Remember the companies that we saw at the beginning of this video, well, soon enough, there are going to be plenty more of those.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Now. You may be wondering, is this all really is wonderful as we're describing a visual politic? How come people such as Donald Trump and le pen are so popular then? Well, this middle class boom is not happening in all parts of the world. Therefore it's really important. We understand that if western economies aren't working perfectly, are having problems, they should take responsibility for it and stop blaming it on other countries. There are plenty of opportunities in the global economy and now is the time to adapt and sees them, but now I can probably guess what your thinking is. All of this group really sustainable ways. All of this progress and development destroy the environment so cause other such problems. Well, that's not exactly clear.

Speaker 1:          10:21          It's true that in theory, more middle class means more spending and therefore more consumerism and more pressure on natural resources, etc. But that awesome things to consider first more middle class also means more people in big cities and the consumerism here is usually more sustainable. Transport is the most evidence. Example, my public transport is frequent in large cities. It is rare in small places. More middle class also means faster demographic transition, so more women's study and work and say the population tends to shrink as well and above all more middle class means, as we said before, more ideas and more innovation and among these things are often ideas which allow more sustainable consumerism. So however we want to approach this situation and although that is certainly a lot of room for advancement and improvement, we think that this really is a time in history when we should all be feeling rather positive, but that's our opinion at visual politic. Ams. Now we would like to know what you think. Do you Believe we are moving towards a better world?
