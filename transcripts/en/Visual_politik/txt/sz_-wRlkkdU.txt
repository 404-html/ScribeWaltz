Speaker 1:          00:08          Doesn't seem that lately a lot of movies have been shot in London. One example is bridget Jones's baby, a movie from the Bridget Jones's soccer, which I might've seen just look at the skyscrapers in the backgrounds of that movie. Those were simply not there in the first movie of the saga. In fact, London skyline has changed dramatically in the last 10 years alone, and this is pretty surprising because we're not talking about an emerging economies like China or

Speaker 2:          00:36          actually

Speaker 1:          00:37          the overall economy in the UK as an all performance that well over the last few years. However, the London is another world entirely today. It is one of the four fastest growing capitals on the planet almost growing at the same level as Dubai. Their population has increased by 50 percent in the last few decades, particularly odd on a continental Europe where all countries are seeing overall population decline. Instead, London has 3 million more inhabitants and not only that, but in the finance wells, London is now more important than New York City itself. So now you might be wondering what exactly has happened in London that has caused this massive success? Well, that's the question we're going to be answering in today is visual politic video ration. The United Kingdom has always been a country of immigrants and the London was always the main destination. Nonetheless, in the last decade, immigration has apps and the sky rocketed after Poland's became a member of the European Union in 2004. I lots of polls easily moved from Poland to London because there was no visa required.

Speaker 1:          01:55          The same happens when Bulgaria, Romania became part of the European Union in 2007. This created a whole new influx of immigrants adding to those already there from India and Pakistan. These European immigrants typically have higher education and university degrees. In fact, today in London has a one point 7 million highly skilled workers. While New York has one point 6 million immigrants are not only working the jobs that British people don't want to do anymore. Instead they are coming to the country and starting their own businesses or getting hired in the high tech sector. But Tom started his marketing business four years after arriving from Warsaw. He now employs six people and four of them are British. That's companies are far more than just job creating machines or economic growth engines. The fact that London has more educated people means more bars, more exhibitions, more culture. In summary, it has more of all the things that make a city look cool. For example, well, where's the best known Peruvian restaurants outside of Peru? Well, according to all of the gastronomical guides, it's restaurant called civic j, which of course is located in London. This is how London has created a virtuous cycle that has attracted more and more people. This is why in 2000 inmates, after the financial crisis hits many Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians, who wanted to leave their countries, saw London as the main destination. It was more than just a good place to find a job. It was a cool place. The myths, this is something that economists school the network effect. The more people and companies that you have, the easier it is to attract highly skilled immigrants.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Today, a new generation of coders, bankers, and financial wizards are remaking, is extraordinary place.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Interestingly, since 2010 over 1000 startups have been created in London every single year, but hold on a moment because there's more.

Speaker 2:          03:58          Oh,

Speaker 1:          04:00          city of London. All the skyscrapers that you see here are concentrated in a single area. This is an area and not bigger than a square mile. And it is known as the city of London or just with the city? Yes. On the one hand we do have London and then also on the other hand we have the city of London. You have London essentially works like it's own country within the United Kingdom. Yes. Now we normally say for Britain is made up of four nations, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but really this is not exactly true. In fact, we should really add a fifth one and this is the city of London. The city has its own laws and has its own

Speaker 3:          04:44          mayor. The city is the financial center of Great Britain. About 7,000 people live in this city, but each day 300,000 come to work and its banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Speaker 1:          04:58          London's mayor is the man we're showing on the screen now. His name is Sidique Khan, but the city of London has its own Lord, mayor, and his name is Jeffrey months events. One of the characteristics over the city, also known as the square mile, is the during elections, both citizens and companies have the right to vote. For example, a Unilever has its headquarters in the square mile. Therefore when elections come, Unilever is allowed to.

Speaker 2:          05:23          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:30          so now you might be wondering, does Unilever get the same voting power as a smaller company? Well, the answer is no. There's a number of votes a company gets. Depends on how many people say employment in the city. By the way, the music that is accompanying this video that you were listening to right now is by a band called the forgotten voice. There a pop rock bands from to you sent us that music to use in this video. And if you like it and you would like to hear more from them, it please do. Check out the links in the description below.

Speaker 1:          06:15          All right, so now you might be wondering whether the city of London is a fiscal haven and the answer is no. All across the UK taxes off, fairly similar to what is true is that the square mile does have more business friendly policies than the rest of the UK, for instance, that the development laws are much more free and open than the rest of the country and this is why they're all more skyscrapers bought when it comes to taxes. They are not a haven whatsoever, but it's. Hold on just a minute because the city does play a really important role. This is because the main task of the Lord mayor is do traveled around the world and promote London as a great place for doing

Speaker 2:          06:52          business.

Speaker 4:          06:55          Mayor of the city of London, Alderman Alan Yarrow is believe that business delegation to Indonesia, helping to make sure London and the UK remained the regional partner of choice when it comes to financial and professional services.

Speaker 1:          07:13          So you went away. You can say that London has its own marketing departments, showcasing all of the benefits of doing business there to the rest of the world

Speaker 2:          07:23          business

Speaker 1:          07:23          concentration. The US economy is divided among different cities. For example, politics is centered in Washington DC. Finance is in New York City. Entertainment is in Los Angeles, and technology is centered in San Francisco. The same happens in Germany where you have cities like Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich, andover. In Spain you have Barcelona,

Speaker 2:          07:44          correct.

Speaker 1:          07:46          On the other hands, Britain has London as well, just London. The other larger cities are far less important to the country's economy. In fact, London generates every one in five pounds. In the British economy. In this city, you will find all of the major government institutions, the banks, the technological center, the fashion center,

Speaker 2:          08:05          et Cetera.

Speaker 1:          08:10          While the amount of tax generated in London increased by 25 percent in real terms between 2005 and 2015, Manchester's fax intake by only one percent. Well, Birmingham, Glasgow and leads also significant decreases in their vaccine take and the tool of this, we should add another really important element and that's English. As you probably know, the UK has had a rather good relationship with the United States, well at least for the past two centuries, even though there is no trade agreements between the two countries. They do have a lot of history in common and importantly they speak the same language.

Speaker 2:          08:54          List

Speaker 1:          08:55          fact that the United Kingdom

Speaker 5:          08:56          is currently a part of the European Union and so you can see why London has become the gateway for American companies who want to do business in Europe. What London does, it is the capital of the euro and that means that 70 percent of forex trading and all sorts of other over the counter derivatives, all sorts of fancy stuff gets done through London. Although the UK is not in the euro, so there's a very difficult set of negotiations coming up.

Speaker 1:          09:28          But now the obvious and big question is going to be how is brexit going to affect London's growth? One thing is very clear and that's the. Well, the majority of the British population once it the UK, to leave the European Union, London wasn't very much.
