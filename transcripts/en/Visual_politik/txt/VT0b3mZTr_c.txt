Speaker 1:          00:08          It is known as the Rainbow Nation for its cultural, linguistic and religious diversity. Its Constitution alone acknowledges 11 different languages.

Speaker 2:          00:18          Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:19          this is South Africa or a country situated in the extreme south of average.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Gotcha.

Speaker 1:          00:25          It's not a small country. It's surface area is laundry than Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands combined. It is by far the most developed economy of all the countries situated south of the Sahara desert. In the year 2010 it was the first African country to holds a soccer world championship. This was the summer of [inaudible] Waka Waka, anyone cast around then? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:46          The box

Speaker 1:          00:51          pours in month in South Africa's history was April, 1994 between the 26th and 29th of that month, South Africa celebrated the first free universal ends, democratic elections. They were all seeing the longest because the election's lasted for four long days. During that time, South Africans left the house as massively devote. Having to wait in queues at kilometers long

Speaker 2:          01:15          ahead

Speaker 1:          01:16          was justified for these elections. Men to the ends of 300 years of colonialism and white supremacy. The elections mark to the end of apartheid.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Apartheid

Speaker 1:          01:31          was this system based on racial segregation, which remains in effect for 50 years. It mainly consisted of separating the whites population from the black population. This applies in any situation, living, studying, even the spending of leisure time. Obviously, as you might imagine, all of the best areas and services were built for bands used by the white population. A good example of this was the ambulances. Even though the black population where 80% of the population they barely had any ambulances to use. However, the ambulances for the white population were numerous and refused to carry any black passengers because they couldn't see according to the law.

Speaker 2:          02:07          Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:15          [inaudible] gave the white population all the political power and also established many limitations precisely in order to consolidate that white power. As an example, mixed race relationships and marriage work and for business. Quite simply, it left the black population in an inhumane

Speaker 2:          02:32          be

Speaker 1:          02:36          said that there were two different South Africa's one black and terribly poor and the other white, and it's very wealthy and of course those who rebels itself at a terrible punishments and repression. On the 16th of June, 1976 thousands of black students went on the demonstration to demand social and educative improvements. Hundreds of them were massacred.

Speaker 2:          02:54          I got into Denmark. I have this guy in my bag. I was running over the, they dumped that just writing away from the, from the police dream,

Speaker 1:          03:10          but all that changed in 1994 thanks for Nelson Mandela, also known as Madiba. He was considered the father of the country. Mandela led the political fight against apartheid and racism. God's, he had to pay for it. In 1961 he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the trail. Mandela spent 27 years in jail until 1992 nevertheless, two years after it was released in 1994 during the country's first free elections, he was elected as the president of South Africa, the first black president in the country's history. Often this happens. Many were surprised to see Mandela aiming for reconciliation rather than revenge and Della Dreamt of a free your 90 days and it's prosperous South Africa. He made it clear in his inaugural speech,

Speaker 3:          03:55          we have time and I thought the implant hoping the on the Miller of Rp, we have dry into our covenant that wish I healed the society in which all South Africa can I can. Why wouldn't be able to walk, talk without tenure? Fear in their hearts. I saw off the hype of human dignity. Grain partners at peace with itself and the wealth.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Mandela caps is worse. He works towards the United South Africa. It's when the time came, he left power following the limits of the constitution. This all turns him into a legend

Speaker 4:          04:28          country. What does Rebecca for Bay? The past is the past. We look to the future now.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Well, let's now focus on present day South Africa. It is the only country in the world's to have three capital cities, Cape Town, the capital city for legislative power, Pretoria for executive power and it's blue fontane feed judicial capitol city, and on top of all that, neither is the most populated. All the one where most businesses concentrates. For that we have to move to a fourth city Johannesburg. It's even not uncommon for different textbooks to stay to different cities as the capital of South Africa. Now after the fall of apartheid, South Africa experienced quite an economic boost since 1994 the economy considering purchasing power has it

Speaker 2:          05:13          great. He

Speaker 1:          05:19          has been strongly reduced. Ends a hundreds of thousands of black families make it into the middle class every single year. I even Lou violence is still high. It doesn't need to be said that South Africa is quite a violent country. It has also been reduced further in general, the access to drinkable water, electricity and healthcare has also improved quite a lot. Do you illustrate the situation? South Africa is the biggest tourist center and its financial power in the south of the continent. It stock market is the most important in Africa. I did is also an important place for the automotive industry. Companies such as BMW and General Motors have factories out. So it all sounds pretty good, right? Well things today are not looking that rosie crises on stagnation, just licensed numerous achievements. The economy hasn't changed since 2009 the economy isn't growing. Unemployment rates, I'll one of the highest in the world and in general, very few people are working the country.

Speaker 1:          06:12          It has a population of about 55 million people, 50 million of which are without work and as many of the jobs that the people do have. Our informal, and this is not the only problem. Investment by companies has also kept a decreasing in the last nine years. It's currency. The rand is also greatly depreciate it and it's public debt is about to be declared as junk bonds. This is a pretty major economic disaster. In fact, in the last years people with money have begun leaving the country. So the big question is what happens in South Africa? What led to this crisis? This is Jacob Zuma. He's been in office since 2009 and his years in office have been, well, they've been a giant mess. My man is facing at 783 corruption cases and he has been described at being a professional ads taking things that are not his

Speaker 5:          07:02          South Africa's main opposition party is accusing President Jacob Zuma or of flagrant abuse of public money is a multimillion euro. Upgrades to his home. Additions to zoomers home include a swimming pool, cattle enclosure and an amphitheater.

Speaker 1:          07:19          This is not the only issue. Mr Zoom is political decisions don't encourage foreign investment. Further the president's labor regulations. There are an obstacle when it comes to job creation and the regulations are getting more and more rigid has last idea. It was a huge raise in the minimum wage. It's something that doesn't make a bunch of sense in a country where there are so few working people. In fact, many financial analysts have criticized the measure by saying it's nonsensical to establish a minimum wage, which amounts do twice as much as half of work as I'm making. Now, to be honest, we all do once our salaries to raise, but I think it's a better idea to create some wealth first if job creation was already an issue before, imagine what's going to happen with higher salaries and South Africa has other problems too and important. One is it's problematic education

Speaker 2:          08:02          system,

Speaker 1:          08:07          an awful education system. The education system in South Africa is pretty awful. Picture this one in every three students who has attended school for six years has difficulty when it comes to something as essential as reading and only one in every 100 black students gets an engineering diploma. So we can probably, no one understands why. National companies complain about the difficulty of finding skilled labor and this has got nothing to do with money. South Africa is one of the countries with the highest investments in education in the world.

Speaker 1:          08:42          The question is, what is happening? Well, according to some people, the ones who are to blame are the Democratic Teacher's Union. They control the state education system and it has become something of a Mafia. The union is an ally of President Zuma Zuma. Besides putting it into education supervision, there's also pulls many strings to get more teachers into the system. This is because the education level of teachers themselves to become a very low. Now, a few years ago, maths teachers in the country were given a task. These teachers were teaching math to 11 and 12 year olds. What was the result? Well, eight hours of these teachers got lower results and we're expected of their students and to be honest in maths is not exactly one of president zoom as strong suits. This is President Zuma attempting to say 769,817

Speaker 6:          09:26          769 800 ten seven hundred one property, 810 20

Speaker 2:          09:38          no

Speaker 1:          09:39          via sneak the results for white students. So you go to private schools are far better. This shows that maybe some of the apartheid heritage is still very much in a fact

Speaker 2:          09:50          race.

Speaker 1:          09:50          So conflict if these problems weren't bad enough. Racial conflict in South Africa has also been growing in the last few years. The economic freedom fighters is a radical political party that was founded in 2015 this party is an lv third largest force in the country. Some of its members are suggesting to almost inverted apartheid and plants and the white population. It is still a minority party, but is an element of subversion. It is working quite well. So anyway, it now it looks as if Mandela's dream, it's now in danger. So this is what we think here of Israel politic. But what do you think, do you think the South Africa will continue to pursue Nelson Mandela's dream? Do you think it will become the most prosperous nation in Africa? Once again, what'd you think? Hatred, distrust, and bad politics. We'll try and do. Let us know in the comments section below this video. We'd love to know what you think.
