Speaker 2:          00:08          one of the most surprising things about Japan, and there are many surprising things is quite how safe it is. [inaudible] Japan is one of the few countries in the world where you can leave an iphone 10 and a coffee shop and the only thing you've got to worry about is dropping by the next day to get it. Because to view it is only certain that your recently released brand new iphone 10 will be there waiting for you at the next

Speaker 1:          00:29          stay.

Speaker 2:          00:33          I'm not even exaggerating here. Also, Japan is a beautiful country with amazing sites where everything seems to be exactly where it should be. As you know, this is not a travel channel in this video is indeed not sponsored by Japan's Ministry of Tourism. So let us get right to the point yet.

Speaker 2:          01:01          Recently we will find out that emperor hito has decided to abdicate. The Emperor of Japan will step down on April 30th, 2019 the first application by a Japanese monarch in two centuries. Well, see, this emperor came to the throne almost 30 years ago in 1989 just when the great Japanese crisis again. So No. In Japan, the emperor has no power. So I can hito wasn't responsible, but don't say that. Can't be just coincidence and bad luck. We can practically say that it was off to Iquitos arrival that 30 years of stagnation began, and in this video we're going to see what happens, what caused this great crisis and why the German economic model has managed to defeat the Japanese model. But first, have you or let's have a small history. Lesson. Goals exists and Germany are two very interesting countries with a lot in common, and it's also many differences off to the Second World War. Both countries were literally in ruins. They had lost not only the infrastructure, but also an entire generation. However, despite this, between the 1950s in the 1970s both countries experienced such a powerful take off that in those two decades they not only managed to recover bus become two of the largest economies in the world as well as two of the richest country.

Speaker 2:          02:25          In fact, even though it might seem incredible, it's a day for years, it was speculated that Japan could surpass even the United States as the world's largest economy and oh, how things have changed says that between 1955 and 1973 Japan grew at an average rate of 9% a year and between 1973 and 1990 above 4% these are really, truly incredible rates and Germany didn't stay behind just as an average growth rate of 7% for almost 30 years.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Countries

Speaker 2:          02:58          where at full throttle, their factories works tirelessly. There was no unemployment and it's both Germans and the Japanese saved and invested their money all over the world. Suddenly Japanese and German companies became famous. World was very important, especially for Japan, a country that lives constantly under nature's threat.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Sorry,

Speaker 2:          03:23          it's being a very mountainous country. Japan suffers from all kinds of natural disasters, earthquakes, cyclin tsunamis, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Bye Bye.

Speaker 2:          03:32          In a future visual politic video, hit subscribe. Wait, going to tell you all about how these two economic miracles took place. Well. The fact is that in 1989 this entire economic takeoff stops. It came to an end and gave way to what is known as the great Japanese stagnation. Forget Greece. Japan has the world's real economic time. Buck Christopher Matthews, an axios reporter. I'm pretty convinced this isn't news to you as it isn't strange to hear people talk about Japan along with the word crisis. Since I can recall, Japan has been the country of eternal crisis, the country that has one good year for every three bad ones. In fact, nowadays we can easily declared Germany v winner in the growth rates that both countries maintained for decades today. Germany, which has also gone through some bad times in recent decades, is richer, has healthier public accounts, is more competitive internationally and has higher weight. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Yes.

Speaker 2:          04:35          No idea of Japan situation. I think we can use to very revealing facts first in Japan, real wages, which take into account inflation are lower today than salaries. Back in 1990 which was 30 years ago, seconds, the Japanese government's public debt is the highest in the world. 250% of GDP. Yes, we didn't screw that up. That is really the debt. So do you feel, you might be wondering, well what the hell happens? What made the German models so much better than the Japanese? Well, obviously there are lots of reasons, but we believe that three of them are by far the most important. So we're going to take a look at them, right?

Speaker 1:          05:14          No

Speaker 2:          05:20          problematic model.

Speaker 1:          05:23          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:24          First we can save that. There was a big difference between Japan and Japanese developments, the country of the rising sun opposite to protect a large industrial conglomerates of [inaudible]. They can read, so to speak, holdings the do practically everything that is, they have companies for all kinds of things, cause planes, tires, even toothpaste. Everything is manufactured by the same holding company whose companies support each other by and sell products between themselves and even have their own banks to finance themselves. So what's the problem this? Well, these large conglomerates tended to be very bureaucratic and not very flexible.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:04          So decision making was a very difficult and slow process, but the Japanese government decided to compensate them for all of these disadvantages and to didn't hesitate to give the Keiretsu all kinds of advantages and privileges. For example, Japan central bank finance them generously at abnormally low rates through specific programs. However, the results, they were not

Speaker 1:          06:24          good.

Speaker 2:          06:25          See these large groups became very influential in the country's politics. They also had many problems because of course when one of these conglomerates companies did badly, it was extremely easy for them to infect the rest. They were also in a lot of debt and they even limited common

Speaker 1:          06:38          tissue.

Speaker 2:          06:40          I mean how can one compete with such groups if they are also protected by the government and to have all kinds of privileges. It's a pretty hard thing to ask. On the other hands. In Germany the political commitments was completely different and focused on creating a very competitive market with small and medium sized company, all that large industrial ribs in Germany. Well of course there are and that's a good thing as long as they don't, depends on the government or receive privileges that impede competition. So while Germany's companies thrive to Japan's and large conglomerates have had many problems and most of disappeared or broken down at some point, but that's not all discount policy

Speaker 2:          07:30          is Japanese politicians thought that in order to export more, devaluing the currency from time to time was not a bad thing. However, in 1985 the real problems began. See as a result of all these currency wars, the United States gained a fairly large external deficits and because Washington politicians of the time, as they do now didn't like it, they forced the so called plaza record and agreements between the United States, Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom to depreciate the dollar to decrease the trade deficits. As you can imagine, this was a huge blow to the Japanese industry who was used to competing with a little bit of help and then the government is sank its interest rates and began boosting credit like there was no tomorrow

Speaker 1:          08:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:21          the result of this, well that was a huge debt spiral. Banks distributing money like crazy and a massive bubble in the real estate and financial markets. And you know what happened next? Well in 1990 this entire house of cards began to collapse in Germany. However, as we also saw here at visual politics, but governments opposite to maintain a strong mark that currency at the time, which on one hand forced companies to compete in productivity and innovation, but on the other allowed them to buy foreign technology and machines under better terms. But dear viewer, there is still a third ends determinant. Different

Speaker 1:          09:05          walked

Speaker 2:          09:06          within themselves.

Speaker 1:          09:09          Japan

Speaker 2:          09:10          is the most elderly country in the world, just over 25% of its population. That is everyone in for Japanese people are over 65 and for every hour that passes, the country's population drops by 50 people. The Japanese government expects the country's population to fall below 100 million people by the year 2050 and of course the more elderly citizens there are, the less young people there are in the liver, the population. This has clear consequences for one more public spending on pensions and healthcare and for another less

Speaker 1:          09:41          labor.

Speaker 2:          09:44          Many other countries have this problem, but Japan's case is by far the most serious. And this isn't by chance at all. Japanese companies. I've compensated for all of the problems caused by the bad policies that we talked about in this video. They forced their employees to work longer hours than in other developed countries, which obviously it leaves very little time to think about starting a family and what's more, what some countries like Germany have favored the arrival of immigrants who tend to have higher population growth rates. Japan has closed its doors.

Speaker 2:          10:18          In fact, when international organizations tell Japan that they have to open their borders to immigration to face the aging problem, the Japanese government's has even said this in Japan's finance minister tells elderly they should hurry up and die to help reduce countries rising welfare bill, sorry. These are the fundamental causes that have led Japan to live in continuous crisis and the courses that have made the German model clearly better than the Japanese one.
