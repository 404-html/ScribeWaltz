Speaker 1:          00:00          On this channel, we talk about politics. Are you prepared to accept the truth? Because that's what I'm going to tell these people are out to make your lives a living hell. You are fake news, okay? Okay, but not this kind of politics. In this channel, we want to know the why of politics and the why of economics. When the whole world needs your oil, you have all of the deal making power. We want to understand why some countries are poor. How did the government destroy the economy in such a short amount of time and how good politics can make good countries. Switzerland has one of the world's best political systems and we believe that this is the reason that they are successful and to understand how the world is changing. In other words, Estonia has invented a brands new concepts, the concept of liquid citizenship. In fact, this has nothing to do with the politics that you see in the traditional media. It's real. It's informative, it's visual or politic, and welcome to our channel.
