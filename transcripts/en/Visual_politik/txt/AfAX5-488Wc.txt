Speaker 1:          00:09          Isn't her douse the trade war is one of the hottest topics in international politics, payroll, visual, politic. We've already spoken about the consequences that this trade wall may have, which may already be having. However we should explore requestion. Many of you have already asked, especially through our patrion page, which is essential for analyzing this entire matter. Why does the United States have some shot at launch? Trade deficits, indeed this gigantic deficits, the past $550 billion dollars in 2017, and most importantly, how serious is it and how can it be fixed? While some of you might be thinking, well, that's easy, there's a trade deficit because the United States imports more than it exports among other things because of the evil unfair competition that has de industrialized the country. If we punish imports, the trade deficit will decrease, right? I mean after all, this is the stance of the White House president trump. Well, just a moment here because things aren't anywhere near as simple as this. Listen up the easy equation

Speaker 1:          01:17          one, choose, magnify and report problem, steps in place, a number on the table that we can all visualize. Step three, creates ends blaming enemy, whether it's real or not, it doesn't really matter. Step four, one, every one of the consequences of this problem and finally ends with a simple and electoral remedy. That is also false. Folks, these are the steps for creating a populist political discourse, a discourse that at the moment of truth maybe worth absolutely nothing but will certainly help you win elections. Well, that's exactly what the White House is doing with the aim of winning votes. They have created a political discourse that so to speak, is fundamentally based on eight, three elements. Equation, but do not worry. This has nothing to do with maths, at least not entirely. Seven's the trade deficit causes terrible damage. Seconds elements. This damages due to the other countries, unfair competition, especially China and third, the threat due to the other countries, bad behavior and the US as industry and power is falling apart.

Speaker 1:          02:24          However, folks, discourse is one thing and the reality is quite different. To magnify the problem, Donald Trump's commercial advises us again and again about the negative impacts that this whole trade deficits has on the North American economy today, so they use the accounting entity that you're seeing on the screen right now, which is one of the formulas used to calculate the GDP, the US GDP equals consumption plus investment plus public spending, plus exports minus imports. I mean there's really economics 101 here. Well the fact is that seeing it this way makes it look like the trade deficit is causing a huge amount of damage to the U s economy. And of course if the difference between exports and imports decreases, then the GDP would increase prosperity for everyone. Easy, right? Well hold on a second because this all implies simplifying things to the point where any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental. So why do I say this? Well, that's because relations with the rest of the world have a lot and I mean a lot of influence on the other sections that make up the GDP.

Speaker 2:          03:34          Are you listening

Speaker 1:          03:41          at the end of the day when a foreigner invests in the United States? So when US companies buy raw materials, capital goods, or intermediate goods, the effects on the economy, it's not exactly negative, it's quite the opposite. Actually. If for example, all these goods become expensive because of tariffs, then companies lose competitiveness. Heroin, visual politic. We've already talked, for example, about how terrorists have caused Harley Davidson to move its processes to Europe in a similar way, more expensive import products, which also affects the retail sector. So that in the end, the relationship of this supposed trade deficit with the GDP isn't as direct as it might at first seem. The second element of political discourse that the White House uses is that of unfair competition, especially in the case of China. And of course supposedly because of Beijing's bat actions, China's goods and services deficit alone exceeds $300,000,000,000 per year. And that's when from things, well, let's see if we decrease China's trade deficit, then problem solved, right? Well folks, things, they don't actually work that way either. First, this unfair competition is at the very least questionable. China has been blamed for manipulating its currency and that's just not really true. In fact, it's actually the opposite. In recent years, the Chinese yuan has risen a lot against the dollar and do you know what happened to the trade deficit with China? Went to Beijing, didn't devalue its currency to export more or they shot up?

Speaker 1:          05:18          Well, in reality, the US a trade deficit with East Asia in terms of manufactured goods, has been more or less constant since the mid nineties. What has changed is that what ones came from Taiwan or Japan among others now comes directly from China and it's because it's a great assembly center and that's precisely what fattens the US trade deficit with China quite so much. And regarding that last point is the one about deindustrialization and loss of competitiveness due to unfair competition. Well, it isn't true either. US exports, which remains the second largest exporter in the world are at record, just like industrial production. Check this out, I'm sorry, but China isn't devouring the American economy. Just a second then. If trump's arguments aren't true about the entire United States trade deficit, why is that such an imbalance? What are the real reasons for it? Well, listen to this, the real reasons you may be surprised to find out, but what caused the US trade deficit wasn't any country's unfair competition. This time the fault is all at higher. Yes, leaving the theories that speak of evil Chinese schemes to destroy the West might be less exciting, but I'm sorry. It's just the way things are.

Speaker 1:          06:54          The commercial whole is due to the low savings rate in the United States. The United States dollar is a reserve currency which makes it highly demanded and I have a values and then there's the huge amounts of capital that comes to the United States every year from abroad. For example, from China as we are going to see this is what explains why the United States spent more than 40 years. We have a trade deficit without the economy's suffering. Forty years in a row can, assuming more than it produces because folks, trump always talks about the trade balance but never talks about the financial balance and that's the trap.

Speaker 3:          07:27          $800,000,000,000 a year trade deficit with other nations unaccepted. They send the Mercedes, they sent bmw, they send everything

Speaker 1:          07:43          absolutely. Last game

Speaker 1:          07:47          and economic law that the US president seems to be unfamiliar with the balance of payments which measures the monetary transactions of a country with the exterior is always in equilibrium in a system of floating exchange rates like the one that exists nowadays. Allow me to explain that a bit further. When there's a trade deficits, it's basically compensated by capital or financial account surpluses, which more or less reflect the balance between the capital that arrives in the country and what leaves it. That's the money that comes in and the money that goes out. A persistent current account surplus is always balanced out by a capital account deficit. It's one of the eternal laws of economics like gravity and physics. Conrad poot sear a reporter at the real deal. Look at what happens precisely with the United States balance of payment

Speaker 4:          08:35          s. As you can

Speaker 1:          08:41          see, the trade deficit is offset by surpluses in the financial balances. Now, does this mean that a country can buy whatever it wants abroad without limits? Well, no, obviously not. It can only important if it manages to finance or for. It's important. We have capital that comes from abroad, otherwise first its currency would depreciate a lot, say pure law of supply and demand is high demand for foreign currency and offer local currency, and then eventually the foreign currency reserves of the central bank would dry up on leashing and exchange crisis. This is something that in Latin America, especially in Argentina, is very well known.

Speaker 1:          09:19          Well. All right, so what happens in the U s case? Well, America is the greatest refuge for capital on the entire planet. Therefore, every year, huge amounts of capital and so the country practically half of the world's savings spent investing in this country, either his loans direct foreign investment all by buying shares on this, etc. Have you noticed, for example, the impressive run that the snp 500 has had over the last nine years? Well, it's precisely that enormous capital flow arriving every year to the United States that allows americans to consume more than they produce, which despite in carrying commercial deficits for more than 40 consecutive years, has led the country to practically always find employments and record levels of exports and industrial production. Considering tHat we can understand things like this, whether it's Japan in the 19 eighties, Germany, and the two thousands or China in recent years, countries that invest heavily in the New York real estate market also tend to have a massive trade surplus with the United States. Conrad puts sierra, a reporter at the real deal. Basically thanks to the capital that comes from abroad to the United States can afford to consume more than it produces, so in addition to exporting goods and services, the United States also export's financial securities. This is the key, but wait, does this need that? The fiscal deficits combi reduced actually not at all.

Speaker 1:          10:49          How to decrease the commercial

Speaker 4:          10:51          set.

Speaker 1:          10:53          As you can see, sometimes things aren't as they seem at fest. Having a trade deficit doesn't have to be bad. After all, the ultimate economic objective must be to improve living conditions. That is the ability to consume more and the better goods and services. Yes, a bulky and continuing trade deficits. It can have some drawbacks. For example, assumes more risk or risk that capital will stop flowing towards the country, which could lead to a huge crisis. And for another, it favors debt growth. The country flooded with money from abroad. That means abundant and cheap money and he doesn't want money. So let's continue with the key question here. How can Donald Trump decrease the us trade deficit? Well, there are mainly three options too that we should set aside and it's one that's highly recommend. Those we did recommends would be either agreeing to devalue the dollar and stop it from being the hegemonic currency of the world with the federal reserve. So importance would be much more expensive and nobody would want to take their money to thiS couNtry or the u. S could restrict the caPital coming from abroad, for example, through taxes. Of course, that in the long run is also going to be a disaster

Speaker 1:          12:09          because the other option, the one that we'd recommend is consuming less, saving more favoring productive investments. That way fewer foreign lines would be demanded and much more wealth would be generated so that it's in percentage terms over the gdp. Trade deficits would be much smaller. And to achieve this goal, stopping the government's growing fiscal hold would be a fantastic idea. But trump, despite what he's saying, is going in the opposite direction, it would also be a fantastic option to allow american companies to fill the nearly 6 million vacant jobs that the north american economy suffers from today by bringing in professionals from abroad.

Speaker 1:          12:45          However, protectionist policies don't work first because all the other countries tend to respond to tariffs with their own tariffs, which reduces imports, but also exports and most importantly, because the increased costs led by terrorists make the United States and less attractive country to invest in, and that's in the longterm. It's a really bad thing. Perhaps folks, the strongest proof that american companies need to be open to the world is found in the trump family itself. See ivanka trump, the president's daughter and white house special advisor, has just closed her clothing and accessories brands. Ivanka made this decision after suffering a steep drop in sales and a huge amount of criticism for some alleged contradictions. And do you know why she was criticized? Well, can you guess where she wants to making products? I mean, surely in the United States rights. Well, no, actually wrong. The correct answer was China.

Speaker 1:          13:38          Most of our products are made in China and also in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia has ivanka trump has self been an accomplice of the evil entities that have been attacking the United States.
