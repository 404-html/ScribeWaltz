Speaker 1:          00:08          In 1991, after several years of negotiations in a whole lot of tension, the Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, I finally managed to break away from the Soviet Union. They finally have the freedom that they've wanted for so then 50 years have passed since the soldiers of the Red Army occupying these countries. During the years under the Soviets. Repression and fear were the basic ingredients in the lives of the people in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Let's now have a look at some pretty alarming data. In Lithuania alone, a country of little more than two point 5 million people. These numbers were recorded.

Speaker 2:          01:03          200,000 people were arrested, questioned and imprisoned. One hundred and 32,000 people were deported, especially to Siberia. Seventy 5,000 prisoners, deportees and partisans were eliminated by the Soviet regime

Speaker 1:          01:19          and of all of that wasn't enough at the time of their independence. Poverty and shortages were everyday. Reality is for all of the inhabitants of these countries.

Speaker 2:          01:29          I remember the days when the counters at the shops and to Lynn were empty and the people were starving. Economy, more or less had to be rebuilt from scratch.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Since then, if you have things have changed a lot more than I lost. In fact, from the very moment these countries regains their independence, they decided to bet it's all on democracy and freedom. They were calling me today, some of the freest ones. They are members of the EU and NATO and they prosper today. These are countries with very high standards of living and they can really be considered rich countries. The transformation it really has been total and remark

Speaker 3:          02:09          that

Speaker 1:          02:10          they suffered along with the rest of the world is through the financial crisis and it really seemed as if their economies were on the verge of collapse.

Speaker 2:          02:20          Economy contracts almost 18 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009,

Speaker 1:          02:24          but against all odds, they manage to recover in a very short period of time. Indeed, they became an example to other countries like Spain, Greece, and Portugal, but that's a whole different thing that we're going to talk about being the future video. In this video, we're going to focus on Lithuania and talk about a problem that is shared by a lot of the countries in eastern Europe. I problem that today is actually one of the biggest threats to them.

Speaker 3:          02:48          Future brain drain

Speaker 1:          02:58          history of Lithuania. All of the Baltic states in general since their freedom in 1991. Well, it's a history of success today. They are modern open countries with prosperous economies. As with any good story. Not Everything is quite so pretty. Yes. That all issues these countries are facing and today we're going to particularly focus on Lithuania in this country. The biggest problem is brain drain. Yep. That's emigration with an e and this is no small problem for the country.

Speaker 3:          03:27          Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:28          Since 2004, when the country was integrated into the EU, mania has lost more than 10 percent of its population. That is more than 300,000 people, especially young people have decided to pack up and move to a different country. Most of those have chosen to move to the United Kingdom.

Speaker 3:          03:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:47          While in western Europe and the United States, they aren't concerned about immigration in Lithuania. It is the other way around. They are concerned about people leaving. They are worried that this might end up capitalizing the company.

Speaker 2:          04:01          Nineteen 90. We have lost about 800,000 people in for a small country. This is a huge loss. We're losing our youngest and brightest and in the future we'll just have old people who will be dying. We will have a dying society

Speaker 1:          04:14          and there's always the ones who are leaving tend to be the most capable and best prepared to young people. There's, of course has a significant impact on the country's economy. The number of young people working decreases talent leaves the country and as the population ages, but this is not just a problem for Lithuania.

Speaker 2:          04:36          The early 19 nineties, some $20 million of central and eastern Europe's most talented workers have left and they have headed largely to western Europe.

Speaker 1:          04:43          So who do you think has benefited from all of this? Talent redistribution. Yup. You got that right. It's the wealthiest countries and that is why we have to be careful about the messages being sensed by politicians who are attempting to criminalize immigration in order to get votes. Yes, we're looking at you to reason me and Donald Trump, but I mean I know what you're thinking. If the Baltic countries have been so successful, why are people leaving? Well because they all looking out for their own personal success. For one, these countries have managed to develop a well prepared young population who can also speak English to you must haves when it comes to looking for a future in another place and then we also have the fact that because of all the growth that has happened since 1991, these people that can now leave the country in a comfortable way, but there is still the key questions you want sell. Why are they leaving if things aren't going so well? Well, that's not really that hard to explain.

Speaker 3:          05:42          No

Speaker 2:          05:43          salaries have improved a lot in the last several years. The difference between the wealthiest countries is still quite big. As an example, while the average salary in Lithuania is about 800 euros in United Kingdom, it is almost 2,500 euros or three times more.

Speaker 1:          06:00          All of this. Well, I might leave you wondering whether this impressive economic developments was actually good for the Baltic countries. Well, we would say that overall, yes, it's certainly worth it's, but it does leave us with a couple of very important questions. Well, the first one is what is the cost of all of this and seconds, how can they stop? The brain

Speaker 3:          06:18          drank

Speaker 2:          06:21          putting an end to emigrate.

Speaker 3:          06:22          Sure.

Speaker 1:          06:24          So stopping this brain drain, it's become a pretty major priority for Eastern European countries. Some of these countries like Poland, Latvia, and Hungary, they have started a return campaign in order to persuade immigrants to come back home.

Speaker 2:          06:38          Welcome all Polish people who went abroad. If only they could come back, it would be a great day for Poland.

Speaker 3:          06:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:46          However, while this, it's a nice sentiment. It is definitely in Lithuania where there is a larger concern about the brain drain that the has been more significant support from society.

Speaker 2:          07:01          The last parliamentary elections celebrated in October. The Lithuanian Greens and Farmers Union won the elections and took control of the government. Is pinterest party had only one MP in the previous elections. Their main promise, putting an end to immigration,

Speaker 1:          07:19          but well, of course this is easier said than done, so the question is how is this party going to succeed? Policy, leds, by the way, by Ramina Cabal Skus, one of the most important businessmen in the country, well apparently their top priority is to stop immigration by attracting much more foreign investments. They claim that if they can succeed in getting more foreign money for investment, they will be able to provide a more jobs with higher salaries so well, how are they planning to do this well, by reducing bureaucracy, chasing corruption, and also by making adjustments to the labor markets. And the truth is that this does make a ton of sense and we could say that the Baltic countries really do seem to know how to get things done. Let's hold on for just a second because this. It's not the end of the story. There are some other things that, well, they don't look quite so good.

Speaker 2:          08:10          The shadows of the Lithuanian plan

Speaker 1:          08:13          on the one hands. At the same time as the government promised foreign investments, they have also committed to raise taxes by eliminating what is known as a flat tax look in Lithuania as well as in Estonia and not be at the tax systems. Really symbol in Lithuania case. There is this flat tax which is a rate of 15 percent for people and companies. That is to say that the Lithuanian who makes $10,000 pays $1,500 in taxes, was the one who makes 10 times more at 100,000 euros, also pays 10 times more, read 15,000 euros. Raising taxes in this way sort of goes against the foreign investments and higher salaries plan and this rise will direct harm both of those things, and by the way, corporate taxes, they're not as low as they might seem.

Speaker 2:          08:54          If we up the social

Speaker 1:          08:56          security contributions and other taxes, companies pay more than 40 percent of their gross profits in taxes according to the World Bank. Now, we also have to point this out. The issue of Russia and NATO, the previous Lithuanian governments and the current is no exception. I've insisted on scaring the population and also the rest of the world with the Russian threat thing that the country is constantly in danger.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Okay. Now, while it is true that the threats are real, it's not really a brilliant way to instill confidence in potential investors, and finally, and maybe most importantly of all, that is a cultural matter that affects the entire country. So you might want to write if this, this brain drain going on, wouldn't it be logical to try and compensate for this by bringing in young professionals from other countries? Well, that's kind of a problem because this country, it's also a bit suspicious about immigration. Most of these countries, a touch nationalist anyway, if anything is full session, is that Lithuania is rather this stonier in Latvia have done their homework and is that policies are certainly much more efficient than the ones that predominate in the rest of Europe. Remember, in 25 years they have managed to become rich countries with higher standards of living. Well, now we'd like to know what you think. Do you think these countries will finally be able to stop this brain drain?
