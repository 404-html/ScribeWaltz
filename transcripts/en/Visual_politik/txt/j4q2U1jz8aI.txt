Speaker 1:          00:09          Why are some countries rich and others pour? I mean, it sounds like an easy question, but nothing could be further from the truth. There in fact is the origin of wealth is one of the key issues. If north of the most important issue in political debates,

Speaker 2:          00:22          they're three and a half million more women living in poverty today, the one that president took office. We don't have to live like this. I want to give middleclass families and folks who were striving to give the middle class some leaf,

Speaker 1:          00:35          all the poor countries poor because there are rich countries. Do the richest countries have any special geographical characteristics that determine their success? Oh, natural resources for source of wealth, ah, their inhabitants smarter or most importantly of all, is there some limited amount of wealth that we simply have to distribute?

Speaker 3:          00:54          What does,

Speaker 1:          01:05          if you, if the answer to all of those questions was a yes, then we could say that our luckiest set and we simply can't change it. If we're rich, great, and if we're poor, apparently there are only two paths. Either we quits or we put our trust in some sorts of Messianic leader who promises us some kinds of revolution. Of course, these revolutions, well, they almost always ends up making things much worse.

Speaker 2:          01:30          [inaudible] Rico said, I know, but just all during my mind,

Speaker 1:          01:36          I actually think that this approach is missing something melt. Honestly, I think it's missing rather, and lots of things. Obviously folks, many factors determine whether a country is rich or whether it is porn, and in this video we're going to focus on one of the factors. In fact, probably one of the most important issues of all, we'll will do so by taking a look at the history of the entire American continent. So listen up America versus America.

Speaker 3:          02:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:09          America one consonance, two very different realities. Some countries are very rich and others very poor. For example, check out Canada's park capita income, even taking a price difference into account. It is five times that of El Salvador or Ecuador. Then consider the fact that the per capita income in the U S is four times higher than it is in Columbia. Yes, it's true. And there's also a group of countries that we could describe in relative terms as sort of middle class. We've got Chili and Panama. The income is three times that of Bolivia and almost double that of Peru.

Speaker 4:          02:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Broadly speaking, of the 1 billion people living in the America is approximately 40% lift in some of the richest countries in the world, mainly the United States and Canada. Meanwhile, the other 60% of Americans live in countries that are either very poor or are still developing and of course faced with this panorama. The question is, why on earth is there such a contrast between for two great North American powers under the rest of the consonants or even why are the countries located at both ends of the continents? January richer? Well, just check out this map. The countries that are painted with a darker color, Richard.

Speaker 4:          03:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:32          However, it may be easier to notice the enormous difference writes on the board of that. You're seeing donald trump's favorite border, of course, the one between the United States and Mexico on the north side of the border. We do have the u s one of the wealthiest countries in the world. I come three where in general its inhabitants are much richer and it's much safer and they live longer lives than those on the southern side of the border. Those who live in Mexico, in fact one crosses the border and suddenly everything changes. Right.

Speaker 4:          04:06          Bye.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Why such a difference? Well, because at the end of the day we're talking about territories that have a very similar population and its natural resources. Don't forget that much of California, Texas and New Mexico, some of these states, which by the way are the most prosperous and innovative in the United States when Mexican at the beginning of the 19th century.

Speaker 4:          04:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:28          Yeah. And the people that you manage to cross from south of the border to the north have quite high employment and entrepreneurship rates. So of course we're not talking about racial or religious motives. Yeah. Then why on earth does this huge contrast exist between the north and the south of the border? Well, you might be thinking right now that obviously it's because they've had worse governments and worse politicians, but I mean, where did that come from? Did almost all the countries south of the u s Mexico border just simply have this sort of bad luck? Is that not another factor involved? Well, listen up here, different destinations Devi, you are to continue in the video today, we really need to take a small trip. We need to go back to the year 1600 imagine there are two brothers, John and his pizza who, or a balanced, we embark on the American adventure from some European pause. However, due to fate, they ended up on different books.

Speaker 3:          05:29          Okay?

Speaker 1:          05:29          One of the brothers, John left in such a fortune in Mexico, while pizza got on a ship that was heading farther north to what later became known as New England's and today corresponds to the states. If New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, and Rhode Island.

Speaker 3:          05:44          Okay?

Speaker 1:          05:45          And you might be picking it up now, but this is indeed one of the richest areas in the United States. Now, the question is, if you'd been in these two brothers places, which ship would you have preferred? The one that was going to Mexico or the one that was to New England's to Boston? Well, viewer, for those of you who answered Boston, I think you should rather reconsider your decision at the time. Things they couldn't have been more different. You see, John, he arrived in Mexico City, a city full of monuments in new buildings, a city that had nothing to envy from European cities, but that's how I'm, Mexico was part of the vice royalty of new Spain, an area of expensive governance that was full of wonders, cultivated fields, ancient civilization ruins large cities, et Cetera, et cetera. But Peta, he arrived in a cold, desolate, unpopulated area, a place without infrastructure where mere survival was something of a challenge. It was a place where real hunger and true cold, we're raging. Actually the Spanish conquerors didn't move further north because there was no wealth to extract that

Speaker 5:          06:49          chose North America. Not because it was attractive, but because it was all that was available, but desirable parts of the Americas where the indigenous population to exploit was plentiful and where the gold and silver mines were located had already been occupied. The English got the leftovers, Darren, Asimo, Lou and James Robinson. Why nations fail

Speaker 1:          07:09          in New England, one how to work very hard just to survive in the south. However things they were difference, there were many natural riches. The climate's was much better for agriculture and so there was a large local population used by the Spanish conquistadores to do endless hours of work in exchange for practically nothing.

Speaker 1:          07:31          The fact is that all of these resources, man, so that many of those who arrived didn't have to work in order to survive, and not only that, many of the institutions that existed in old Europe could be easily replicated. These were institutions like the aristocracy and bureaucracy. That is the officials or the royal favors, which were privileges granted by the state and to which benefits is only a select few. These include things like commercial monopolies, land distribution, mining, exploitation, et cetera. That way. That's all by Lisel. On the one hand, a culture was born in which work and entrepreneurship. We're not perceived as the best way to prospect. Instead, people just needed to make good connections with those who were in power. I mean, why risk investing when you can just hold out your hand for a handout and then on the other hands in elite class was formed by people who lived based on the resources that others extracted. They lived through privileges, forced exploitation of the natives, lans, distribution, concessions, public revenues, taxes, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          08:29          This was an elite class by the way, which based on the standards of the time lived at full speed, which meant having to extract more and more resources from the others. This meant that this elite group that's controlled the economic resources not only to, didn't have to worry about investing, innovating or taking risks, they actually placed obstacles for other people and give you this culture. It didn't disappear with independence. It simply remains consolidating some of the most remarkable characteristics of Latin America and elite class with a lot of wealth that is based on obtaining wrens overlords, a lot of bureaucracy, and they shattered social elevator. Meanwhile, in the north, things were going completely differently.

Speaker 3:          09:15          The survival

Speaker 1:          09:20          unlike was happens in the south of the north, had no resources and no indigenous population to exploit it, so there was no other option, but to work hard, invest and innovate in order to improve the standard of living. Yeah. Thus the social climate and the institutions that were developed were very, very different. Physical hard work was well regarded and not only that, because since these territories were very poor and practically depopulated, they had a lot of political and economic autonomy. Actually at first, the British crown didn't really care much about these colonies. They were more concerned about what was happening in other parts of the empire where things were more lucrative. In fact, it was only when these colonies begins a prosper that the crown that started to pay attention to them. This means that the crown began to establish political and economic controls as well as introduced taxes. And as we all know, the settlers didn't take that lying down. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          10:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:15          See, it's often said that the u s war of independence was a fight to obtain freedom. However many of the incentives that led them to fight it more to do with maintaining the freedom, but they were already used to and which they were no longer willing to give up

Speaker 1:          10:33          once they obtained their independence. They worried a lot about making sure that neither of their liberties nor that entrepreneurial capacities were at risk. But some of you might be thinking right now, well Simon, hold on a minute because the offer guessing about slavery. Well, actually I'm not because the slave states, they weren't actually the richest slavery enriched a few at the great expense of others. Of course, if instead we talked about two companies instead of two brothers in the long term, it would have been much better to invest in the one in Boston. The keys to development. They don't lie in the natural resources of a country or in the exploitation of anyone. They lie in ingenuity, entrepreneurial spirit, and in work. That's why when politicians make this process difficult, for example, with taxes, a strong state, lots of bureaucracy or privileges for their friends, the results that are always really bad in a way, it's similar to what happens with the natural resources. They can help, but they aren't enough to generate real wealth because they're all very rich. Countries that hardly have any natural resources like Japan or Singapore and others with many resources but are incredibly poor like Venezuela. Ingenuity, work and capital are more important than any natural resource.

Speaker 3:          11:50          Good. The good news

Speaker 1:          11:51          here is that poverty, it's not, and you can't escape it. Trajectories such as those seen in countries like Chile or Panama or in recent decades showing with that things absolutely can change, but always the, and do you think we'll soon see an economic takeoff in Latin America?
