Speaker 1:          00:07          If you to invest your money in another country, I'm sure Venezuela wouldn't even be on the list. Rice wells, if you a government, it does not agree with it. China agrees to invest $20, million dollars in Venezuela to help offset effects of oil price slump. But hold on just a second because this is not only about China. Have you ever heard of Goldman Sachs? It's one of those banks that symbolizes American capitalism at its purest. Well, they too saw a lot of business opportunity as in Madeira. Venezuela buys two point $8,000,000,000 worth of Venezuelan bonds and an uproar begins. Yes, you heard that right. While Venezuela is having one of the worst economic catastrophes humanity has ever witnessed, they keep making deals with the world's biggest investors. This is why, despite the scarcity, the extreme poverty and the hyperinflation, Nicolas Maduro is buying state of the art weapons do maintain an army that almost nobody could attack. And Amit, that has over 1000 rockets that were manufactured in Russia in October of this year. That's 2017. Madeira met Vladimir Putin to buy weapons.

Speaker 2:          01:19          Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Meanwhile, at Venezuela is also the biggest partner that China has in the region they ever received, way more trainees money than any other Latin American country. All right, so now you might be wondering, well, what's the point of all of this? Well, finance wise, China is pretty blinds to ideology and the same goes for those American banks. The only goal is to make money, but at first sight and in Venezuela it doesn't exactly look like a great place to do business. How did Venezuela come to the attention of so many investors? I mean, where is the deal here? Well, today we are going to answer all of those questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history. Okay, so here's some advice. If you ever wanted to become a dictator in your country and repress your opinions and torture, you'll many political foes. That is something you absolutely need, and yes, of course that is money. Yeah, normal citizens can die from starvation, but your beliefs and your army cannot miss a single payday. This is the biggest problem for an authoritarian leader like Nicolas Maduro. The Venezuelan presidents, his biggest problem is if the army decides to striking

Speaker 2:          02:33          against

Speaker 1:          02:39          following visual politic for a long time, you know that Venezuela has almost no private company is say there's not much money to be collected in taxes for the oil exports are no longer profitable since the oil prices went down in 2012. In other words, his only way to pay for this whole repressive apparatus is by getting loans on the international market.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Hold on just a second here because things are not as easy as they seem. Venezuela is a country with terrible economic problems. This means if you lend them money, chances are you're never going to get it back. This is why we say the Venezuelan bonds are a very high risk investments as well, but to countries do when investors don't trust them. Well, they raised the interest rates and this is why Venezuelan bonds have a yield of over 10 and 12 percent while a German bonds, which is way more reliable. It doesn't surpass zero point five percent. All right, so what does all of this means? Let's imagine we invest a thousand US dollars in Venezuelan bonds to be paid in 10 years with an interest of 10 percent. Theoretically, the Venezuelan government is expected to give us back those thousand dollars that we lead them, but in the meantime you'll receive $100 every year as an interest payment. Well, yes, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. That sounds like a pretty great business. Well, do you notice, get excited just yet. As we said before, Venezuela has a pretty high chance of default. If the governments of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela declares bankruptcy and say two years, we're going to have lost 80 percent of our investments. This is why despite the high interest rates, Nicolas Maduro has founded harder and harder to sell his bombs. Amds well, this explains news like this.

Speaker 2:          04:28          Goldman Sachs,

Speaker 1:          04:28          it's Venezuela, bond purchase sparks anger. It paid about $865,000,000 for two point $8,000,000,000 worth of bonds. All right, so what does this mean? Well, it means Goldman Sachs bought Venezuelan bonds for a third of their value. In other words, theoretically the government of Venezuela is expected to pay back two point $8,000,000,000 to Goldman Sachs despite the fact that they only paid $865 million US dollars for them, and so now you might be wondering, well, why does Venezuela accept this deal? Well, the answer is simply because they need cash or they needed as soon as possible. Second, they also know they're never going to happen

Speaker 2:          05:07          right

Speaker 1:          05:12          now. You might be wondering, well, why did bank is lend them the money? If they know they're not going to get it back? Whereas the business appeal here, so basically this appeal bias and interest rates, I mean, think about it. If Venezuela against Goldman Sachs, 10 percent of those two point 8 billion every year, and that means the bank will have covered that investments, those $865 million dollars in less than three years, and after that, everything is profit. Now of course, investors know that Venezuela is going to default.

Speaker 2:          05:43          The

Speaker 1:          05:43          question here is when are they going to do it? So investors are making a high risk that yet it found a swale. It keeps paying for at least four years. Banks will win if they don't, the banks will lose. And the truth is, Nicolas Maduro is the first one interested in not bankruptcy. On the one hand, he needs to keep bankers on his side so he can pay his repression. Machinery. On the other hand, PDV s, a Venezuela's state owned oil company has several properties abroad, trees and refineries in countries like Haiti and the Dominican Republic. If Caracas defaults, some of those investors might seize them. This is white. For several years, Venezuela has prioritized that debt payments over anything else. Maduro is foreign. Currency reserves went from more than $50, billion dollars to less than 10 billion. And this explains why a magazine like Forbes said this about Venezuelan bonds in 2016

Speaker 2:          06:38          steam.

Speaker 1:          06:42          Venezuela might be the worst country in Latin America, but it's bonds look great. In the middle of 2017, Donald Trump had to pass a law banning American banks and hedge funds from investing in Venezuela. Nonetheless, no matter how badly maduro tried, his economy was weaker than he thought. Venezuela to restructure foreign debt default looms as possibility. Yes, you had that right. Goldman Sachs and the rest of those hedge funds who bought a Venezuelan bonds at a discount price, they've lost their best. Nonetheless. That is still one investor that is far from being worried and yes, of course we're talking about China. China's puppet as we said at the beginning, Venezuela is the country that received the most Chinese money in Latin America. This, unlike the private bankers, China's government does not buy bonds on

Speaker 2:          07:34          markets.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Instead she drink thing as a personal meeting with Nicolas Maduro and meeting where they negotiated a very special deal alone that is not to be paid back with money, but with oil this way. Beijing makes sure they have an oil supplier, no matter what happens, but all of them. A second tip, because this formula, it's got its drawbacks too. As you know, PDVSA is a hyper bureaucratic company with thousands of workers, hard by Chavez, out of pure nepotism.

Speaker 1:          08:09          Oil drilling is harder and harder for them. In fact, they need those dinosaur juice shipments are arriving pretty late to China, but despite all of that, China keeps them loyalty to Venezuela. That was showing solidarity with the Venezuelan people because we are supporting the principals of the United Nations. This is what we have to do that. So now the question becomes, well, why? What does China get from Venezuela now that they are facing problems with that while payments? Well, the answer lies in the long run. Just think about it. Beijing has already lent $50, billion dollars to crack us. Now they just need patients and stability.

Speaker 2:          08:50          Missouri Madeira

Speaker 1:          08:52          needs some years to pay back. Is that? Well, no rush project Mangan waste. However, that is something that could risk the payback of these debts and that is changing governments. What would happen if the opposition to Nicolas Maduro took power? Would they be willing to meet their obligations? Do they use you? It helps the dictator, the one who sent them to jail and probably tortured them. Sounds like a pretty risky proposition. Nan's well, risk is the least favorite word for the Chinese Communist Party and it explains things like this

Speaker 1:          09:24          that is really defends purchase of Chinese right control gear. After more than 70 deaths in street protests, China has already sold over $350, million dollars worth of weapons to Madeira so that he can stay in power. Thanks to things movements. Caracas is China's biggest ally in the region. Basically the Venezuelan government is to become the puppets of the Chinese Communist Party. So well. What happens? Well, maybe China wants to build new infrastructure in South America so they can complete that Silk Road project. While no problem, I'm in Venezuela. Diplomats will support them with no questions asked. Maybe China wants to have a military base in the region. Well, welcome to Venezuela, just like that. They'll get thousands of square miles to place that Ami as they please. In other words, well, there isn't a better ally than the one that needs you in order to survive. Venezuela hopes no country hinders China's fantastic Silk Road initiative. Nonetheless, that instilled dapcep having as much power as they have. China might request other kinds of reforms. For instance, if Venezuela that keeps facing problems with that oil payments, they might force maduro too for people at PD vsa and make it more productive. That could even take over the exploitation of the old themselves.

Speaker 2:          10:38          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          10:39          The question here is, can Venezuela become China's colony? Do you think China is going to seize Venezuelan oil forever?
