Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          Pearson is kind of like your boss. You don't like him, you don't trust him. But yeah, absolutely do need him to pay your bills. Now, it's been a long time since we talked about Putin here on visual politic and I know what you're thinking now.

Speaker 1:          00:24          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Again, Simon, and we rarely gonna talk about oil. I mean do it to death. Why don't you, well actually this time we're not talking about oil. Exactly. We're talking about natural gas. Now, many of you might think that these are actually very similar things because at the end of the day, countries with oil reserves usually have gas reserves too, but there is a difference. Oil markets are way more diversified. For example, Europe obeys 30% of their crude oil from Russia, but when it comes to the gas, then number rises to 40% but if we look at each individual European country, the dependency is way higher. Germany imports 60% of their gas from Russia and other countries like Finland in the Baltics depends entirely on Russian gas. In other words, Putin could leave these countries freezing on a cold, cold wind tonight. That would honestly make game of thrones look kind of like Baywatch. Hold on a minute here because there's more to this resource than heating in facts. We need natural gas for many of the things. In fact, domestic and assumption is just a third of the

Speaker 1:          01:32          total

Speaker 2:          01:36          as you can see on this chart. Another third is for thermal power plants, but the biggest share is used by various industries. For example, a paper manufacturing company needs thermal energy. This means heat in order to get this eat. The factory uses gas and the same goes for many, many other industries. In other words, gas is extremely important to everybody and that includes Europe and now can you guess who is the biggest consumer of gas in all of Europe? Yup, of course that would be Germany, the most populous country on the continent and also the one with the largest economy, and this is the key to our story because as long as Germany remains so dependent on Russia, all of Europe is going to depend on Russia too. And this is why during the 2018 NATO summit, Donald Trump said things like this,

Speaker 3:          02:26          Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they were getting from 60 to 70% of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline, and you'd tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not then. I think it's a very bad thing for NATO.

Speaker 2:          02:40          All right, so the question today is trump, right when he criticizes Germany, is it really a problem that Germany has such a high dependency on Russian gas and more importantly, is there a true attempt to reduce that dependency? Well, today we're going to answer all of those questions, but as always, before we do last, take a look back at the history

Speaker 2:          03:06          man in Berlin, there are two ways of transporting gas. The cheapest one is through a pipeline. This means we build a huge pipe that goes from the place we take the gas, see the Yamal peninsula in Russia to the country that buys it. For example, Germany. This is very cheap because, yeah, just need to build the pipelines. There you go. There's no need for trucks. There's no need for ships. This, nothing like that. Since you transport the gas through the pipes, it comes to the power plants, the houses and the factories all directly. There is also an alternative method though, and that's so called liquified natural gas or l and g.

Speaker 2:          03:48          So how does this work? Well, let's say we take our guests from cutoff. What we do is we lowered its temperature until it's 161 Celsius below zero. This is the point when the gas becomes liquid and you can store it in bottles. These bottles can then be stored on a ship and sent to say Barcelona in Spain there they have a regassification plants where they heat to the liquid until it becomes gas again. The gas thing goes to the national pipe network and that's when it's transported to houses and factories and things like that. So what's the advantage of this process? Well, it allows Europe to diversify their gas providers easily. But what's the problem? Uh, it's 50 to 70% more expensive than using those pipelines. We mentioned previously, and this, this is why European countries buy their gas from the closest to producers that were using pipelines. For example, the biggest supplier of Spain is Algeria, but the northern countries, they buy gas from Norway and especially Russia. As we said before, countries like rough snaps or luke, I'll export more than half of the gas consumed in Germany and this, well, what about the country is located between Germany and Russia? Well, they haven't even deeper dependency. Just have a look at this. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:00          Wow.

Speaker 2:          05:05          Pay Attention. You'll see how Poland depends on Russian gas. The 75% of its needs. Other countries like Finland is in Romania. They go all the way up to 100%. In other words, half of Europe needs Russia in order to simply survive, and this is no secret. The European Commission, they know about it and believe me, Vladimir Putin knows about it too.

Speaker 3:          05:28          Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course. Here in the Western Hemisphere. We are committed to maintaining our independence from the encroachment of expansionist foreign powers. But

Speaker 2:          05:50          let's pause the video here for just a moment. Right here we can see the German delegation laughing at trump. He just said that will become totally dependent on Russian energy. This means if they were already dependence, they will become even more dependence. So what is he talking about exactly? Well, let's rewind the video. Remember this name? Gerhard schrader. Here's the former German chancellor, the predessessors of Angela Merkel. He still maintains a massive influence in German and European politics and well, what does he do now? Well, actually he's building v

Speaker 1:          06:37          former,

Speaker 2:          06:37          no chief rest Mohsen Germany walks into Putin's trap, Nord Stream two basically Nord stream two is a brand new pipeline, but we're to go under the Baltic Sea connecting Germany with Russia with no middle man with this new pipeline, Germany could double the import of Russian gas. Since this project has a shareholder committee with companies like the Russian giant Gazprom and the presidents of this committee is of course Mr. Schroeder. If this isn't enough. The former German chancellor is also the president of Ross. NAFSA rational. Yeah. This is wine. The last 10 years, Schroeder has become Putin's man in Europe. In fact, he has defended Russia in all kinds of matters from the cyber attacks against the Estonian governments do the Crimean invasion. In other words, far from reducing that dependence on Russia. Germany is giving him the opposite direction. So what were those Germans laughing about? Honestly, I don't have any idea, but all right. All right. I know what you're thinking right now. What was the problem with depends on quite so much on Russia. Maybe it's because Putin's an authoritarian ruler, but seriously it's not because if that was the case or where else would we buy gas from? I mean the other list of suppliers includes as a [inaudible], Algeria and Qatar, which of course we all know a healthy democracy is governed by wonderful people. Bullock. The reality is no one really gives a shit about democracy and human rights when it comes to having heating in [inaudible]. Now, the problem with defending on Russia is something else and that's something you're going to understand right now.

Speaker 2:          08:18          Russia holics in Leah, 2006 Gazprom ones at the Ukrainians to pay six times more for gas in. This was a 100% political move for decades. Russia and Ukraine had this really good relationship and then the orange revolution began when Victor Yushchenko came to power with his auntie Russian and pro European rhetoric. The Kremlin essentially said this or I Ukraine. Well, if you want to go and hang out with your cool European friends and forget about us, well get your wallet out because it's going to be expensive. I think about it. Building a brand new pipeline with another country, it takes years, so Ukraine, they just couldn't find a new supplier overnight if booths in one sense, he could raise prices at well, men's, if you crane doesn't want to pay us well, Russia or we'll just close the pipe

Speaker 4:          09:07          for three days in the middle of a cold wave, Ukrainians had no heating at home and after a tense negotiation, Ukraine agreed to pay double for the gas exchange. It raised the fee that Russia had to pay in order to cross the country,

Speaker 2:          09:27          transport the gas to the rest of Europe bus. This was just the beginning. In the year 2009 we had the same problem but rather king sized. Russia wanted Ukraine to pay more for their gas. Once again, Kevin Moscow started insulting each other and in this case it was not only Ukraine, the one without gas for days, it was also the rest of Europe and that included the Czech Republic, Italy, Poland's and of course Germany. Yes, dear us, most of that Russian gas comes through Ukraine, so if Ukrainians have no gas to the Johnson's are other Europeans are going to be freezing too. Again, the story ends with Ukraine paying more for their gas in exchange for more transport fees. Nevertheless, just like game of thrones, Putin's tune is a song of ice and fire after freezing Europeans in 2006 and 2009 2014 when it was the year of fire and the fire came in a Ukrainian province, core Crimea

Speaker 2:          10:24          because as you know, Russians took it and so what did the European Union doing this case? Well, they just came to Peterson and essentially said, who's in your very naughty boy? We're going to sanction you. When do you all write these lines? 20 Times over? I will not invade other countries. I will not invade other countries. I will not invade other countries. Now Ukraine is more of a headache than anything else, but that's something we're going to cover in the next video of this series because yes, we all doing a series all about Russian gas. And if you don't want to miss it, well you know what to do this, this of dry and below in a ballad, do your thing. So now Europe has two options. Putin, Andy Schrader, they want to build new pipelines to bypass Ukraine. That is the first option. The second one is what the European Union once and that's defined other gas suppliers, but well, can they really do that now pay attention because we're going to answer that question. Attempts to diversify. The fastest way of diversifying is, you guessed it, buying liquefied natural gas. Now it is expensive, but countries do not need to wait to build new pipelines. So what's the problem there? Well, LNG ships are too busy with the Asian market,

Speaker 1:          11:43          basically.

Speaker 2:          11:43          Great. The Pacific Ocean is full of these ships that can go from Australia, Qatar, and to Malaysia to Japan, China. Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:50          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:55          You see in Asia, gas prices are higher than anywhere else. So Good Luck convincing America rock guitar to sell you. Then natural gas when they're getting rich off Asia. This is why the most realistic option is to build new pipelines. The question is though, wow,

Speaker 2:          12:18          so on the one hands, we have no way. This Europe already buys all of the gas they produce. Going south, we have Spain who wants to build the midcap pipeline that would connect to Algeria with northern Europe, but France is not very excited about the idea because that would mean they have to build the whole that in order to sell to other countries. Um, well, you know, Oh man, this is so much walk. Maybe tomorrow or maybe never. Maybe never. Never. Sounds good. All right. So then we have serious alternative so far as the so called Trans Adriatic pipeline or tap. This is meant to be finished by 2020. This pipeline goes from Azerbaijan crosses Turkey and goes all the way into Italy. But wait a minute, because this still is not enough. This pipeline has a maximum capacity of 20 billion cubic meters of gas. This isn't even a half the capacity of the Nord Stream two that connects Germany and Russia. But this is not the only problem when it comes to oil. Putin is a fairy jealous boyfriends. And if you thought he would put up with so much gas promiscuity when you're very wrong.

Speaker 1:          13:26          Gas

Speaker 2:          13:26          promises, gas transit via Ukraine to Europe may fall to 10 to 15 billion cubic meters per year. With this move, Putin kills two birds with one stone. Firsties forcing Europe to follow him and on top of that he bypasses Ukraine. But this is not the end of the story here in the south. Putin is also pushing to build brand new pipes. And yesterday if it was, if you thought Gerhard Schroeder is the only friend of Vladimir Putin in Europe, well you're all very, very good.

Speaker 1:          13:54          Rome hungry

Speaker 2:          13:59          once Russia's Turkish stream pipeline to be extended into Europe. But still there are two points we haven't dealt with her for one, we have to talk about Ukraine. Can Putin totally bypass them on top of that, we should definitely talk about as a budget on another dictatorship that will become Europe's best friend.
