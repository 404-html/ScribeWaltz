Speaker 1:          00:09          We may not talk much about Indonesia, but the truth is that this country matters much more than you probably think $250 million, half of them under the age of 30 make up Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country on the planet,

Speaker 1:          00:33          but Indonesia is also one of the most complicated countries in the wells. It's like, allow me to explain. Indonesia is a huge archipelago. The consists of more than 17,000 islands covering more than 5,000 kilometers. That's 3000 miles from end to end. This is approximately the distance from London to Afghanistan. Based on this alone, you can already imagine the enormous variety of ethnicities, cultures, and languages that have founded this country. Also the huge social differences. For instance, while these citizens of Jakarta are almost addicted to twitter, a fifth of the population doesn't even have access to electricity.

Speaker 1:          01:18          It didn't issues. Diversity is not just geographic and cultural. Different groups are essentially living at different points in human history all at the same time. Traveling from Jakarta to the Maluku islands can seem like going back in time. Elizabeth [inaudible], writer, journalist, and scientists, and you can imagine how difficult it can be to manage a country like this country, which by the way, Barack Obama spent a good part of his childhood in that right bomb. His mother married an Indonesian citizen in 1965 and two years later they moved to Jakarta. I feel great affection for the people here and obviously I have a sister who's half Indonesian. My mother lived and worked here for a long time and so the sights and the sounds and the memories and all fueled very familiar. Barack Obama. Alright, okay. Now some of you might be thinking, but Simon, I mean, why should I care about Indonesia? I mean, what's so special about this country? Well, Miss Eight, despite all of its difficulties, the Indonesian economy has grown a lot in recent decades, and the viewer, even though it may surprise us, Indonesia will soon become the largest Muslim power on the planet and that has lots and lots of social, political and economic implications.

Speaker 2:          02:28          You can even notice how people have changed their way of dressing. The average age is around 29 to 30 years. Those young people who have gone out into the market who are better trained, create an urban middle class with a huge dynamism, and this dynamism is what will change this country. Carlos gastone BBV, a representative in Indonesia.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Well, you can probably already imagined why we should care more about Indonesia than we do, but before taking a closer look at what's happening, he has a bit of history. Independence. Stevens in Asia has had two main protagonists and Suharto. You see Indonesia is actually a fairly new country. It wasn't until 1999 that it gained its independence from the Netherlands.

Speaker 3:          03:17          Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Yes. You had that right. Indonesia wasn't a British or French colony. It was a Dutch colony, and don't think that gaining their independence was easy. Not at all. Allow me to explain. Sukarno was an important leader of the resistance against colonial rule. In 1927, he founded the Indonesian Nationalist Party under this slogan, one nation, Indonesia, one people. The Indonesian one language Bahasa, Indonesia. Mike.

Speaker 3:          03:51          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Of course. As you can imagine, the Dutch authorities didn't like these ideas at all, so Sukarno was persecuted, detained, and finally forced into a kind of exile in Sumatra.

Speaker 3:          04:04          Hey,

Speaker 1:          04:04          imprisonment, dear viewer, which saw him released in weld water. You Buy Japanese troops. When they occupied Indonesia, the Japanese themselves joins the Indonesian nationalists to control the country

Speaker 3:          04:15          easily.

Speaker 1:          04:20          The fact is that two days off to Japan surrendered in August of 1945, it's economy declined. Indonesia's independence a declaration that wasn't recognized by the Dutch authorities indeed far from that, so they tried to regain power by force began the Socorro's national revolution that lasted for years. Um, which was very, very bloody after the birth of the Republican Indonesia, we experienced a painful separation process marked by terrible violence. These are dark pages of art history, burt calendars, Dutch, former minister of foreign affairs. To give you an idea, it is estimated that in just four years, more than 100,000 Indonesians and 5,000 soldiers lost their lives. And that is how finally in 1949, after much much suffering reduction authorities excepted underrecognized, Indonesia's independent. Yeah. Dictators,

Speaker 1:          05:20          Indonesia, achieving independent certainly didn't mean that the country was free over the following. Eighteen years. Economy led Indonesia in an increasingly authoritarian way under a model that became known as directed democracy, and I swear every time you put an adjective next to the term democracy usually beads that something is anything but democratic. During this time, all kinds of problems occurred, the country, it was really, really poor. The economy didn't work and there were all kinds of rebellions and conflicts as ethnic conflict, self-determination, a conflict with Malaysia and especially with the Indonesian Communist Party, first Communist Party and Asia by the way, which with China and the Soviet Union supports became increasingly important in the car.

Speaker 4:          06:02          True.

Speaker 1:          06:05          See, Staccato wasn't considered a communist leader, but he was a rather socialist. Nita who didn't mind getting close to Mao's China and even received support from the Soviet Union. This was something that didn't prevent the Indonesian communist party from wanting to seize power at all costs.

Speaker 4:          06:21          Right

Speaker 1:          06:24          between all of this pushing and shoving in 19, 65 and important happens, call me. C'Mon disconnected to the Communist Party. Prepared a who were interested in why.

Speaker 3:          06:33          Okay,

Speaker 1:          06:37          this events unleashed a brutal repression against the communist party that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and which the army general Suharto greatly took advantage of to seize power with support from the United States. During the following three decades. The hotter ruled the country with an iron fist. With Washington support, he launched some economic expansion measures that were quite successful and made their growth skyrockets. However, it was still a harsh dictatorship and the state's violence, political repression and corruption were tremendously widespread. So when at the end of the nineties, the Asian crisis occurred, the Indonesian economy will, it collapsed. The repeat lost 80 percent of its value against the dollar and poverty multiplied by four.

Speaker 1:          07:29          Faced with this disaster general Suharto, he was forced to leave after almost 50 years of independence and dictatorship democracy in Indonesia, I finally had a chance and finally, after a lot of conflicts because in this country conflicts that constants, the first free elections were held in 2004. Now, it must be said, of course, that since the hottest Indonesia has experienced a period of change, political openness, de-centralization as an economic policy that is more open to the wells, but even with all of this, it is still very highly restricted band in 2014, Indonesia's current President Joko Widodo popularly known as [inaudible] and usually qualified as the Indonesian Barack Obama won the elections. Can we promise to liberalize the country boost growth over seven percent per year and lay the foundations for Indonesia to become an economic and political power? Indeed the largest Muslim power in the world. That moments, my friends expectations west skyrocketing the international media spoke of Indonesia, has the country of the few chat bots. Wait just a minute because since then some things changed so

Speaker 3:          08:46          enough.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Go Widodo President. Between two worlds we know there's a rival was a great revolution. A great breath of fresh air, if you will, draw a week, was the first non military or political elites does in the country to take power. Social networks such as facebook, twitter, and youtube played an absolutely key role and the truth is that the new president started off his to make Indonesia become a much more competitive country on the right foot. See arrived in power among other measures. Joker, we greatly decrease. Stands, eliminated several subsidies and allocated that money about $40, billion dollars by the way, to try and solve one of the country's greatest problems. Then lack of infrastructure.

Speaker 3:          09:35          Sure,

Speaker 1:          09:39          something that makes transporting goods between the countries islands even more expensive than importing a container from Europe and not only that, the president has also launched several programs to decrease bureaucracy and regulations, which is another pretty big problem in Indonesia. Let me give you an example. I mean, check this out. Indonesia's regulations and bureaucracies are so strong that the. For example, if companies like Intertek, Zara or h and m wants to open a new store in Jakarta, they can't do it directly. They need a local franchise.

Speaker 3:          10:13          Yes,

Speaker 1:          10:17          it's more. Many sectors are simply closed to foreign investments and the government has to assume a large part of the weight it. Construction companies are a nautical industries, shipyards and many communication companies are still all state owned company.

Speaker 3:          10:31          Yes,

Speaker 1:          10:34          it is. The joker is also promoting opening special economic tourism and industrial areas and just launched a medical insurance model that has covered more than half of the population, so right now I imagine it's all sounding pretty darn good too. You Weld if you just hold on a moment, because despite everything, these changes are slower than the president promised and slower than they need to be. Therefore, even though foreign investment has grown, the growth rate is much lower than expected. Of course, this is not the biggest problem, nor what will probably cost this president, his reelection. Oh No. The big problem is that in recent years there have been outbreaks of religious fundamentalism, moderate Islamic power.

Speaker 3:          11:35          He is.

Speaker 1:          11:35          Indonesia has been presented as a kind of model like mostly Muslim country that recognize this religious freedom, a country that is becoming increasingly open to the world as where women participate actively in political life. Indonesia tradition of moderate Islam frankly, is an inspiration to the world and we you and your people in your nation. As in mind, religion unifies it, does not divide Mike Pence, US, vice president. In fact, this is how the Indonesian government presents itself to the rest of the world. Indonesia is the world's third largest democracy, and we also have the world's largest Muslim population is demonstrates that democracy and Islam are not incompatible. Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia. However, in recent years there has been a significant increase in religious radicalism. This is something that organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are denouncing, and the truth is that they have every reason to do so. For example, last year, the Indonesian Leymah Council, the largest religious authority in the country, decided to defend the belief that Christians and other nonbelievers shouldn't be able to hold political positions in areas that were majority Muslim, which does pertain to the vast majority of the country. Only other hands. The governor of Jakarta and close ally of President Jokowi, a Christian of Chinese ancestry, known as a hawk has been condemned for blast from eight by insinuating that politics and religion should be separate.

Speaker 3:          13:02          Great.

Speaker 1:          13:04          Recent years, the Islamist parties discourse has become a lot harsher. For example, in 2018, they are proposing a change to the penal code to prosecute relations outside of marriage and between same sex couples more harshly and even make cohabitation of single couples illegal. See Right now, Indonesia is still a relatively moderate country and most of its population supports and open democracy and even religious freedom, but everything points to the probability that in the 2019 election, the Islamists will have a larger chance of winning and it's clear that we'll talking about a future power that can give us many joys for many headaches. See if the current reforms continue. Indonesia will be a huge market. For example, it's estimated that by 2030, the Indonesian middle class will consume much more than Germany's middle class,

Speaker 1:          14:00          and if religious moderation winds its influence in the Muslim world will be much, much stronger. So we can only hope that Indonesia goes down the right path, but now it's your turn. Do you think we should support Indonesia's favoring? Have a more moderate status?
