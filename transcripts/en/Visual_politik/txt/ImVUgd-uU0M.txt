Speaker 1:          00:00          That is video is going to be a bit special. It's a little bit difference. We're not going to be talking about politics today. Instead, we actually wanted to tell you a bit more about visual policy itself. In other words, we're going to talk about this channel because, well, we've got some important news to tell you.

Speaker 1:          00:26          A few weeks ago we marked the one year anniversary of this channel and today we're well on our way to half a million subscribers as every day 100,000 people view a video. Now, whenever you start a new business or a youtube channel, there's always some risk attached to that, and honestly, we all at visual politic felt that starting a political channel on youtube, it was kind of a particularly big risk in forms rather than sensational politics on any medium, especially youtube is not exactly eight super hot topic. It's not an exciting blog. It's not a gaming channel. It's not even top 10 lists, and quite honestly, while we hoped it would do well, we didn't really expect that the channel would grow in quite the way that it has now. As many of you might know, this is not my first channel. In fact, I have three other youtube projects on the go right now, so well now you might be wondering, well what made me choose to start this one in particular, what made me think the visual politic was a good idea and worth all of the risk? Well, in this video I want to tell you that story.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Wherever you're watching this video from, I am willing to bet there is plenty of media coverage about politics. I'm sure there are news outlets and political talk shows of all stripes satisfying both sides of the political spectrum and I really don't want to focus on criticism here because many of these news outlets do trudy outstanding journalism, but in general there are a couple of issues. The first one is emotion. The media playbook on politics as that people who watch news do save to confirm their views. If you're conservative, you'll watch conservative news and the exact same thing goes if you are liberal media, Gary's will tell you that the way you make politics appealing is by showing emotion and also showing confrontation. This is exactly why it's so many shows tend to exaggerate their political positions. It creates a bigger conflicts. Now the chances are you already knew that, but like I said, there were a couple of issues here and the second one is one that you might not be so familiar with.

Speaker 1:          02:32          You see, by definition, journalists are focused on exceptional facts. Consider this aphorism from journalism. A dog biting a kid is not newsworthy, but a kid biting a dog is. This has actually been the cornerstone of political news since what kind of since forever. Let me give you a more real world example here. Anytime an oil tanker sinks, this will hit the news on and on. Go the extensive reports, the interviews with experts and all kinds of extended analysis, but nobody's talking about the thousands of oil tankers that don't sync all of the thousands that simply make it to their destination on a schedule and without problems and display what you might think from all that media coverage, those ships, the ones that go on those regular journeys, they are the ones that have a far bigger impact on your life. Because I'm willing to bet that the price of fuel for your car affects you far more than that last oil tankers sinking off the coast of somewhere.

Speaker 1:          03:27          But the reality is that we build our perception of reality based on those rare happenings, not the normal everyday realities of life. And this leads us to not really understand the reality of life at all. And now let me give you another example. This one with a bit more of a visual politic flavor Africa, unless you are a regular visual politic view at your mind, still think of Africa as an entire continent full of poverty and misery. And why is this? Well, that's because when a journalist talks about Africa, he talks about the exceptional things, a war in Congo, corruption in Angola, starvation in Somalia and on and on and on. But economic progress, it's not some exceptional event. It's just something that ticks along little by little, day by day, never really a big enough story to make the headlines. And headlines are what people read there.

Speaker 1:          04:14          What people have been conditions to care abouts. And it's not just Africa. And that's just a random example. It's the whole world. I mean, Austin man on the street, what the status of the world is today, and he's probably not going to be full of optimism. Well, it is war. Well, it's poverty, it's corruption. But do you know what the dog biting the kid of this story is? The oil tanker that arrives safely to its destination? Well, as the simple facts, but we live in the best time in history, and this is not an optimistic dreamlike viewpoint. It's absolute reality based on facts. We've got the growing middle class in Asia, rick clear path to the elimination of starvation in Africa and life expectancy is higher than ever before, pretty much everywhere. Oh, hope is that if you're watching this video, you want a realistic view on the world's not one salons.

Speaker 1:          04:58          It by popular media desperately needing to show you conflicts and demotion, and this isn't just about giving you an informed opinion for the sake of it. It's about giving you an informed opinion because many negative elements of society take advantage of people who believe that the world is in trouble. Very little is better than that. Polarizing as society. It's stirring up populist movements and on the micro level even causing us to make bad decisions in our day to day lives. All right, so so far a lot of big talk, but what does visual politic actually have to offer you here? Well, we're here for context. We're not competing with traditional media. We're not trying to get in that 24 hour news cycle, and so get me wrong. It's absolutely great to be reading newspapers and watching TV news. They're going to tell you the daily news, so we're going to give you the trends and the movements that are changing our entire worlds.

Speaker 1:          05:45          This is why visual policy, we'd love to compare one country to another or dive into the history of a situation in depth before we tell you what's happening in the present day. Context is so important and it's so often missed by TV news because they need to get the story that is breaking that very moment. It's the story that's breaking that hour. Even the story, it was breaking that minutes, but most important of all is that we do this while keeping our independence. Not every media outlet or even youtube channel can say this, but visual politic is 100% independent. There's no think tank behind the scenes writing checks. This new company providing us with a fancy office and there's no political party peddling influence. There's no hidden agenda here. We publish our content in English and Spanish and we are funded 100% by our own resources. Because I know you might be wondering why throughout this video I've talked about we rather than just I or me.

Speaker 1:          06:32          And that's because as you can probably imagine, there's a team behind me, there's a team helping me create the best content possible here with four people, if you include myself. And if you want to see the other guys behind the team, check the Spanish language channel, they present all of the videos over there. And this is not some easy job behind the scenes of every video here. This is between 15 hours and 25 hours of research. All of our sources, double checks, and we make sure that all of our stories meet the highest standards. Oh. And then comes to the actual writing and the editing and the recording and the production and the channel managements and as well on and on and on. All right, so at a very visual politic way, let me address a few critics very quickly because there's probably people wandering in their minds now, dia really have no viewpoints.

Speaker 1:          07:13          Do you have no bias at all? I mean, are you complete fuel and talking about each and every issue? And the honest answer there is no. In fact, anybody can be completely neutral when talking about politics, not even in theory. From the very moment once opic is chosen over another appoints already being made, it's just totally inescapable. So with that in mind is what is our view and what is our bias? What I think it's probably best described in a more positive light as a principal and that principal would simply be freedom. We believe freedom should be an absolute core value of politics, more specifically respect for the freedom and the civil rights of people to the greatest degree possible. Another principle we stand for is cultural understanding. We've consistently stated that free trade between countries and cooperation among peoples is the best mechanism for peace and prosperity on a global scale.

Speaker 1:          08:01          As we've demonstrated in many, many videos, the evidence shows that isolationism and protectionism do not lead to anything good. But finally, almost important principle is not to be dogmatic. Everything we say is fact based and we can have our minds changed if someone gives us a good reason to change them. This is why your feedback and your comments are so important to our projects. You the viewer, provide us with new information and new sources and many of our videos are made simply because one of you contacted us with information about the country and said we should make a video about it. So all of that was a really long way for me to introduce you to something that you're probably already know quite a bit about. But now let me tell you something you don't know. Let me tell you where we want to be in the future.

Speaker 1:          08:53          We wants to go further. We want to make more content. We want to make more videos in different formats. We want to go to different places around the world and show them to you. We want to introduce you to the people behind the stories. The people who really are changing the world that we live in. Oh, and on top of that, we also want to have our own website with more official policy concepts. In summary, we want to take visual politic to the next level and take this community that we've built along with us and we need your help. Many of you have asked us already why we don't have a Patrion page and the truth is, but it's something that we've been considering for a really long time. The truth is that we realized that if we want to do more, we need more and we need a way to do it while maintaining independence and now everyone else who wants to help us can, if you want to, you can join us in taking visual politic to the next level and just quickly, for those of you who don't know about it, patron is a platform that connects creators with those who want to contribute financially to that creator below.

Speaker 1:          09:46          We're not taking anything away here that's really important to say. The classic visual politic videos that we post every week on youtube will always be available to everyone for free. But now for less than what you pay for a beer, you can make all our ideas, more videos, more specials, so websites and even essentially books or reality. Further, if you do contribute, you're going to get access to exclusive contents as well as plenty of other surprises. If you click the link in the description box below, you can check it off Patrion page and learn more about the goals that we've set. And of course on that page you can choose the type of commitment that you might want to have. And finally, I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you for your support. Thanks to you, visual politic is possible. So to everyone who's watched and shared our video centers, music centers, ideas, left us comments while big thank you from me and the rest of us now I'm sure over the next year we're going to continue to grow into an even greater community with more possibilities and without you on if that's possible. So once again, thank you very much and I'll see you in the next video.
