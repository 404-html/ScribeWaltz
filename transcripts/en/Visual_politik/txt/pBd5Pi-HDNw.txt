Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          almost 50 years ago in 1969 then president Richard Nixon announced the so called war on drugs. It's a hard line strategy that aims to pursue and punish the production, distribution and consumption of substances that were considered prohibited drugs. America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. Since then is if you, even though Washington has used all his mind to this hotline strategy as a result of is in a resounding failure both at home and abroad. See, each year the u s government spends tens of billions of dollars in this particular war, achieving practically nothing more than imprisoning hundreds of thousands of people and fueling a culture of violence. The war on drugs has been going on for 60 years, and if a business, if I'd had a business that had failed for 60 years, I would have closed it down 59 years ago. The federal government's figures on arrests for violence. NC drug laws are absolutely

Speaker 1:          01:01          schilling

Speaker 2:          01:06          for the shoulder. Every year the United States authorities rest more than 1 million people for breaking anti drug laws. That is to say in 10 years, the United States, the rest as many people as the entire population of Greece or Cuba for drug related crimes, which is well, a lot of

Speaker 1:          01:27          people since

Speaker 2:          01:30          1989 ans listen carefully because this is rather impressive in the United States, more people have been imprisoned for this type of crime than for all other violent crimes combined. Our most serious problem today is cocaine and in particular crap. Who's responsible? Let me pet you straight out. Everyone who uses drugs, everyone who sells drugs and everyone who looks the other way. In fact, this is precisely what has led the country to have the highest incarceration rate in the wells four or five times higher than other countries like France or Germany and even higher than totalitarian countries like China. It's all pretty damn crazy as of course, as you can imagine, US jails aren't exactly the best place in the world to rehabilitate. In fact, the American experience seems to say quite the opposite, but all right, you might be thinking, okay, Simon, it might be a tough strategy, but maybe it's fulfilling its purpose, right? Well, the truth is that no, it isn't beyond crowding prison spending hundreds of billions and condemning many young people do have difficulties of reentering the world with a criminal record. This war on drugs as achieved very, very little. In fact, it's achieved practically nothing. In fact, despite so many efforts, the United States still has one of the highest drug use rates in the world. This rate is even higher today than it was in the 1980s we lost more than 175

Speaker 3:          03:00          to overdoses every day, and millions more are struggling with addiction

Speaker 2:          03:04          and regarding their results outside of the United States. What? What can I say? We only need to take a look at Latin America to see how that's gone because my friends, there was one thing this war on drugs has certainly achieved, and that's helping drug traffickers make a lot of money. Yup. You heard that right?

Speaker 4:          03:21          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:27          Entire pro edition and strong anti strategy. I've made the illegal drug trade extremely lucrative. Basically a goldmine, which is pouring money into drug traffickers, gangs and cartels, while spreading violence throughout Latin America.

Speaker 5:          03:41          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:42          Cocaine cartel does not begin in Meti and Columbia. It begins in the streets of New York, Miami, Los Angeles and every American city were crack is bought and sold. Nancy Reagan

Speaker 5:          03:52          and drug dealers need to know that we want them out of high schools, neighborhoods and our lives and the only way to do that is to take the customers away from the product, say no to drugs and say yes to life.

Speaker 2:          04:07          That holds your horse is just a moment because often many failures it seems a new strategy isn't being pursued in the United States and so far, well the results have been quite promising. You might have heard about the changes in the marijuana industry

Speaker 1:          04:20          with these scissors. I dubbed the Bri

Speaker 3:          04:34          big change

Speaker 2:          04:38          on January the first 2018 California became the eighth territory in the United States to legalize the production, distribution and consumption of marijuana for recreational use. It's a medical use was approved way back in 1996

Speaker 1:          04:53          wow,

Speaker 2:          04:54          thanks. Is this in addition to California and Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Massachusetts, Maine, Washington, Nevada, ans the capital of Washington DC. Marijuana is recreational use is perfectly legal for its paws. The state of Vermont has just announced that starting on July the first possession and consumption will also be legal.

Speaker 1:          05:14          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:15          As we're talking about a very, very important change, especially if you take into account so that federal legislation as we'll see later, still considers this a prohibited activity. Well, last year this new marijuana industry legally moved almost a $7 billion, a figure that is expected to rise strongly in the upcoming years, especially since the California market alone is estimated to make more than $5 billion. We're talking about an industry that is already generating many jobs and also paying loads of tax and we're not only talking about selling marijuana for direct consumption. A lot of new businesses are also emerging, which take advantage of its ingredients,

Speaker 3:          05:54          candy, cookies, sweets. We have hundreds of products.

Speaker 2:          05:58          This business is worth a lot and the state keeps 25% of every dollar we make. Eric Kinney, owner of Zen, West Hollywood, a marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles. Understand to believe the states that have legalized this industry have also set special regulations and taxes for it.

Speaker 1:          06:15          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:16          Cities and counties have basically done the same thing, regulation state, how it can be sold, where it can be sold, and how much has to be paid for it. It's like any other heavily regulated industry. Look at the pharmaceutical industry or the liquor industry. They're heavily, heavily regulated industries and the cannabis industry is no different. Cara Martinson, Federal Affairs Manager for the California State Association of counties, and this is not exactly cheap for these companies. In some California in cities, the sum of all taxes can amounts to 40% of these new companies turnover, which is a lot in Colorado. The first dates there's a legalized the sale and consumption of marijuana for recreational use, the industry already invoices about $1 billion every year and to the state's income in taxes exceed $200 million. Among the eight states where recreational marijuana is legal only Washington as a higher tax rate at about 50% Colorado and Nevada both follow with rates of 36% Oregon has a tax of 20% and Alaska has a rate of up to 20% Aaron Smith, a CNN reporter, however you had to wait a minutes because everything doesn't end here. Let's just say that there's a problem. I'm very serious problem, in fact,

Speaker 2:          07:26          as I said before, federal us, nor continues to consider this a forbidden activity which makes this type of business very difficult, if not impossible when it comes to, for example, obtaining credits from the financial institution. Of course, if a bank decides to finance these companies activities, they could even be accused of collaborating with a drug trafficker and not only that, see until now a policy in stools by the Obama Administration was in force, which led to the Justice Department asking federal prosecutors not to file charges if the drug's production sale and consumption with legal based on state laws. Well, this policy known as the Cole memo was suspended by Jeff sessions. Donald trump's appointed attorney general.

Speaker 6:          08:06          This drug is dangerous. You cannot play with it. It's not funny. It's not something to laugh about and and trying to send that message with clarity that good people don't smoke marijuana.

Speaker 2:          08:18          The prosecutor has announced that he wants to prosecute marijuana businesses, which by the way, trump promised he wouldn't do during his campaign. But I think in terms of marijuana, I think, and legalization, I think that should be a state issue state. This is why this entirely new industry is now submerged in a sea of uncertainty. Will be attorney general, fulfill his wishes. Will the trump administration attack the marijuana industry? These are the questions on the table, but well, only the future can answer for now though. We can discuss why this change in approach could be a huge, I'm of changes a few years since Colorado became the first states in 2014 to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Just as we've seen in this video, a few more states have joined since then, so we can now analyze what's happens and we can look at this policy's consequences. The time legalization critic stated that the risks of allowing the recreational use of cannabis were really high. For example, they said consumption among miners would probably increase as would crime and traffic accidents. Well, now we can see what actually happens and it's not just the truth is nothing like these catastrophic predictions. Neither violence nor consumption among miners and our traffic accidents have increased. In fact, legalization has had very positive consequences

Speaker 2:          09:45          on the one hand and the quality of the product sold on the black market has increased in consumption of more dangerous substances has actually decreased in the states. Legalization of marijuana for recreational use has given us consumers access to high quality marijuana. We genetically improve strains, groaning, greenhouses or rule beneath does manawat a drug war expert at Mexico's National Autonomous University and keep listening here because this is really important. A few years ago, the Cato Institute published a study that determines that eight out of 10 deaths caused by drugs. What do you to the product? Poor quality. This is a major social problem, so consumption except for medicine we'll use is never good. That certainly clear, but there's still the demands, which is why improving the product quality and safety reduces or potential damage, but there's more hair

Speaker 2:          10:37          legalization is reducing as logical the cartels business and therefore the money that these groups receive. In addition, and this is perhaps its most important effects, it has allowed a marijuana trafficking related arrests do drop, which has had two very clear consequences for one security forces and courts have been able to allocate more resources to fighting serious crime and for another it has reduced the number of people in prison for victimless crimes like marijuana consumption. We could say that in the states that opted for legalization, the culture of violence, which is a serious problem in the United States has decreased. And if that one's enough, legalization means that the governments can now collect taxes from this industry. So if the United States wants to decrease its high consumption rates, it looks like a legalizing marijuana, maybe a really good idea. Legalization sheds light on a business that has been in the shadows until now, while allowing for a safer and better controlled products. On top of that, the authorities get allocate the money obtained through this industry's taxes to carry out awareness and health campaigns. It's something that my the way was very successful in Portugal, but that's something we're going to talk about in another video.

Speaker 2:          11:48          The fact is maybe due to all of this polls showed that more than 60% of Americans favor legalization. More states are continuing to announce their intention to legalize marijuana, not only for medical use but also for recreational. This is certainly something that's becoming a trend.

Speaker 2:          12:10          In 2013 year ago, I became the first country in the world to legalize the production, distribution and consumption of marijuana. Although it is highly regulated that in the year 2018 everything indicates the Canada is going to follow in his footsteps. At least that's what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised. The reason we are choosing to legalize control marijuana is because the current system is not protecting our kids. It's right now easier for a an underage Canadian, the teenager to buy a joint, uh, than it is for them to get their hands on a bottle of beer. By the way, just as an extra hit about 80 cannabis related companies are listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange and in 2017 they revalued by no less than 250% not bad. Right. It seems like a new industry is developing a new industry in which among others the well known investor, Peter Thiel, who we already talked about here on visual politic is betting strongly namely through the Canadian company privateer holdings, which is setting up the largest marijuana plantation in Europe, in Portugal.

Speaker 2:          13:10          Anyways, you have your, that's the way things are, but now it's your turn. Do you support the legalization of marijuana?
