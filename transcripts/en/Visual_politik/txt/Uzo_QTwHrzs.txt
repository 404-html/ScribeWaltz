Speaker 1:          00:07          With over $95 million inhabitants, Egypt is the biggest country in the Arab wells and yes I know what you're thinking on Indonesia and Pakistan, bigger than Egypt, they Muslim to well, yes, they all live yet, but make no mistake, there is a difference between Arab and Muslim. Islam is simply a religion. While Arabic is a culture or race and especially a language inside this Arab world, Egypt isn't only the most populous country. It's one of the most influential. This is why the Arab League has its headquarters on the Taquerias Square in the very center of Cairo. And why news like this? It's like worrying. Egypt rises to 300, five people in their deadliest terrorist attack. Nonetheless, despite the latest news, Egypt is changing faster than we might think, maybe urine under the Arab spring in 2011 thousands of people protested for days to overthrow a Haas Niamh Uber Act. The dictator who ruled the country back then a year later, the Muslim Brotherhood gains power ready to defend the country into the pyramids of an Islamic republic, but now in 2017, the Egyptian politics off taking a 180 degree shift. Gypsy government closes 27,000 mosques to fight terrorism. So now the question becomes, well, how did we get here and Egypt of coming a secular country. While today we're going to answer those questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history

Speaker 2:          01:37          Muslim Brotherhood

Speaker 1:          01:39          that all three names here defined Egypt's history in the last 60 years. NASA, Sadat and Mubarak, these three politicians have a common ingredients. They will all dictators that fully the principles of Arab socialism. This was the trend, the ideology back then, our cocktail that combined a centralized economy, authoritarian leadership and secularism must make a mistake because socialist as they claim to be, none of these needles had any problem with changing their rubles into dollars. As soon as the Soviet Union disappeared. In fact, Sadat recognize the state of Israel ends during the 19 eighties. Egypt was already an ally of America,

Speaker 1:          02:20          and as you know, befriending America in this part of the world puts you on the radical Islam, the bullseye. This is why Uber Mubarak prosecuted every Islamic movement. Part of this repression was to avoid the terrorist attacks that became pretty frequent in the 19 nineties, but uber and also had other motivations. He wanted to stop any potential challenge to his authoritarian rule and guests. You the only organized group here at replacing was well and yes, that would be the Muslim Brotherhood. Despite being a client destined movement since 1954, the Muslim Brotherhood is the most organized grassroots organization sense Egypt's independence

Speaker 2:          02:53          today,

Speaker 1:          02:57          thousands of members and millions of the goal is to turn Egypt into an Islamic republic compliant with Sharia Law and the principles of the Koran. Nonetheless, the Muslim Brotherhood isn't the only radical group in this country. Here we can also find the Salafist superseded the same goals, but by different means. The guys you see on the screen now then was an brothers, as you can see, they dress in a very western fashion, cities, et cetera. Now these other guys, all the Salafist members, do you see the difference? Salafi have traditional Muslim clothes, beard sounds the every bar on their foreheads is created after hitting the ground so many times while praying to Mecca.

Speaker 3:          03:37          Okay?

Speaker 1:          03:39          As you can probably figure it out from the name, the Salafi is wanting to live long. The first Muslims, the Socorro, Salafi did. However, the Muslim brothers are way more pragmatic in better organized than members, infiltrate government institutions, and they have no problem disclosing their intentions when they speak to the western media.

Speaker 1:          03:59          We are not terrorists. The Muslim Brotherhood's philosophies inspired by an understanding of Islam that emphasizes the values of social justice, equality, and the rule of law God dot spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood. In other words, both the salaries and the Muslim Brotherhood have the same goals, but different strategies. Today, the salar fists have a political party you called our nor, and this has nothing to do with the Muslim brothers. As you can imagine. The radicals don't like each other very much. Remember this, because we will come back to it later anyway. During the 19 eighties, the military dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak attacked both of these groups. In fact, since the year 1981, Egypt has been in a neverending state of emergency where every political dissident is sent to jail.

Speaker 1:          04:49          This means thousands of fists and Muslim brothers spending decades behind bars, and as you can imagine, neither the European Union nor the United States did anything to stop this. At the end of the day, nobody wanted to see the Islamic radicals in the government. If this was not enough, after the young Kapoor, warm Egypt had become a good ally of Israel and their economy, it was on fire. Think about it. This country has all the ingredients for a world class tourism industry, the Pyramids denial, the desert, the Red Sea. You can say that by the year 2000, you couldn't label yourself a traveler if you didn't have an Egyptian stamp on your passport. So for 30 years and had a free pass to rule Egypt that, wait just a second, because in 2011 things really changed our signals, Egypt succession by taking someone to Washington news only exist when made both the citizens and some factions of the army. Equally enraged. Having a dictator is one thing. Having a hereditary density of power is quite another. This is how the Arab spring canes, Egypt's and why Mubarak out to resign, a year later, parliamentary ends. Presidential elections were held. We're talking about a country that has decades under a dictatorship where the only strong political movements other than the government itself by the Salafis and the Muslim Brotherhood. So I guess he won those elections. Yes, it was the Muslim Brotherhood led by the guy you see on the screen. Now, Mohammed,

Speaker 1:          06:18          wait a minute because things are way more complex unless you are Saudi Arabia and you are sitting on a pile of soil. Radical Islam isn't good for managing an economy. So in less than one year Egypt's economy, it absolutely sank. Thousands of people lost their jobs and inflation skyrockets. Meanwhile, mostly his main goal was to Islam as the government stop the division of power and shield his own power. Then you've got to add into this equation, the army, as we said before, Egyptian defense forces on new big fan of Islamist groups, and this is how when you play, I came into the picture, Marshall, Abigail, fertile cc was the head of the Egyptian armed forces. He met the leaders of the opposing parties including the Salafist and basically said something like, okay, so Doug Morris, he and his friends, they're really screwing up. The government's help me set to the candidates are and we can put things back in order and as we say here, a visual politic. As it was said Sir, it was done land of the pharaohs. By the year 2013, the Egyptian army kicked mostly out of the governments. That's as policy was to make the Muslim Brotherhood and illegal organization again. Of course, protesters went to the streets and it's hundreds of them died and thousands of them were sent to jail. But in June of 2014 new elections were held, and I say elections there because there was virtually a single candidate I'll cc and he managed to get 97 percent of the vote.

Speaker 1:          07:46          The other except candidate was a guy with a zero percent chance of winning, called Habonim some bar heap. He got the other three percent of the vote. So maybe you've seen the movie, the Dark Knight. There's this amazing quote, it says you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Well, this could have been coined by LCC himself. In fact, in the last few years, Egypt has become the world's number one leader in people given the death penalty. But not only that, in just three years, the government has closed over 27,000 mosques further. There is no freedom of speech whatsoever. And yes, I know what you're thinking here. The Islamic fanatics are pretty angry about this. Well, actually the opposite is true. Do you remember how I said that? The Salafist and the Muslim Brothers aren't good friends? Well, I was definitely not kidding about that. You should ultra conservative Islam a back isis, seek to eclipse brotherhood bots. Wait just a minute because things are not good for the Salafist. See them. Of course lcc gave them enough so they could fill the roles left by the Muslim brothers, but those Egyptian believers, he wanted to go to a mosque, have to go to those controlled by the oil as hot emanates, which is under government to control, but you know what the biggest problem is here that are less and less believers in Egypt. The percentage of youngsters who pray daily has halved in less than $5.

Speaker 2:          09:14          Yes,

Speaker 1:          09:19          a barometer in the year, 2011, 84 percent of the population supported Sharia law influencing politics in 2016, that percentage fell to 34 percent, but not only that, I'll cc himself, celebrates the Christian Christmas in the Coptic Cathedral of Kairos year after year. In other words, Egyptian society, that's becoming more and more secular, but before you get too excited, wait just a moment because this could change at any moments. First of all, lccs popularity fell in 2017. A good share of Egyptians do not like the fact that he gave Saudi Arabia sovereignty over two islands in the red seat. They also don't like the repression either. In fact, newsline, this kind of resembles x time clair state of emergency after deadly church attacks on the other hands that your comedy is most Egyptians named worry. Despite the unemployment rate's still going down, it's still over 12 percent and these are the official figures. Some experts say that it might be over 20 and displayed all of this. The government is working on pharaoh like projects Egypt to build new capital paid for by China after this, the terrorist attacks, and we can only conclude the [inaudible]. Governments is failing more than it is succeeding.

Speaker 1:          10:34          So now the question is, do you believe Egypt's can turn into a secular country the way neighboring tune is, he admits, or do you think lccs governments is Deja Vu of uber x and that eventually we will see a brand new Arab spring in this country?
