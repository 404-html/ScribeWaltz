Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          It's a challenge for you. I'll show you. Finish watching this video goes your kitchen and open the fridge. Then try to find something that has been produced outside of your country. If you're watching this video from a European country, tried to find some product produced outside of the European Union, I bet she probably can't even find it. Maybe this doesn't surprise you. Well, if you think about it a little more considered that your mobile phone has been manufactured in more than 20 different countries. The trousers you're wearing right now, we're probably manufactured in a country like China or Bangladesh, and maybe the company you work for is also foreign. I mean, there's no surprises there, right? I mean, we will live in a globalized economy. Nonetheless. Food is the exception to the rule.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Really,

Speaker 2:          00:57          agriculture is an industry that is completely protected from foreign competition and make no mistake here. This has nothing to do with Donald Trump. In fact, if you think he's the creator of trade was, well, your actually absolutely wrong. Actually, the primary sector exists in a never ending cold war. That's why from time to time we see headlines like this one

Speaker 2:          01:23          war rips through farm world, soybean hog prices fall, or maybe this one cuts import tariffs in a bid to end. Banana wars are morven tariffs out. In fact, tariffs aren't just one of the many tools you use to attack foreign markets bands. They're not even the deadliest. Here's an example. American spends more than $20 billion a year in subsidies that are farmers sounded like a lot to you. Well, not compared to the whopping $72 billion that the EU spends in subsidies every single year. And how you might be wondering, well, what do the subsidies have to do with trade was, and the answer that as well. A lot example, this milk rake you see on the screen here is worth an average of 60 euro cents and a Spanish supermarket from those 60 cents. The Spanish Pharma would get 30 cents, but it's actual revenue is going to be 44 cents. And why is this? Well, that's because the European Union will give them a subsidy of 14 cents per liter, thanks to this grand. So the farmer can sell cheap and still make money. And this is why Europe doesn't need to buy African sugar despite it being cheaper or even more surprisingly, why American or European producers can snatch the competition from African markets despite there having higher wages. But hold on a minute here because things are about to change. And this time the free market champion is not America. It's not Japan or even Australia dare viewer, despite what you might expect if there is somebody willing to start an agricultural. It's actually the European. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:01          union.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Well macron breaks French taboo on farm subsidies. A French president questioning these subsidies on farming is like a hipster closing his instagram accounts. It's something that's never been done before for years. The so called Common Agricultural Policy, also known as the CAAP has been one of the pillars of the European Union and France is by far its biggest supporter. But like I said, things that are about to change. So now the question becomes is you're really ready to liberalize its agricultural sex up. Oh, we about to see the ends of the food trade wars. And most importantly of all here is this good or bad news swell. In this video we are going the answer all of these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back.

Speaker 1:          03:52          The history

Speaker 2:          03:57          he used for, let's imagine that we have a wheat farm in Essex in the UK. We harvest the crop and go to sell it to the month.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Yes,

Speaker 2:          04:10          boss time we did, we received 175 pounds per ton. So it makes sense to expect to sell it for a similar price this time around, right? Well actually no, I mean maybe this time the market price for wheat is actually just 150 pounds per ton. This is a reality that every farmer faces every year. By contrast, the price of an iphone, it doesn't really change much over time. So if we sell I phones, we can make good predictions about our income, but wheat, corn oil, or any other commodity can change their market price from one day to the next. And I, you might be wondering, well, why? Why does this happen? What is the difference between wheat and it's an iphone? While the differences that commodities at the same everywhere. Maybe you eat some bread today. Could you tell me where the weeks it was made from? What's produced? Well, probably not. The same goes with the oil used to produce the gasoline that you put in your car. You don't know if it's Saudi or Canadian and you don't really care. You just want it to be as absolutely cheap as possible. Nonetheless, there I'll just a few dinosaur juice producers. Meanwhile, there are many producers of wheat, corn, and potatoes, so if one big producer had a good harvest, that's going to affect that market price for everybody. And then of course you've got to add to this, the weather, too little rain, too much rain or an unusually cold. Windsor can be enough to kill off all of your revenue. Nonetheless, we need agriculture because unfortunately you cannot eat oil or only phones.

Speaker 2:          05:50          So how can we keep eating while farmers don't staff? Now this might sound like a stupid question, but belief knee, it's one of the hardest problems in economics as well. This is where that common agricultural policy that we mentioned comes into play. This is how the European Union protects the farmers. When we talk about the CAAP, we're talking about the cornerstone of the European Union. It was the thing even before the Schengen area or the eurozone were even born. Ashley, do you know who the father of the CIP was? Well, yeah. It was that French president, Charles de [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:27          gold

Speaker 2:          06:32          nation has no friends, only interests. Charles did God. Now, if you've been subscribed to visual politic for a while, you already know that Charles, the goal was not exactly a big fan of the free markets. Well, actually he wasn't really a big fan of anyone except himself. Really. This is why we're in France, became a member of the European single market. What would later become the European Union. He added a condition. He basically said, all right, we're going to sign up, but you got to promise us that nobody's going to become our competition for farmers. All right, and basically that salvage the Apu was born a policy that is so intervention list. It makes Bernie Sanders look blank. Warren Buffett

Speaker 1:          07:15          basically

Speaker 2:          07:15          in order to compensate for potential losses when market prices go down, the European Union gives them direct cash. For example, if you have a bond with cows in Spain, Brussels will still give you cash straight away for each and every calvet you own. And if you want to buy a milking machine that is going to make you more presumptive, well Brussels is going to help you with that. Sue, this way, Europe is not only guaranteeing your income, but it's also helping it to protect you from American or African producers. And as you might have already imagined, all of this aid costs say it's a load of money. So if you want to get a better idea during the 1990s the caap comprised 80% of the whole European budgets and even now when Europe is bigger and it's got more stuff to do, the CAAP, it still makes up 40% of all you spending and surprise surprise there I guess which comes from, he receives most of the aids. Of course it's France, but hold on just a moment because things they do not stop right here beyond his direct aid. Europe also has other tactics to avoid price fluctuations as well as quotas and tariffs.

Speaker 2:          08:29          For example, in order to avoid a price drop in milk, Europe used to put a production limits on each country. That means that you couldn't produce more than a certain number of liters and it's of course he was benefiting the most from these production quotas. Well, of course it was the country of croissant and the guests. As you can imagine, this milk quota, it created all kinds of problems among the other members. And this is why despite French pressure, Europe had to put an end to all of this

Speaker 2:          09:01          end of European milk quotas, a new era for the French dairy sector. And of course we also have the tariffs tariffs. They're like sniper bullets designed to stop very specific products from getting into European markets. For example, imagine that you are an Argentinian coffee producer. If you want to sell your law coffee, meaning you take it from the plant and the sellers Europe, they got no problem. Zero tariffs for you. And why is that? Well, it's because no European country grows coffee, but if you want to sell this coffee and it's already toasted and processed form, well good luck to you. You're going to have to pay a tariff of 7.5% and why is that? Well, because Europe has factories that process and toast coffee and they just don't really like competition boss. I knew what you're thinking right now. Oh, that evil European Union, that punishment, the third wells, those Brussels bureaucrats, they just want to destroy free trade. Well, I've actually got bad news for you because the reality is that every country on the planet does the exact same thing. In fact, when it comes to tariffs, Europe is actually one of the most open regions.

Speaker 2:          10:18          For example, if the same farmer wants to sell his coffee in Japan, he's going to have to pay a 20% tariff if he wants to sell bananas. Then he asked to pay between 40 and 50% depending on the season as what about America is a land of the free? Well, it's actually kind of the same. There. Almost no country is willing to leave its farmers alone in order to compete with fat competition. Nonetheless, all of this can change and why? Well, let's have a look at that. At times for protectionism, every year Europe spends over $72 billion subsidizing its own farmers. There's, as you can imagine, not all the country. Then there's paid the same amount. Just have a look at this chart here. You can see the main contributors. That is the countries that pay more than what they get. Surprise, surprise here. Who is the third biggest caap nets? Congenita. Well, of course that's the United Kingdom.

Speaker 1:          11:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:28          Shane's at will no longer be a member of the club. As you can imagine, this leaves a whole of more than a 12 billion euros. This is why many are suggesting that other countries have to start paying more to keep the spending where it used to be.

Speaker 1:          11:44          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:45          Pin Commission urges you countries to pay more into budget nonetheless, who really wants to pay more. It's a time when you're a skeptic are stronger than ever and no politician can really come back to his own country and say, hey, guess what guys? Without your wallet, because we got to pay more for being in the EU. It's not going to go down well. So if you do the math, you realize that there's only really one option. Yeah. Musters plans. It's payments to Europe's biggest farms, basically Europe hat to reduce the direct aid given to the farmers. And they've started with the wealthiest ones since they're the ones who needed them the least. But the biggest surprise came with Emmanuel macron speech. Everybody in Brussels might expect from stupid come out as the biggest old school crp supporter. Right? Let's mcallen. Well, he's got other priorities and this means a green light to cut aid in the future. Meanwhile, trade deals being struck in fashion. Ooh. And Mexico agreed to new free trade pact. Yes. Yes. He has someone not only talking about Mexico here, I mean look at this new,

Speaker 1:          12:53          yes,

Speaker 2:          12:56          pn union rush to promote. It's preliminary free trade agreement with Japan by stressing the benefits for you farmers. Yes, stiff us slowly. The European Union is reducing subsidies, reducing tariffs and getting rid of production quotas and I know what you're probably thinking right now. You're thinking, come on Simon. A, you're rarely telling us that brexit is the only reason for this change. Well, no, I'm Saturday. In fact, there are two other important reasons. On the one hand is European agriculture is already more productive than elsewhere. This video we told you about the Netherlands being one of the biggest agricultural powerhouses. In fact, they have what we call the food silicon valley.

Speaker 1:          13:36          Okay?

Speaker 2:          13:37          In fact is of bad. She is or Ribera del Duero wine can be found almost everywhere and they all come from Europe. In other words, you're a, doesn't need to protect its own markets anymore, but instead sign lots of trade deals and I know what you might be thinking right now. We'll farmers be happy when they stop getting all of these subsidies from Brussels. Well, the reality is no, but the question really is, does actually matter. Look, peasants unions, they used to have a big political grip during the 60s when the goal was the French president. France had millions of people working in the primary sector. Now their ons, even 3% of the population working there. This means way less political sway and weighed us votes. But not only that, who do you think these European farmers vote for? Francis disillusioned farmers turn to Le Pen. Exactly. Basically the biggest place for euroskeptic parties to get their votes are rural areas where farmers live. So if you're a European politician and he wants to make your vote as happy, you're really kind of do want to pay more attention to the urban europeanist voters instead of the rural euro skeptic ones and come on now because the average city guy, they don't know what the caap even. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Is,

Speaker 2:          14:56          and this leads us to our question for you. Does the CAAP have any future whatsoever in Europe? Will we see greater liberalization of agriculture in Europe as well as the rest of the world? Well, please leave your answer in the comment section below.
