Speaker 1:          00:08          Does he know there is a country in South America when most of its population are of Indian origin and where the official language is English. Now, if you don't know which country I'm talking about, don't worry because this is one of the least known countries in the region, and to be fair, the media doesn't really pay that much attention to it, so really small as a country that the media don't talk about very much. Well, that sounds like the perfect ingredients for a visual politic. Talking about Guyana that owns British colony, who didn't get independence until 1966. Interestingly at the moment of independence, both the government's [inaudible] popular opinion was generally in favor of turning guy on it into a socialist country. It was this mindset which gave the country. It's Pinto ask official name, the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, but let's focus on the country today. Diana is one of the poorest countries in South America and violence rates that are some of the highest in the entire region, and that's saying a lot. In fact, if going on, it is known for anything, it would be for its place in the international supply of cocaine. Oh, and also for having one of the highest suicide rates in the world, so not exactly brilliant things. Now, with all of this information, you'd be forgiven for not being optimistic about the future of this Caribbean country, but they may be about to get a lot luckier.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Oh yeah. Signs pointed to. Guiana becoming an oil power for there's only being this small republic with a population of about 750,000 inhabitants has already got the attention and dollars of multinational companies such as Exxon or

Speaker 2:          02:04          that's

Speaker 1:          02:04          after several years exploring the area. On January the 13th, 2017 things to powerful oil companies announced the discovery of water they think could be one of the most significant oil and gas reserves found decades. Oil reserves have been found in deep waters in the scene. Menzel under the coastal waters of Deanna early calculations estimate that the amount of oil which can be exploited in the country is no less than 4,000 million barrels and many experts from this could be a much larger quantity, so it seems that this country holds a huge fortune just off it's shores. That's the question really is how much is this all really worth considering the price of oil nowadays, we're talking about roughly $200,000,000,000, so leaving other natural resources asides and considering only petrol. This would result in the equivalent of $250,000 per citizen. And it's important to note that the oil reserves can be much bigger than the early calculations in. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:06          no,

Speaker 1:          03:07          it is true that oil exploitation is expensive and requires enormous investments, but this could still be the first step in a new era of prosperity 40 on it. So far of the oil companies I've mentioned Exxon mobile and has have committed to investing $900,000,000 a year in Ghana over the next few years. The government is investing to with plans to start exporting oil in 20, 20. This means Guiana, it could be on the cusp of becoming one of the greatest economic developments that South America has ever.

Speaker 2:          03:46          Yes,

Speaker 1:          03:47          Ghana, that poor violence country. You could become the kinds of country which other people in South America who are unemployed might look at and think, I want to change my life. I once opportunities, I want to go to Ghana. Ghana could become that big hope for many. I'm employed South American people. Nevertheless, before they start packing a, we have to say that it's not going to be that easy. The road ahead is going to be fraught with difficulties.

Speaker 2:          04:15          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:17          with Venezuela,

Speaker 2:          04:19          much better.

Speaker 1:          04:20          The oil exploration is happening in areas that have been claimed by Venezuela and is the part they have claimed is not exactly small Madora who considers the region known as Guiana asset. [inaudible] burned to be vast and this region represents more than 70 percent of

Speaker 2:          04:35          surface,

Speaker 1:          04:37          so essentially Venezuela is claiming the entire country as their own and as if this wasn't bad enough and other area which makes up seven percent of its territory is claimed by their neighbors in Suriname. If their neighbors had their way, Guiana would have been carved up and split between them a long time ago. The thing is this conflict over territory seemed to have been forgotten for years. This was likely a consequence of the good relations that the government's kept with Cuba, a country that holds a lot of influence over this part of the world. It was also likely because Venezuela wanted the support of organizations such as Caricom, the Caribbean Community of which Guiana is a member. So now you might be wondering, is Agi on a Caribbean country or is it a South American country? Well, it's sort of both geographically speaking, the country is in South America, but politically, culturally and socially speaking. Guiana is a Caribbean country. In fact, Guiana was one of the countries which used to benefits from petro an initiative by Hugo Chavez that we're supplying cheap, high quality oil to those countries which were deemed France, but it all changed when on May the 11th of 2005, the left wing governments of the People's Progressive Party lost the general election to a coalition headed by their new president, David granger. A man who was closer to Washington and who to end once and for all the claims coming from

Speaker 3:          06:00          way less,

Speaker 1:          06:04          it was at that moment that the long ignored conflict to defrost it and things really started to heat up.

Speaker 3:          06:10          It's still carrying a monkey on its back. That monkey is the unbearable burden of an oppressive and obnoxious Cleveland on land and sea space.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Now, the conflict is in the hands of the United Nations, but whatever the solution might be, if there is any, it's important to be aware of this threat to the potential prosperous future after gone.

Speaker 2:          06:34          Racial conflict.

Speaker 1:          06:36          Important risk is the recurrence. Racial conflicts in Guyana, which is a continuous presence in the countries media. Deanna is a complex country demographically around 50 percent of its population is of Indian origin, while 40 percent is of African origin. Those are two big groups who are not exactly on the friendliest of terms. In fact, the black minority claims that for years the Indian majority has obtained privileges from the government and always got that way. This is triggered recurrence waves of violence. Luckily the situation seems to have improved. In fact is the winning coalition, governments is quite multiracial.

Speaker 1:          07:19          There is still the possibility that further internal conflict will flare up in any case, not only does this new governments have an opportunity to overcome decades of conflict, it's once and for all, but it's also being looked to to find violence and corruption in the country, something that Ganas certainly needs to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world according to Transparency International. So the new government has quite a few major tasks ahead of them, oil exploitation, as well as the fight against corruption and criminality and the country. The thing is, if they achieved their goals, Guiana will attract great attention and me become one of the richest countries in South America, but this will only be if they use their resources well, but the question is will that happen? And it's certainly a big question. So we've given you our opinion, here are visual politics and now we'd love to know what you think.

Speaker 1:          08:06          Do you think Guiana will successfully take advantage of their newly discovered oil and what position do you think Venezuela should adopt?
