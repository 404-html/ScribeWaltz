Speaker 1:          00:08          Donald trump, president of the United States and the world's most powerful man. A lot has been said about his auntie liberal agenda, but the question today is can he really put it all into place? The bigger question here, the how powerful is the presidents of the United States? Really?

Speaker 2:          00:25          Let's have a look at it

Speaker 1:          00:25          as an example, Donald Trump would get up one morning and launched a couple of nuclear warheads to another country without passing. A congress can listen, is all the supreme court stop the massive deportations that he's proposed during his campaign. Don't forget, it's a democracy in the United States, congratulates itself Fur. It's clear distinction between executive judicial and legislative branches. This system of checks and balances once designed to prevent an eventual psychopath from taking over the country and it's creating chaos like seizing the power that he was given, buying the citizen with this system in place. The presidents of the United States or Otis has a lot of authority to do things unilaterally without having to ask permission of any court parliaments and believe you me, some of these things are pretty darn scary today. In this video, we're going to tell you about some of the things that Donald Trump can do by himself and we're doing it along with our friend Eric [inaudible]. Eric is the cofounder of reconsider media, one of the most influential political podcasts in America.

Speaker 3:          01:29          Hello Simon and hello to all the visual politics subscribers. That's the nuclear football exists.

Speaker 1:          01:40          The answer is, Oh yes, it does, because when you play Football, Aka the Doomsday Boston does exist. In fact, it's carried in the briefcase that we're showing in the picture.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:57          President presses that button. He's sending an order to to US army officials. Usually lieutenants were stationed aboard a combat jet that has a nuclear weapon. Each of these lieutenants has a key. When they turned those keys, at the same time they deploy and launch the nuclear weapon.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Be Wondering, is it required that Congress passed a law or some kind of special order in order to launch that nuke, and the answer is a resounding no. The presidents can give the order to launch and you just about any time he wants. Just like

Speaker 3:          02:34          resident could push the button all by himself or herself legally and constitutionally speaking, physically, military personnel would need to carry out the strike. Of course, any military officer ignoring a presidential order would be an opening subordination subject to dismissal and court martialed.

Speaker 1:          03:00          All of this comes from the time of the Cold War. The United States felt existentially threatened by the Soviet Union. They worried that eventually the Soviets would be able to nuke any American city at any time. If this would be the case, the United States. We need to be able to react with the retaliatory strike immediately. There wouldn't be time for debate in the House of Representatives.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Hold on a minute here because there is much more. Imagine Donald Trump wakes up one morning and Zinzi isn't a big fan of the Chinese people. He decides to launch a new gas in Beijing. From a legal and constitutional point of view, he is allowed to do so, but this isn't going to be for free. In this example, launching a bombing against China would violate several international treaties as well as agreements between the United States and China. This means the US Congress would ask him for an explanation or even call for a vote to decide whether he should be kicked out of the Oval Office or not. This is a process called impeachment and it comes into effect when the president's breaks a law, including treaties that the US has agreed to. Former presidents like Richard Nixon are rather familiar with this process. This is not the ends of things though because there is far more than nukes in America's arsenal and a state of emergency, so can Donald Trump declare war on another country all by himself? However, in cases of emergency, the president can actually send troops into another country without a declaration of war by Congress ahead of time. Here's thing

Speaker 2:          04:48          example,

Speaker 1:          04:52          President Obama is facing criticism that crosses the political divide for not seeking congressional authorization before ordering the American military to join in attacks, tax of Libyan earth defenses and government forces. This means that if trump wanted to send troops to a country like Iran, for example, you can absolutely do it, but you can only do it for 60 days. After that 60 day period, he has to report to Congress and gets a vote declaring war. This would mean an extended military presence in the territory, so this means that you can send troops to a country if it's an emergency, but you can't send them there if you want them to stay for longer. In that case, you do need Congress to approve this. Nonetheless, once Congress has declared a declaration of war, the president has the power to micromanage the war, however they want. Nonetheless, once Congress has passed a declaration of war, the president as commander in chief has the power to micromanage the war, however they can.

Speaker 2:          05:53          Nonetheless.

Speaker 1:          05:54          Last one is congress has passed a declaration of war. The president is unable to micromanage the warfare, the as much as he wants. This means the president can give very specific and detailed orders. If you remember the capture of Osama bin Laden that was directed by President Obama in self, and then there they're also the many drone strikes. The President Obama also watered himself. Let's now move on from warfare and let's talk a little bit about economics.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Well, to the free trade agreements, when it comes to the economy, almost all domestic policies do you have to go through congress. If Donald trump wants to raise taxes, it would require a legislative votes. The same happens if he wants to liberalize one industry or nationalized another. In many cases, he might face the Supreme Court or even individual states who have their own power to stop some actions and that's something we're actually going to be covering in an upcoming video. Nonetheless, that is an area where Donald Trump will have power to act. However you want international trade agreements, and this is really no small matter, US companies buy and sell goods and services all over the world, and these commercial relationships are regulated through international agreements.

Speaker 4:          07:04          Yes,

Speaker 1:          07:08          many governments have special taxes which are called tariffs on foreign goods. In order to avoid these countries can sign what they call a free trade agreement.

Speaker 3:          07:18          You're in North America, we have the Nafta Treaty or the North American Free Trade Association, which allows for forms of free trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Now this law is 20 years old and because it's already on the books, Donald Trump cannot unilaterally break it or change it in any major way. You would need congress to pass a new law in order to make change.

Speaker 1:          07:46          Nevertheless, they're all two other big treaties that were negotiated by Barack Obama that are still to be passed through congress. The first is the TPP. This allows a form of free trade between America and Asia and Oceania. The other risk of the TT ip which opens commerce with the European Union. These treaties were almost done. They just needed to be passed by the American Congress as well as the legislative bodies of some other countries. However, the American constitution says that any president can renegotiate or cancel any international treaties before they have been voted on by Congress, and even if they were approved by the legislature, you could still choose not to sign it if he didn't sign it. This would be called a veto, and as you probably well know, trump is no big fan of free trade and the TPP failed.

Speaker 5:          08:32          GPP is a horrible deal. It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It's a deal that was designed for China to come in as they always do through the backdoor and truck. Totally take advantage of everyone.

Speaker 3:          08:47          In fact, the president can veto any law passed by Congress, however, he can only veto the whole law or and send it back to Congress. He cannot pick and choose what parts of the Walgett past once it's sent back to Congress. If Congress wants to pass it over the veto, they would have to vote for it with a two thirds majority, but of course,

Speaker 1:          09:10          the main area where Donald Trump would like to use this super as presidents is

Speaker 2:          09:19          great.

Speaker 1:          09:20          This was the most hated, yes, most repeated word in donald trump's speeches during his entire election campaign. Nonetheless, he almost has no executive powers with which and can act on this matter

Speaker 3:          09:30          in order to build the wall. Trump actually needs congressional approval because at the end of the day, it's a major civil construction projects, so it needs a budget which congress passes and it also needs big land allocations, which he needs Congress to acquire as well. If he's going to build the wall without the permission of any other American institution, he actually has to get not only Mexico to pay for the wall, but also to build the wall with in their own border.

Speaker 1:          10:01          This is again something that we're going to be talking about lazy

Speaker 1:          10:09          now, the American system only that's trump. Do one thing or to the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize the deportation of illegal immigrants, but you know what's particularly interesting about this and what the problem is, and that's the Boma. Well, he already did that. Doesn't had Obama Administration so strange as it sounds when it comes to illegal immigration. Trump's administration is expected to follow the steps of it promise. This is our opinion here. Revisional, politic, and now we'd love to know what you think. Do you think that the president should be able to meet so many unilateral decisions without having to go through Congress? You think it's kind of scary that one person has the authority, didn't nuke whatever country you'd wants? Well, you can let us know what you think by leaving us a comment below.
