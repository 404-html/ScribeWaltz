Speaker 1:          00:07          Imagine in a country with a population of Manhattan, but with huge reserves of oil and gas, the country surrounded by the wealthiest oil rich monarchies, or am I talking about? Well, that would be Bahrain so tiny that we almost can't see it on the map. Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. Life must be wonderful hair, right? Money for everybody. A prosperous economy and amazing growth. Right? Well, the opposite is in fact, true

Speaker 1:          00:44          brain downgraded to junk as political crackdown continues unabated. Yeah, you heard that right? Bahrain debt is considered to be a junk bonds on the international market. This means investors are so hesitant about their economy that they don't believe Bahrain. We'll be able to give back those loans. The truth is things in Bahrain, they're getting really, really sour. If you've followed visual politic for a long time, you already know that within the Islamic world there are two big groups, Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims and well, they really hate each other. As you know, Saudi Arabia is something like the Sunni Muslim Hollywood and the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the same, but for the sheer Muslims, this is why they've been in a state of cold war for decades,

Speaker 2:          01:34          but

Speaker 1:          01:34          in the context of this Cold War, Bahrain is actually in the funniest position of all. Basically in this country, the majority of the population is Shia Muslim. At the Royal House that rules the country is Sunni Muslim. This is why that monarchs stuff turns political oppression into something of an art form. All right, so so far nothing in this video has probably surprised you're that much. But then again, the title of this video is why Bahrain rain could become the world's wealthiest country or something like that. Honestly, at the time of recording, we haven't actually decided the title of this video, but so why don't we say something like that? Well, because of this rate discovers largest oil field in countries since 1932. Yes, dear viewer. They already had dinosaur juice, but now they have even more. Basically Bahrain could have more oil than Russia and with a fraction of Russia's population, so basically this means that there are less people to split the money with, but the question is, is this enough to be the wealthiest country on the planet?

Speaker 1:          02:39          Why even with sonar trial, are Bahrain's data barns still considered to be junk? What the hell is going on in Bahrain? Well, today we are going to answer all of those questions, but as always, let's take a look back at the history cage. All right. If any of you out there, once it become a dictator one day, here are some pro tips. Basically, there are two ways to make people follow you. The first one, good old oppression. The problem with that though is that if you go too crazy with the oppression, you're gonna risk. A popular uprising and maybe ending up with Gaddafi. There was a band that involved. It's not a good time. Don't watch that video. We've told you thousands of times, Aaron visual politics, being a dictator is a risky job. Not many of them go and die of old age.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Sure,

Speaker 1:          03:34          but there is an alternative and it's healthier and it's more sustainable and is what we're calling the money for nothing. Strategy. Basically you shower all of your citizens in gold if that wealthy and they don't need to get a job, they don't worry about politics. All right, so the Al Khalifa family, the ruling family in Bahrain has combined both of these methods in a very effective fashion. In fact, the prime minister who happens to be the kings uncle, holds the world record for the longest lasting ruler. He has been in power since 1971. Nonetheless, how can I Sunni Muslim families stay in power for such a long time in the country with a sheer majority population? Well, let's be honest, before we have the good old iron fist protest against the government, hey, great. You'll automatically be considered a terrorist. You'll go to jail and you're probably either be given the death penalty or exiles, and we're not talking about an isolated example here. This is something that happens. Every single rain strips 115 of nationality over terrorism allocations. Over 700 people in Bahrain have had their citizenship revoked since 2010.

Speaker 2:          04:54          Well,

Speaker 1:          04:59          and yes, I know what you're going to say. Oh, come on, Simon. Don't be such a snowflake and other democratic countries that Retalia citizenship too, and of course, well, you're right, but the difference is the proportions. For example, in the United Kingdom there are some examples, sure, but in fall rain we're talking about hundreds are so now you might say, well, things are changing Simon. I mean the world is evolving. The Middle East, it's getting more modern. Well, I'm sorry to say, but in this case, that's not true at all. In fact, the opposite is true. In 2011, the Shia citizens took to the streets as part of the Arabs,

Speaker 2:          05:35          right?

Speaker 1:          05:40          Rabia, along with the United Arab Emirates sent troops to help the Bahraini government to suppress these demonstrations. Today, one out of every 500 people in Bahrain are political prisoners among them, many leaders, but on any of that, since 2011 Bahrain passed new laws to make it easier to retire one citizenship. And believe me, losing Bahraini citizenship is a big shame. Citizenship means that you lose all of your rights.

Speaker 2:          06:11          Yes,

Speaker 1:          06:13          you'll have to give up your passport, your driver's license. You cannot own a house, a car, a phone, or a bank account. You cannot marry in the country. And if you decide to leave, you cannot go back. If you happen to stay well, you can't leave. In summary, opposing the government tends you into a second class citizen and well, this is a big shame because being a first lawsuit as an embodied brain, it's actually pretty great. And this, this is where that money for nothing policy comes into play. This is what we call Bahrain's social contract. Basically, if you forget about politics, you don't have to worry about anything looking for a job, you can get one. Even the governments, don't worry, nobody's going to check if you even go to the office,

Speaker 1:          06:58          need to pick up some things in the supermarket. Don't worry. Everything is super cheap because it's all subsidized. Need fuel for your car. Well, that's also crazy cheap. All right, so now you might be wondering, well, what happens if I don't want to work for the government, Simon? I don't like it. I want to work in a private business. Well still, no problem. The government guarantees quotas for local workers, so no immigrants is gonna take away your job. This is actually the funniest part of all the immigrant quote. Basically they're there to reserve the coolest jobs for the local.

Speaker 2:          07:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:31          For example, 50 percent of bank workers have to be from Bahrain in the cool, fancy shops. It's 30 percent, but construction work as well. That's just five. Why? Because he wants to lay bricks under the hot bar, rainy son. This is why it 55 percent of the Bahraini population are immigrants and they are the ones who actually get the countries work done and well, to be fair, I need to make an aside here. Look, having more immigrants than locals is very common in the Middle East. For example, foreign citizens make up 75 percent of Qatar's population, but Bahrain is a pioneer in another way. They are one of the few countries that ban the socorro and so. Well, what is the godfather roller balance? Well, this is a sort of modern day slavery. The Catholicism links foreign workers with a national who is that patron? This patron can decide whether the immigrants can change his or her job or even leave the country at all. So well. Bahrain has actually abolished this inhuman practice so. Well that's good. Nonetheless, despite all of this, what you might wonder as well kind of country where nobody works actually prosper and the answer is, well of course not

Speaker 1:          08:45          $120 living without working is expensive. They already manages in Bahrain because of one thing, oil makes up more than 60 percent of their exports in 75 percent of the government's income. Plus in order to cover all of the costs, the government needs the oil barrel price at $120 less than that. They didn't make enough profit to make ends meet. And now you might be wondering, well, is $120 too much or too little? Well look at it's historic.

Speaker 2:          09:21          That happens

Speaker 1:          09:22          in July of 2008 when oil was $147, but as you know, in 2014 oil prices fell in January 2016, they went down a dozen little as $26. And this explains news like

Speaker 2:          09:36          yes,

Speaker 1:          09:40          p cuts Bahrain rating b plus. So what did they do with low prices and lack of income. Of course they took on more and more debt and the results it speaks for itself. In just two years, public debt has gone from seven percent to 70 percent and despite crude oil prices going up again, it seems pretty unlikely that it will reach $120 a barrel anytime soon. So far Bahrain has already revoked subsidies on meat products and. Well this is only the beginning.

Speaker 1:          10:12          We'll introduce VAT by end of 2018 says finance minister. Yeah. You had that right. In Bahrain there is no income tax and so far they didn't even have indirect taxation, but the situation is desperate and they need to create a new taxes that simply didn't even exist before. But what does this mean for Bar rain? Well, do you remember how this particular authoritarian rule works? Well, they've sheer population except Sony oppression in exchange for money for nothing. So when the economics fail, politics fails to now only a miracle can save the outcome for family and well, that miracle is this one oil miracle so far, Bahrain produces 200,000 barrels a day. This is nothing compared with the tens of millions in Saudi Arabia. But it's insane when we take into account in the country's size, as I said before, Bahrain has just discovered a big old oil that. And they could start pumping dinosaur juice in as little as five years according to optimistic analysts. This could double production and ends the deficit problem. Alright, so this all sounds fantastic and wonderful. So what exactly is the problem? Well, if you watch visual politic often you probably have guessed and that's that not every type of oil costs the same to extract.

Speaker 2:          11:37          And

Speaker 1:          11:37          this new oil that has all the ingredients needed to be very, very expensive. First of all, it's underwater. That means that Bahrain has to build platforms on the sea floor. Second is shale oil, which means it's under a rock. You need fracking technology to break that rock and that fracking is really expensive.

Speaker 1:          11:58          In this chart you can see the cost of production of a barrel of oil in different countries. We don't know how much fracking would cost in Bahrain, but we can look to see how much it costs. For example, in the United States, if you pay attention to the chart, you can see that fracking, shale oil is significantly more expensive than extracting oil in more conventional methods. If Bahrain wants to make a profit, the barrels should cost over $60, but since they need a huge profit to cover all of their expenses, they need an even higher market price. So wait a second. What? What can save Bahrain from ruin? Well, the answer is the same as other Middle Eastern countries and that's diversification. They need to produce other things that's not just oil and this explains news.

Speaker 2:          12:42          Yes,

Speaker 1:          12:47          La opens $90, million dollar factory of the future in Bahrain, but of course if you really want to attract business from other industries, you need something other than oil beds. You need rule of law, you need clear taxes and you need a government that doesn't send people to jail without a trial. We've told you several times on this channel do buying and generally speaking, the United Arab Emirates started down this path of years ago. Now Saudi Arabia, it's probably going to follow suit, although we're not really sure about that. And look, it's only a matter of time before Bahrain's dance doing the same, but of course, if those economic reforms mean that the Bahraini people have to pay taxes or even, you know, work hard than the ruling family is going to be in. Right?

Speaker 1:          13:32          So the big question now becomes, do you think the Bahraini citizens are going to accept such an authoritarian governments? If they no longer enjoying the money for nothing policy, do you think they're going to find a way to reform the system while please leave your onset in the comment section below?
