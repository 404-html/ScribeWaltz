Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:09          1945

Speaker 3:          00:11          sorry, 53,000 ton flagship of Admiral Halsey becomes the scene of an unforgettable ceremony marking the complete and primal surrender of Japan.

Speaker 2:          00:24          On August the 15th of 1945 having suffered the only nuclear bomb attack in history only a few days previously for Japanese government's finally surrendered.

Speaker 4:          00:36          Ash Supreme Commander for the allied powers. I announced my firm in the tradition of the country that I represent crocheted and the discharge if my responsibilities while taking all national, sorry, just position to ensure at the term surrender our pull, a pump play and faithfully complied with.

Speaker 2:          01:08          At that moment, Japan was the defeated country. Its economy was shattered in the Japanese. It's suffered unimaginable damage. Not only were they immersed in extreme poverty, they had also lost more than 3 million compatriots, brothers, sons, even mothers wore it. Takes a terrible toll with this grim picture is the situation in 1945 the question that we might ask ourselves is, well, how did Japan managed to become one of the greatest economic powers on the planet in such a short amount of time? And how did the Japanese recover so quickly with such might.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:49          Dev you out here on visual politic, we've already talked about the differences between the German model and the Japanese model. We've also told you about how Japan transformed from a Med eval country to a thriving modern nation. However, we still need to answer the question of how Japan managed to become a great wells power interest a few years. Let me tell you right now for the Japanese model is rather peculiar, so we're going to need more than one video to explain it here in this video, we're going to see a few brush strokes in the whole picture that don't worry. More chapters are absolutely going

Speaker 1:          02:20          falling.

Speaker 2:          02:27          The post war 45 it seemed like everything that had been built after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 I simply evaporated. Moreover, as if that weren't enough for the first time in its history, Japan was occupied by the United States.

Speaker 1:          02:46          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:47          Hold on for just a second because it wasn't all bad news. As we'll see. The Japanese also had three aces up their sleeves, three characteristics that would launch their country into the stratosphere, turning us into one of the richest countries on the planet. And that's all in spite of the many political mistakes that both the occupation forces and the local authorities would make over the coming year. So you want to know what the three ingredients where the main ingredients of this Japanese success recipe? Well, first of all, a huge ability and his predilection for saving you see in Asian countries in general in Japan, is no exception. Family is trying to save every penny and much more so than almost any other place on it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:38          Why? While there are many explanations for this phenomena, cultural preference, trends towards less consumption in the present, in order to spend more in the future, or just because of a lack of public services, which tend to be very limited in this part of the world. All of these explanations may have a bit of truth to them, but regardless, these huge amounts of savings all then invested, which creates productive capital, that obviously leads to higher production and 12th level.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Yes,

Speaker 2:          04:08          savings that allow us to direct our efforts for a long time. Not to satisfy our immediate needs, but to worry about satisfying or future needs. We produce capital goods so that they in turn, manufacturer the future consumer goods we may need Juan Ramon Ryo. Alright. So the first days that Japan had up its sleeve after the war was an enormous propensity to save savings, savings, and just bought savings. The second, it had a lot to do with the Meiji Restoration of 18

Speaker 1:          04:37          the yes,

Speaker 2:          04:40          you'll see as we saw her in a previous video, one of the first things the Japanese government did after the regime change was bet on creating a very powerful educational system. They established universal primary education and promoted universities, academies, research centers, et Cetera. Thus after the second world war, despite their situation, the Japanese were the most well trained workers on the entire Asian continent. And of course this entails a huge competitive advantage.

Speaker 1:          05:08          Sure.

Speaker 2:          05:12          So one of the first measures taken after the war was pushing the educational system even further. And so what's the third card? Well, is the one you can probably guess. And that's the Japanese is huge capacity and willingness for working long hours and in some cases they've even taken things ranked to the extreme. I mean, do you know any other country in the world and it has a word for death from working too much Karoshi death from working too much is a public health problem in Japan. The fact is that all three of these factors, they gave Japan a huge capacity to recover, grow and create a great deal of wealth. But hold on a second because while having seen all of this, what exactly are the stages that Japan goes through in order for this economic miracle to happen? Well, listen up

Speaker 5:          05:57          day,

Speaker 1:          05:58          no,

Speaker 2:          06:01          the stages, the process we're about to explore starts with the u s is occupation of Japan. After the end of the war. See, the occupation forces had two major priorities. Do you demilitarize and democratize Japan? It's around this time, for example, that the new constitution establishing a democratic system was created. It equalized men's and women's rights and it stripped to Japan if it's right to wage war, dismantling its armed forces. In addition to the occupation forces copied us institutions and launched reforms that had some benefits and any drawbacks.

Speaker 2:          06:37          One day we're going to need to talk about how badly the military has always managed the economy of countries they've controls, but that's something we'll deal with in a future video. The fact is that the priority of these reforms was to eliminate, or at least to reduce the power of the auto. Oxy supported Japanese expansionism and militarism to do so. The sale of lands from big landowners to small farmers. It was approved measures were taken to dissolve these I babbsu large business groups. There's engaged in many activities, but we're controlled by a single family and antitrust law that outlawed monopolies was also passed in 1947 and the unionization of workers was also promoted. Everything was done with the intention of achieving an economic power chain.

Speaker 1:          07:17          Of course,

Speaker 2:          07:17          some of these measures, in addition to limiting the power of the great oligarchs also had some rather positive consequences. For example, the land of distribution managed to turn many farmers into owners need demise of many of these. I've soup to the emergence of many small and medium sized enterprises. In spite of everything the recovery, it was much slower than expected. However, in the 1950s the country has is as it were, a stroke of luck. The Korean War Tan Japan into one of the alliance forces suppliers there by boosting their exports and that production southern leave, Japanese companies and politicians, they discovered the great global market

Speaker 1:          07:54          gets

Speaker 2:          07:56          in 1953 production level says already suppose to levels that have been right before the war and as the minutes of class had a new priority boosting economic growth through business.

Speaker 2:          08:14          The economic takeoff folks, the decades of the fifties sixties and seventies miraculous years, they were Japan's golden age. It was a time led by the Liberal Democratic Party, a political party that ruled the country for almost 40 uninterrupted years. A few years ago. By the way, it was discovered that the CIA actually gave a lot of money to support the party's political campaigns. This is also the party of the current Prime Minister Shinzo our bay. The fact is that this party launched a very peculiar system. See, on the one hand, it promoted policies that favored keeping inflation under control and slowing down the growth of the public sector as well as maintaining low taxes and avoiding the accumulation of debt. This is the opposite of what they do in countries like Argentina or obesity, for example.

Speaker 2:          09:13          However, hold on just a second because that's not all. Now, on the other hand, unlike what happens in other countries that achieved great economic takeoff, the truth is that these governments, they were quite interventionalist, for example, they decided to promote certain industries which they themselves chosen, which they helped grow from within the government itself. They also promoted a new counter lization of national companies supposedly to avoid what they considered to be excessive competition. Although you know, I don't really know her, but that just sure sounds like a way for them to help out their friends regardless. It did have amazing results. In the early 1960s Prime Minister High Eto Keytar announced a plan to double the size of Japan's economy in just 10 years to reach this goal of the country needed to maintain an annual average growth rate of 7.2% for that entire time. International analysts considered it impossible. 10 years later, Japan had far exceeded its goal. The country had Moza blind the size of its economy by 2.8 because he did an average annual growth rate of more than 9.3%

Speaker 1:          10:20          okay,

Speaker 2:          10:21          Dustin? 1973 the Japanese economy had multiplied more than five since 1953 that is in just 20 years on the other hand, GDP per capita and multiplied by four and within a few years, Japan became the largest asset holder in the world and the largest humanitarian aid provider, even the Tokyo Stock Exchange managed to outperform the New York Stock Exchange for a short period of time. But you know what? This is when a great controversy arose. I want to cite some defended the country spectacular growth despite all of these government policies. That is to say that the three things we covered at the beginning of this video savings work and training was so strong that they managed to take off in spite of the government's interference, but some argue that since the government caps the macro economic parameters under control of these public policies actually accelerated the country is great.

Speaker 2:          11:17          Well, now the only question is which one do you think is right? Which group do you belong to? While leave your answer in the comments section below and also in this survey, what there's little doubt about though is that it was exactly during that time that some of the greatest imbalances that lead the country into a huge crisis from which it hasn't yet recovered emerged, but we already talked about that in this previous other video.
