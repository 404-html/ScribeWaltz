Speaker 1:          00:09          The US president. Donald Trump has an idea that he won't get off on how you determined link continues to unleash his own world. War in this case, say commercial war against the rest of the world

Speaker 2:          00:20          with a bank that everybody's stealing from. Well, I respect China and I respect President Xi, but they've been killing us,

Speaker 1:          00:28          convinced that the United States is being harmed and even Robert in its trade relations. In recent months, Donald Trump has launched a tough protectionist policy and as multiplied tariffs from now on, billions of dollars in imported products by the United States will have to face the heavy tariffs that this administration has approved is essentially the economic he revolutions of by these American products or else you're not a true patriot. Welcome to the 1930s apparently. The fact is that during July, 2018 new tariffs are going to come into effect of no less than 25% on products that the United States imports each year from China, which is worth about $50 billion. By the way. Additionally, just a few months ago, the White House place tariffs on Steel Alemanian minium solar panels, even washing machine imports sort. Of course, that is not all her at all. Trump has already sat plans on the table to implement many more tariffs really soon. The following will be set at the end of August, so check this out.

Speaker 1:          01:35          US unveils additional tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports. It's not going to question, have you ever played monopoly or risk? Well, we could see that in the eyes of the American president and this whole thing is kind of like a board game and as he is Donald Trump, he's really not willing to lose hair game. Is Trump the game that game where you, everything you ever wanted to own, win or lose weight? Yeah, I think you'll like it. Now we move onto the question. Is it really going to be that simple? Will the US presidents plans be fulfilled and we'll via economy be strengthened by this type of policy? These aren't really the important questions here for now. We know the Donald Trump's speech is beginning to make many American multinationals very nervous. I don't think this is going to get resolved easily and I think these terrorists are going to hurt the u s economy. Rufus York, Sa President of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents multinationals such as Coca Cola, Ford and Microsoft because fall from what was promised, the first victims are the American people themselves. This an op.

Speaker 3:          02:49          Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:49          broken dreams. The Whitehouse repeatedly insists that this new policy aims to boost US companies. However, before trump supporters begin to celebrate. Just hold on a second because there are some things that the president is not taking into account. The first is that the vast majority of tariffs are being applied on intermediate and capital goods. That is goods that company important to manufacture their products in the United States. Therefore, one of two things is happening. Either you pay the tariff or you start buying in other markets, even assuming that it's possible in the United States itself. In any case, this implies a higher cost of production, which evidently reduces US companies competitive. Now,

Speaker 1:          03:39          this is, for example, the case of midcontinent nail that a Missouri company that is the largest producer of nails in the United States. After trump approved tariffs on foreign steel, they had to lay off 60 of their 500 employees and everything points to it being forced. You close or transfer its entire production to Mexico. This is a company that works, is a company that created employment that was the competitive in the free market and that now do you have to, Washington's interference is falling apart. Then the second issue, which I'm sure won't surprise any of you peers that other countries, I'm not just going to simply accepts these tariffs and be like, ah, it's cool. In order to defend the core interests of the country and the interests of the people, we are forced to retaliate statement of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the European Union, Canada and Mexico said that they will respond to new US tariffs on steel. Linda aluminum with punitive measures targeting American products worth billions of dollars. These other countries, they going to react and they're basically going to say, guys, if you're going to set tariffs, uh, we're going to get on that too. And this is something that just goes on and on and it really shouldn't be like that, but it's simply is. And really the consequences. They don't take a long time to arrive.

Speaker 1:          05:01          Holly Davidson, the popular motorcycle manufacturer and one of the great icons in the U S and check it out, trump himself is actually a fan, has now announced that it will transfer parts of its production from its US factories to new factories located in Europe.

Speaker 3:          05:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:17          You see, when trump punish the European Union with tariffs on steel and Alan Minium, they responded with more tariffs of their own. For example, they increased the tariff on imports of motorcycles, manufacturers in the United States from 6% to 31% so, well, what does this all mean? Well, on average, that means about $2,200 extra for every motorcycle.

Speaker 4:          05:40          Some of it suggesting we should protect American companies from foreign competition. I don't believe the American people are afraid of competition. That was made clear to me when I visited a Harley Davidson plant recently. When you hear talk about a tough trade bill, remember that being tough on trade and commerce, the of the economy,

Speaker 5:          05:58          one of the worst possible consequences for the consumer and the American worker as I told them at the Harley Davidson plant, it's time to gum. The engine's not put on the brakes.

Speaker 1:          06:07          This is a cost which evidently European motorcycle manufacturers such as BMW do not have to face and thanks to a commercial agreements between the European Union and Japan. Neither will a Yamaha Kawasaki or Honda, which are by the way, Harley Davidson's main competitors.

Speaker 5:          06:28          This is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs. The best way to help American workers, consumers, and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market. Ashley Strong a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan,

Speaker 1:          06:43          and as you might imagine taking donald trump's character ncu accounts. This news made him angry and the even threatens the company itself by twitter. Of course,

Speaker 5:          06:54          leave Davidson. It should never be built in another country. Never. Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end. They surrendered, they quit. The aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before.

Speaker 1:          07:09          President of the threatening and damaging the image of a large American companies simply for making business decisions that could save them from massive losses is completely bizarre, but I suppose welcome to trump's America now. I suppose the question we could ask is does that motorcycle company really needs to transfer part of its production over to Europe?

Speaker 5:          07:35          Harley Davidson need to look to the world.

Speaker 6:          07:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:39          American companies have enough challenges and problems to overcome as it is without us having to deal with interference and nonsense from the White House. You see, trump's trade war has had a strong impacts on companies like Harley Davidson. Their costs have increased due to steal and Alan minium tariffs since, but this means that the motorcycle company is spending 20 million more dollars every year, and if that wasn't enough, American multinationals are starting to see the risk of them. Market's closing.

Speaker 6:          08:05          Okay.

Speaker 5:          08:05          Creasing international production to alleviate the EU tariffs burden. He's not the company's preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make. It's motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe. Europe is a critical market for Harley Davidson statement by Harley Davidson

Speaker 1:          08:24          because of this crisis has hard to the motorcycle company at a time when it was already pretty weak. Checkout, for example, I'm its stock price has evolved over the last four years. Why did this happen? Why did they see a huge 40% drop in years when the US stock market has risen like a rocket? While the main explanation there via is that times are changing was a time when these big bikes, these huge, powerful, noisy beast sweat something of a dream for many Americans. However, due to the price, they are very expensive and changing tastes. Today's generations aren't as attracted to this type of motorcycle. In fact, the average age of holly earners in the United States today is over 50 and Zillow vis, as you can imagine, translates into the number of sales at the company I'm making. And therefore their profits in the last three years alone, the company's sales have decreased by 10% of profits of full length, almost 40% and in 2018 things are even worse.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Just a viewer is why this company, they need to look abroad both to Europe and Asia. Because if there is no commercial freedom and there are tariffs production, it just has to go to other places because no Harley Davidson's decisions got nothing to do with politics. And of course it's not a betrayal. It's simply an economic and understandably logical decision made by a company that simply has to compete. Something by the way, isn't easy now that they have to face the consequences of the commercial war that Washington has unleashed. You know what? This is not an isolated case. Listen to this

Speaker 6:          10:18          multinationals, drums,

Speaker 1:          10:22          lessees, hom, American companies, and by extension the American economy. And of course the further of the war goes, the greater the consequences will be.

Speaker 3:          10:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:33          The moments American multinationals, some of whipped supported trump park getting very, very nervous about this whole thing. General Motors itself has said that if the president finally approves tariffs on vehicle importations, it's something that the White House raised recently. The consequences would be less investment, that fewer jobs and fewer wages for General Motors workers in the United States. Take for example, the case of another us icon, the Ford Mustang, which of course is assembled in the United States and exported from there to the rest of it. Yeah. Well about 48% of the mustangs components come from outside of the United States, so if those import south punished with tariffs, the result is a more expensive car, both for American consumers as well as,

Speaker 3:          11:24          so we only have two

Speaker 1:          11:25          American Aniko Ford mustangs and Harley Davidson's being negatively affected by trump's policies. It's not a good thing,

Speaker 6:          11:32          right? America first America first,

Speaker 1:          11:38          and companies from other countries that have factories in the United States such as Toyota for your Chrysler, Daimler and BMW. A warning of the dangers of this war. Mercedes Benz parent company. Daimler warned that dueling tariffs between the United States and China will hit its earnings. Specifically for SUV is made in Alabama, but this isn't only effecting the automotive industry, it's virtually all sectors because yes, it's true that the United States is the largest economy on the planet has, but do not forget that 85% of its GDP in most of its growth happens outside its borders. Closing up, it's simply bad for business.

Speaker 1:          12:19          Knitting barriers goes precisely against the interests of a country that has currently got a lot of employment, is hitting record numbers in terms of workers and has the largest industrial production and its history. Yeah, I know Donald Trump talks a lot about the trade deficits and yes, there really is one, but that's not for the reason that the president's states, you see the United States, it doesn't have a trade deficit because it's being robust, not at all. In fact, it's simply got it because this is an economy that consumes more than it produces. If Donald Trump wants to reduce the deficits, he can't. For example, stop the immense public spending that is causing so many problems. As we saw in this previous video, you can also promote savings and investments, so the companies are more productive among many, many other things. And the overall reality is, is that this trade war is kind of bad for everyone, but now it's your turn. What do you think about the trade war? Do you support it d and not?
