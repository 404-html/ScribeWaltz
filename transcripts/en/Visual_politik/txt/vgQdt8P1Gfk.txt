Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          the alliance between the United States and the European countries is not exactly having its best moments right now. Donald Trump has made quite an inference and as jeopardize the relationship of these nations who an extent that they could even possibly break up. We have seen that with the Paris agreement, make our planet great the game and also with Donald Trump's position towards NATO, the most powerful military organization in history and I never asked watch what the new NATO headquarters cost. I refuse to do that. In this video we're going to focus on this organization. We're going to look at what's happening with Neato, why Donald Trump is criticizing. It's so much and what the future is for this organization, but before we get into any of that, let's get some perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:01          NATO,

Speaker 2:          01:02          I'll look back

Speaker 2:          01:06          shortly after the ends of World War Two, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it took its first steps. It was born in 1949 with a very clear mission, restrain, stop, and if needed, defeat the Soviet Union. The Cold War had just started and there was an atmosphere of tension. The Berlin blockade is already taking place in the Czech Communist Party, had completely taking control with acute attack. At that time, nobody knew what was going to happen. The Ans, the possibility of war was very, very real. So let's take a look at the historical context. The world had just gone through World War Two. Europe was destroyed and there was an absolute distrust on both sides. The truth is the door wouldn't have been a surprise and that was the situation which existed when NATO was born.

Speaker 1:          01:50          At the beginning,

Speaker 3:          01:51          NATO was formed by the United States, Canada, and 10 European countries, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and portrait. A few years later, the federal public of Germany or western Germany was added to that.

Speaker 2:          02:06          The general purpose of the idea, a bit spirits, so to speak, was to bring it forces together. If a man become, she was attacked. It was seen as if all the members had been attacked as well. Over 101 for all, right? Well, yes, but also not quite because there was quite and lots of small prints.

Speaker 3:          02:29          NATO after the colon.

Speaker 2:          02:33          However, that all changed in 1991 the fall of the Soviet Union left Neato with no clear Parvis without an enemy. What is the point of the alliance? That is a question many people asked and many still do today, but wait one second because against all odds, it was actually after the fall of the Soviet Union that the organization started to play a more active role.

Speaker 1:          02:59          It is

Speaker 3:          03:01          take an action quite frequently since then. It's includes Serbia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya, control over the Baltic Sea. It gets piracy and the Indian Ocean and recently support for the fight against Isis

Speaker 2:          03:13          was also during this time when more new countries that signed up since it started in corporations have been regular, but since 1991 in corporations have really sped up.

Speaker 1:          03:24          1949

Speaker 3:          03:25          there were 12 countries in NATO. Today there are 28 many of these countries are from the old Warsaw Pact, a similar thing to NATO, but led by the Soviets

Speaker 2:          03:38          hands. Putin's Russia has never liked that. In fact of the award of 2008 between Russia and Georgia took place, partly because Georgia wanted to become a member of NATO and something similar has happened in the Ukraine, ends after the recent crisis in Ukraine and the clash between them and Russia, NATO seems to have sped up again.

Speaker 1:          04:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:10          also in 2016 and immediate action force was set up. This is made of 5,000 soldiers capable of deploying very quickly and in almost any place. The socal audit spearhead force has 5,000 soldiers that are part of a larger rapid action force of 40,000 soldiers. In order to coordinate it's deployments via alliance has created since September, 2014 eight support headquarters in all the countries that used to be under Soviet influence. And then 2017 the United States made the largest troop deployments in Europe since the Cold War following a NATO mission.

Speaker 3:          04:49          Thousands of US troops arrive in Europe in one of the largest deployments since the cold

Speaker 2:          04:53          or we all talking about more than 4,000 soldiers and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles already being deployed in eastern Europe on a mission that reminds us of the initial mission of NATO to discourage Russia from any expansionist temptations. However, despite all of this activity, the role of NATO is still uncertain and the United States is still unhappy with the commitments from the organizations. European partners.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Yes.

Speaker 3:          05:23          The anger of the United States.

Speaker 2:          05:26          I was saying, oh, the Rom the mutual defense guarantee you if a member of NATO is a tax is not as clear as it seems. Take a look at article five the one that regulates this situation. Parties

Speaker 3:          05:38          agree that an armed attack against one or more of them shall be considered it an attack against them all. And consequently they agree that if such an attack occurs, each of them will assist the party or parties. So attacked by taking forth with such actions as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force article five of the North Atlantic Treaty,

Speaker 2:          05:58          including the use of armed forces. This means the Tipi country were to suffer an attack. It doesn't mean the rest have to give immediate military support and that is why all of the presidents of the United States, since Harry Truman have taken advantage of the first NATO meeting they attended to in article five as a commitment of military force.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:24          How are the Donald Trump hasn't, he was expected to do so during the inauguration of a monument for victims of nine 11 in Brussels where he attended his first meeting meeting. Indeed, he was asked to do so by the European countries. The White House have said that they would, but a final commitment was not forthcoming. There are analysts that think this is a major issue and they refer to this as one of the biggest diplomatic mistakes of all time. Other analysts don't think this is so important, but what is undeniable is that this has not been well received in Europe, especially for these reasons. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:56          okay.

Speaker 3:          06:57          Till now, the only country which is invoked article five was the United States. They did it after nine 11 and they received immediate support from all members of NATO.

Speaker 1:          07:06          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:06          Well thing is that trump didn't want to offer support and actually he took advantage of his speech. Do you recrimination the alleged lack of commitments by his European allies?

Speaker 1:          07:15          He

Speaker 3:          07:16          Europeans what? Dedicating a monument to remember the 888 European, 158 Canadian and 2,396 American troops who died in Afghanistan took some doing Thomas, right?

Speaker 1:          07:28          Let's,

Speaker 2:          07:28          trump is not the only one angry about it. Bama. He had the same opinion. And the question is now, why is the United States so angry at NATO? Well basically because they claim that the European members of NATO on not committed enough or don't spend enough

Speaker 1:          07:43          money

Speaker 3:          07:49          rule. All NATO members are committed to spending at least 2% of their GDP on defense. However, only a few countries and meeting this commitment, these include the United Kingdom, Poland, Sonia Greece, and of course the united,

Speaker 2:          08:03          the rest welfare, quite some way from spending that amounts. Just taking a look at what trump's secretary of defense, James Mattis has to say about the European countries.

Speaker 3:          08:12          Americans cannot care more for your children's future security than you do.

Speaker 2:          08:17          Now wait a second, because it does this mean that the European countries don't spend money on defense? Well, that's certainly not the case. In fact, if we add up all of the budgets of all European countries that are members of NATO, these countries spend $250 billion every year. So you're with these countries were one, it would be the country with the second highest military spending after only the United States. So if it's money we're talking about, it's not that spending has been reduced or at least not relative to the threats of the world is currently facing times. They're pretty different sands. We don't live with a Soviet Union anymore,

Speaker 1:          08:56          and obsession of the United States,

Speaker 2:          09:00          let us say it loud and clear. The world has changed and we are facing different difficulties than we were ever in the 1960s the risk today is not just the possibility of a great war. This risk has been reduced by globalization, trade and mutually assured destruction. The threats we face today can be found in terrorism, piracy, cyber warfare, am's, the risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. So must we fight these risks? Well, certainly this is something that we won't accomplish with more tanks. We also need to consider that we are dealing with a very different kind of water date, something known as hybrid warfare where combat isn't like what it was in older movies. Most of the wars are more and more often about gorillas and as groups aimed at destabilizing nations. Other that is political pressure, economic penalties, cyber warfare, interference. In the election processes, intelligence, operations, et Cetera, et Cetera, that make wall much more company.

Speaker 1:          09:59          Okay. To the mistakes of Europe,

Speaker 2:          10:06          one thing is clear, they see numbers on not doing everything right. On the one hand is the organization has established a more sensible conditions. 20% of the budget should be spent on equipment here. Even European countries, which spends more on soldiers than they need still arms meeting this requirements on the other hands. European countries, I'll still quite disorganized and use very different systems, which makes production maintenance and deployments more ends more expensive. Just have a look at what happens with tech.

Speaker 3:          10:37          The United States primarily uses one kind of tank, the Abrams tank, while the Europeans use it to 19 different models.

Speaker 2:          10:46          Imagine the chaos when he joined deployments. It has to be organized. They can't even share the same replacement equipments and as well the same is true for much more than just tanks. And so the final question is, can it may say play a significant role in the future? In our opinion here, a visual politic, yes, they absolutely can, but only after a bit of a perspective shift. We feel that countries can spend money better and actually share resources rather than just spending more, even though that might upset some military contractors. Well now we'd like to know your opinion. Now, what should the future of NATO beat? Do you think that the European countries that should meet to the U S is demands? Or do you think a NATO, you should focus less on conventional warfare? Or maybe you think, Nita, you should just dissolve. Let us know what you think in the comments below.
