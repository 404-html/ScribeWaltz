Speaker 1:          00:08          Two thousand and 17 is the year that Canada celebrates 150 years of existence. The specific day of their birth date was the first of July. So. Well happy belated birthday

Speaker 2:          00:26          Canada.

Speaker 1:          00:29          Well did you at 150 years of existence is not the only matter. We should be congratulating Canada on the country reached its One hundred and 50th anniversary in great shape because. Well if there's something we can say about Canada right now, it's the country certainly in low.

Speaker 2:          00:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50          And yes. Canada is also the homelands of many celebrities that we all know. Well, Mazda has been one celebrity who has been putting the international political spotlight. We're of course talking about Justin.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Oh No, no, no, no, no,

Speaker 1:          01:13          no, no, no. Not that. Justin. We met this one. Of course, Justin Trudeau. It has reached its 150th birthday as one of the richest countries in the world with a top notch quality of life as well as being one of the most admired countries on earth. Certainly not bad. Right? So now you might be wondering what is the cause of all of this? What are the main achievements that Canada is celebrating after 150 years, and importantly, why is there a dark side to Canada? We're going to answer all of these questions in this video, but first, let us get some perspective,

Speaker 3:          01:50          a great transformation,

Speaker 1:          01:53          not have had much about Canada recently, but we can certainly say that they all know ordinary country. In fact, Canada is the second biggest country in the wells with its territory covering it. Six different time zones and guess which country has the most coastline in the world? Well, no prizes, if you guessed Canada, of course as well. Regular visual politic view is already known either the size of the country, surface and or its coastline determines its wealth or how many opportunities it's citizens have. So then what's really behind the success on Canada? Well, one key factor here is the disastrous years the Canada had in the late eighties and early nineties,

Speaker 3:          02:34          Canada suffered economic stagnation and several crises. These were bad enough that in 1995, the Wall Street Journal called Canada, an honorary member of the third world due to its inability to control government accounts.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Things then as you can see, things have changed enormously. Canada really knew how to play to their strengths and get rid of their weaknesses and especially the above. All Canadians have really understood the importance and the meaning of these two words, competitiveness and integration. After those disastrous years of the eighties and nineties, Canadians realize that before thinking about spending, it is absolutely essential to think about creating and they realized that in order to do that, they needed investment businesses and trade a great deal of trade

Speaker 1:          03:31          well, so as it was said, so it was done in Canada is today these seven freest economy in the world, but if we're talking about freedom, then we can't just talk about the economic side of things. The Fraser Institute publishes every year, something called the Human Freedom Index. This measures both the economic and the civil freedoms that people enjoy. Quite simply, it measures what we can't do and what we can't so well according to their research. Canada is the freest country on earth. To give you a better idea of how this compares to some other countries. Well, the USA, they ranked 23rd. Isn't, isn't it 28th and Japan is flagging and position 32. Maybe the reason for this is these strong decentralization that the country has Canada instantly that into 10 provinces and three territories that have so many unique regulations that in 2017 they actually had to sign a free trade agreement among them.

Speaker 1:          04:25          You interprovincial trade deal expected to add billions to the economy. I think decentralization is absolutely enormous and it is traditionally resulted in higher costs for those companies that don't operate in a single region, but in several different regions with each region having different regulations. In Ontario, petrol must be at least five percent ethanol. Manitoba insists on an eight point five percent blend. The positive side of this is that this has worked as a counterweight to the federal governments and it's encouraged them to make pro citizen policies, and that's something that has driven good public policies anyway. This new agreement has been created in order to beat all these surprising obstacles further, as we talked about in a previous video. There's also the Canadian bets on multiculturalism and well, let us be relative frank here. Nowadays, this country is one of the best examples of integration in the entire world, but ah, the Canadian mosaic, but also this Canadian multiculturalism. And what's it all really about? Well, basically it consists of accepting that cultural diversity is not a threat, but it's an asset and a source of opportunities for a country. Now, of course, this multiculturalism is always subordinate to a core set of values such as democracy, such as the rule of law and equality for all people.

Speaker 2:          05:49          Yup. Nope.

Speaker 1:          05:49          This needs that in order to be Canadian and be welcomed into their country, you don't have to replace your culture with any other like the Canadian culture. You just have to accept and commit to those core Canadian values. I mean, Canada has one of the largest populations of immigrants in the world. One out of every five Canadians weren't born in Canada. I mean, for some cities like Toronto, this figure it grows up to 50 percent or even higher and it seems that it will be even higher in the future because every year more than 300,000 new immigrants come to this country, which is one of the highest immigration rates in the entire world. And you know, the result of all of this is, do you think is the problem? Well, it's. It's actually no problem at all. Yeah. Look, as we said in that previous video integration in Canada, it's certainly not for free. There's the system that exists that's based on three fundamental pillars, points, family reunification and refugees. The most important one of these is the points based system. This exists do grants people, residents or work permits. It considers things like having a job offer, which is the most important thing, or also maybe having a degree or having the ability to speak

Speaker 2:          06:58          English and

Speaker 1:          07:01          I know the results of these policies. Well, almost 80 percent of Canadians think that immigration is good for the economy. This is something that really shouldn't be so strange when you consider that all the statistics show that immigrants, the brands, new Canadians are more educated, they work more hours, they create more businesses as they draw less dollars from social programs. Now the question might be, does Canada have, does it have any rules about immigration? Certainly it does, but this sort of welcoming culture focused on integration. Well, it's pretty Rad.

Speaker 2:          07:36          Exactly.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Nineteen, 77. Every Canadian citizen can hold any other nationality without restriction, so when someone immigrates to Canada arounds after some years they can obtain the Canadian passport. They don't have to renounce their previous nationality, but if something might perfectly show Canada spirits, well that would be Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Speaker 3:          07:56          Hi everyone. I'm Justin Trudeau.

Speaker 2:          08:06          Yes.

Speaker 3:          08:08          Didn't Trudeau a political star?

Speaker 1:          08:12          Didn't he die? He took office in 2015 almost buying surprise and that just 44 years vein today. He is one of the most popular politicians in the world and that's true in Canada as well. This is something that the Poles

Speaker 3:          08:25          clearly show a recent survey by abacus data on the leadership of the prime minister shows that 70 percent of Canadians are confident that Trudeau will successfully manage Canada's relations with its allies. Sixty three percent trust his responsibility to make decisions, and 62 percent believed that his decisions will be good ones. I mean, how many politicians around the world would really like approval? Rating is like those. We need a leader. However, Trudeau, he's not a typical

Speaker 1:          08:56          politician, not at all. The Prime Minister of Canada has personal, a table, a program, and the form of government that's really quite different from what's typically being used and when you look at his cabinet, I mean it's a realistic sample of Canada's reality.

Speaker 2:          09:09          Hey, cabinet looks like Canada.

Speaker 3:          09:14          10 of the 30 ministers are women. There's even an Afghanistan veteran and an individual who is formerly a volunteer in Niger. There also business executives and even some ministers who are Sikhs, which is a religion native to the Punjab state in.

Speaker 2:          09:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:31          The latest addition to that, and they by the way, has been who sent a Somali, who arrived to Canada as a refugee at 16 years old and is now the minister of integration. Pretty amazing. Alright, today's political priorities. Well there is international as these cabinets. One of the government of Canada is key challenges is to boost trade among nations. Now pay attention to that foreign affairs,

Speaker 2:          09:52          right?

Speaker 3:          09:53          Trade barriers hurt the people. They are intended to help the curb growth, stifle innovation and kill employment. This is a lesson we should learn from history.

Speaker 1:          10:03          This is why Trudeau wants to sign a free trade agreements with China. Secondly, unlike other governments to do, doesn't just reject protectionism, but he wants to stimulate a productive change with artificial intelligence and automation. I mean why you can do technology if there's something we've seen as history has progressed, is that technology improves people's lives and to create some more jobs.

Speaker 1:          10:29          Not seeing something like that is too complicated to do, but the reality is that there are not many world leaders who defend this pro technology position talking about jobs going away. It's not exactly a popular line. The other great challenge and maybe the key value of Trudeau's government is that bets on boosting civil rights and sending Canada into an international example of how this should be done. Take a look at the power of this picture. Trudeau has become the first prime minister to lead an Lgbtq pride parade. There's also the most recently released program, Canada's feminist international assistance policy. Yep. You heard that right. Trudeau's government didn't hesitate to declare itself feminist and among other things, they have decided to do focus and most of their international cooperation budgets on pushing winans rights where they are most needed, no this, it's just a symbol, but sometimes symbols that pretty important. Other symbols and gestures are is positioned towards Syrian refugees and pay close attention to this speech.

Speaker 4:          11:25          In recent months, Canadians have opened their hearts and their arms to families fleeing the ongoing conflict in Syria and from the moment they arrived, those 31,000 refugees were welcomed not as burdens, but as neighbors and friends. As new Canadian

Speaker 2:          11:44          today state

Speaker 3:          11:45          40,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in Canada. Almost half of them, thanks to the sponsorship of Canadian citizens had committed to be responsible

Speaker 1:          11:54          and looking after their wellness. This is a great example of solidarity. I mean, it's one thing being kind and generous and. Well, it's quite another to be naive. Bus consider this. The Canadian government has announced its intention to increase military spending by more than 70 percent from now until 20, 24 in order to create a more agile and modern armed forces.

Speaker 2:          12:17          Yes.

Speaker 1:          12:22          Trains, doors open to technology integration, civil rights, security, all these things don't sound bad at all, right? Especially if you consider that this government understands that before starting to discuss spending, you have to talk about wealth creation. Well, I mean that's how Canada has reached its One hundred and 50th anniversary. Everything. Bloody Marvelous, right? Well, wait a second. I mean not exactly. Yeah, there are certainly some shadows, but we're actually gonna have to leave those for another video. Something we're probably going to call the dark side of Canada. Don't think that it's all just rainbows and butterflies in Canada. Certainly not. Not at all.
