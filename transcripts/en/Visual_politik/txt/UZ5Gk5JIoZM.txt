Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:06          we have to be clear. The world has never been better than it is right now. Thanks mostly to globalization. There are less and less wars. Global poverty is falling markedly and it's quality of life is generally improved, is obviously not happening in a uniform way across all countries. Burdened globally, everything is improving. Many western countries have decided to rebel and refuse openness as well as understanding among the nations in Europe, for example, far right parties are spreading uncertainty. This is Le Pen in France. There's violence is in the Netherlands as hoffer in Austria.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:44          These are all good examples of a new wave of politics that is also affecting countries like Finland, Denmark, Germany, and Hungary, among others. Further, it is also partly responsible for the brexit victory in the United States.

Speaker 2:          01:03          It is a movement that is taking advantage of fear despite the fact that we are living in societies that are becoming safer and safer. As you well know, these ideas are not something that is exclusive to Europe. Donald Trump won the US election and he has spoken about his views which are clearly contrary to globalization and immigration. At this point, the best question we can ask is, are there any developed countries left that still believe in open borders and the globalization? Well, the answer to that question is yes, there are, and then the video today we're going to be looking at one of the most significance of those countries. Cannabis openness. Yeah. Two Thousand and 16 alone. Canada admitted to its country more than 300,000 immigrants. It's close to one percent of Canada's total population. Further, this is a greater proportion than any other developed country and do note here that this is nothing new. This is something that's been going on for two decades, is a result of this, is that today, one in every five Canadians was born abroad. This is a percentage that is almost double that of the US and the UK.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:15          Took. The matter is, is that this hasn't led to any sort of national tragedy. In fact, quite the opposite, and Canadians well notice according to the prestigious and Veronica's institute's most citizens, almost 80 percent of them consider immigration. To be good for the economy and think that it is one of the best ways to deal with some of the issues facing Canada such as its aging.

Speaker 1:          02:44          If

Speaker 2:          02:44          you really think about it, it does make sense. Employment is the country's most productive assets, so why would they want to prevent it from growing in the context of a dynamic economy? What's the harm of immigrants who are willing to work? We're willing to set up companies and once you get an education, it is something that we have. Visual politic thing is actually pretty good.

Speaker 2:          03:06          First Year in 2015 just introduced became Canada's prime minister. He defeated against all odds. The conservative at Stephen Harper. Harper had held the office for almost 10 years. Since then, the political agenda has been dominated by a determination to deepen the country's pro globalization policies. Trudeau himself, a left winger, has been quite an advocate of promoting free trade and social mobility. In his first year, he signed a free trade agreement with the European Union and confirmed Canada's adherence to the TPP. Although trump's first action in office was to destroy the TPP, was going to be the biggest commercial agreements in history in just the year Canada has built up free trade agreements with nearly 60 percent of the global economy. Further Trudeau wants to expand this and increased trade with China. We've agreed to launch exploratory talks towards a potential free trade agreement between Canada and China. As the government is doing more of the same concerning immigration, they've even set the goal of increasing the number of immigrants they get 50 percent every single year for my refugee fleeing Somalia to becoming a member of parliament in Canada. I've met as once again a med history this week after it was named Canada's Minister of Immigration by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a major cabinet reshuffle. Given these principles, it probably shouldn't surprise you to learn that Canada is one of the countries that are most committed to receiving Syrian refugees. Canada has received more than 33,000 Syrian refugees since Trudeau took office in his first year. Trudeau himself went to Toronto's airport to welcome the refugees into the country

Speaker 2:          04:46          migration policy. Let's hold on a second because immigration to Canada isn't totally free, in fact, it's not as free as we're visual politic would like, but what's really important here is not whether or whether there are not excessive administrative difficulties, so rather than citizens shouldn't automatically view those who are immigrating into the country as criminals, and this is precisely why Canada is so successful, they are a country that takes pride in looking for additional citizens. They are not looking for temporary immigrants since 1967. Immigration to Canada has been based on a points system. This system considers qualifications, experience professional skills, and the knowledge of either French or English in the same way. The system also gives priority to those who are needed by Canada's companies. Canada will lift the Mexican visa requirement that has restricted travel to Canada. This move will make it easier for our Mexican friends to visit Canada wild growing our local economies and strengthening our communities. The tendency seems to be to make these procedures easier, but what is really important is the social recognition and the integration of immigrants into the country. The Canadian bill of rights itself recognizes the concept of multicultural patrimony. There are solid policies to encourage integration, which by the way, don't focus on stripping the immigrants of their original cultural identity, but rather see that as an enriching

Speaker 2:          06:14          snowball in Canadian schools. It is easy to find classes that are taught in Spanish or Ukrainian and the results support these policies. In deed in the last decade, Canada's growth has been bigger than the US, the UK, and Germany and its citizens in dry, a very high standard of living. Now. Hopefully it might be more clear as to why Canada's immigration website collapsed after trump's. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:34          victory.

Speaker 2:          06:38          I understand why the economists has also had cover pages highlighting Canada's no,

Speaker 1:          06:45          no.

Speaker 2:          06:46          Of course, the Canadian model is not perfect boss. Compared to the new nationalist and populist tendencies of other countries, Canada has shown what a desirable alternative openness can really be. The key takeaway that we hope this video really puts across is to try and make things better in your country rather than isolated from the rest of the world. The latter of which is an argument. There's many politicians like trump are defending, well, this isn't our opinion here at visual politic and now we would love to know yours.
