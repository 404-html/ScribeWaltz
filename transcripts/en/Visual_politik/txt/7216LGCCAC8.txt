Speaker 1:          00:07          The conflicts between Israel and Palestine is one of them is complicated in international politics and as you all probably know, it's one of the most controversial political situations in the entire world. In order to make it easier in this video, we're going to tackle the very delicate issue of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and this is a pretty major issue because almost all countries find these settlements to be a serious violation of international law in the last 40 years. All of the administrations in the United States have taken a position against them, and when I say them, I do mean all of them and yes, this matter has compromised the special relationship that exists between the US and Israel. And I'm not talking about governments like Jimmy Carter's yet, not at all. Indeed, Ronald Reagan himself demanded the immediate freeze of any new settlements as he claims they were an evident obstacles piece.

Speaker 1:          00:51          George Hw Bush threatens to take disciplinary measures of an economic nature, and then Bill Clinton proposed a law to punish Israel by reducing American assistance. Even today at trump's administration has asked Israel to stop being such a pain in the ass about it. Since taking office in January, trump has publicly asked Netanyahu to constrain suddenly construction, but has not condemned. The State Department has said that it is not helpful to the peace process. So what do you think Israel has done in the face of all this criticism? Well, they have basically ignored it and have kept expanding their settlements, but okay, now we are here. You might be wondering what are these settlements and what do they really mean? Well, let's have a look at that. Settlers and settlement.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Last thing we need to know is that according to agreements that have been reached, the territory, your state of Palestine is formed by what is today known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. These territories corresponds to the political map prior to the six day war, after which Israel occupied these territories which used to belong to Jordan. So the settlements, they are essentially communities, villages, towns and cities that Israel has been building since 1970. In the West Bank territory. You have the future Palestinian state and it is not just a few houses we're talking about here. The West Bank is a small territory at belly 5,600 square kilometers, which is about the size of the state of Delaware, but even so, and this is not considering east theresa limp plant, a 131 settlements and furthermore there are an additional 97 out posts. These are posts, they are settlements as well if it in these cases, these settlements are illegal even under Israeli law. These are posts they were built without the consent of the Israeli government. That means that there are more than 228 Israeli settlements around the West Bank. Many are in places of relevant value like aquifers and that makes it more complicated because roads and infrastructure need to be set up in order to connect to them. Besides Israel needs to protect these settlements and that involves police patrolling around the West Bank, which affects the mobility of Palestinians and makes economic development even more difficult,

Speaker 2:          02:56          and the

Speaker 1:          02:56          problem isn't just the existence of these is that they don't stop growing in the last year, more than 2000 new buildings have started to be constructed and there are plans to build $3,000 more in the next year alone. Obviously in addition to this, there are also medical centers, schools, synagogues, etc. So once the result of all of this, well take a look at this chart to see how the population has evolved.

Speaker 1:          03:23          So now you might be asking, well, what's the problem here? Those who are pro settlements claim these population centers are growing where they used to be nothing. Consider what the mayor of marley, I remember sounds about one of the main settlements. We didn't steal the land from anybody. It was built on empty hills. You can see there the desert rocks and sand. Now you have a living city. Then in cash rail mayor of ma'ale, adumim, ma'ale. Adam is a city of 40,000 inhabitants with schools, kindergartens, a theater, a library, and industrial center according to the residents that it's a complete city. All right. Again, so what exactly is the problem? the problem is that in order to solve the Israel palestine conflict, all parties agree the two states and necessary one being Israel and to being palestine, but with all the sediments, palestinian sovereignty in the west bank will be in serious danger because Israel has already said they will never give up sovereignty over these places, and that includes the roads, the infrastructure, the security controls. Let's be clear, palestine will be unable to become an effective and autonomous state with such limitations, especially considering these settlements. Waves stopped growing. Settlements are illegal under international law. At present, one of the main impediments to peace nicola and letting of united nations envoy on middle east peace. So now you can probably understand why this topic makes everyone so 10 years

Speaker 1:          04:41          more and more

Speaker 2:          04:42          sure.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Ins and yahoo's settlement policy. It hasn't stopped growing since 2015. The situation has reached a point and it's on the 23rd of December, 2016. The un security council passed a resolution 2134 that strongly condemns the israeli settlement policy. Security council reaffirms that the establishment by Israel of settlements in the palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including east jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of a two state solution and just lasting and comprehensive peace resolution to three, three slash four of the security council resolution could be passed because for the first time the us didn't use their rights to veto the resolution as well. This is something that made netanyahu's governments really furious. The prime miniSter didn't hesitate in describing the situation is absurd. Even accused barack obama's administration in public. I've tried to carry out a shameful anti israeli maneuver, so yeah, he was pretty angry, but this resolution shouldn't have taken you by surprise given some of the decisions he announced in 2016 and confirmed in 2017

Speaker 1:          05:51          ready governments has started a new settlements in the west bank, which is the first for two decades, so Israel not only has decided to encourage the existing settlements, but they've even started a new one on the other hands, maybe a powered by the alleged good relations with trump. The parliaments in Israel after lots of controversy. It finally passed a new law in the beginning of 2017. This lot legalized is around 4,000 houses built on palestinian private property houses that the israeli supreme court had even ordered to be dismantled. Rules of the game have changed with donald trump's arrival as president. We no longer have our hands tied as we did in the time of barack obama. Now we could finally build and take that. As we said before, the fact that trump might look closer to Israel doesn't mean that his administration isn't also tired. Of this settlement issue, that is why I'm in order to regain trump's favorite jerusalem is committed to starting a new policy that seems to slow down the growth of existing settlements and forbid outposts. It's completely, but the new policy, it's so cryptic and complicated that it seems very likely. These settlements, they'll just keep growing and now you probably have another question which is why do these settlements are they grow so much? Well, pay close attention here,

Speaker 1:          07:00          inexplicably policy thinking about it. Why do so many israelis want to live in these conflict zones? Is it because maybe there are some valuable natural resources to be exploited as well? NoT really the explanation. It's much less creative. The government of Israel is subsidizing the establishment of these settlements. That's right. The government in Israel, [inaudible] finances, the construction of houses, creating discounts of almost 70 percent for the price of land and offers a great deal of financial aid and you know the results as well. Houses are 40 percent cheaper than in the formal territory of Israel and say, well, that's not all the governments of Israel. Also interested is to get our take and provides all kinds of public services, so as you can imagine, the youth ends. Many families see these as places where they can have a better life than they could in israel's formal territory.

Speaker 1:          07:48          So now the question becomes, well, how does Israel itself benefit from this? Well, the truth is they really don't. So an exchange, they get just a bunch of political and economic problems. These settlements aren't just an obstacle for the peace process and foreign policy because they are also a big waste of public money. So look with the subsidies, the security, the expensive public services for these now foundation and the advert center. Both israeli by the way, estimate that the cost of these is more than a billion dollars a year. In other words, this is nothing that's an expensive policy both for the citizens of palestine as well as those of Israel. To get fooled,

Speaker 1:          08:30          let me be absolutely clear. Israel is a country full of positive things like that. Neighboring countries. Israel is a consolidated democracy with strong civil liberties and a prosperous and innovative economy. Many of the products and services we use everyday wouldn't exist if it weren't for the technology developed in Israel and don't be false. Putting an end to these settlements wouldn't mean and ends of the conflicts because there is a precedence in 2005. Israel left the gaza strip, completely stopping all the settlements and removing all civilians and soldiers and the result was neither piece nor prosperity. The strip is now Controlled by hamas radicals and it is even in conflict with the government to palestine itself and the situation isn't good from a humanitarian perspective, but it definitely doesn't justify the settlement policy of Israel and their lack of commitment towards the peace agreements. And so now the question is, is there really any possible solution to this conflict?

Speaker 1:          09:19          Well, more and more experts claim the solution needs to be a bottom up strategy. That is to say encourage economic development in the west bank. Establish a dialogue and understanding where trade relations between israelis and palestinians and normal answer lets the national authorities in palestine have more jurisdiction. These, they will require time, but more than that they require commitments. I said, no, it's your turn. What do you think should happen with the settlements?
