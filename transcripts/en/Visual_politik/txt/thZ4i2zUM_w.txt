Speaker 1:          00:00          Today. Let's just jump into the first question. Do you know how many tourists there were in 2017 all around the world? Well, listen, now, because this number may make more than one of you jumped out of your chair. According to data from the World Tourism Organization, no less than 1.3 billion people traveled from 2017 yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22          that's more than 1.3 billion international tourists. As you can imagine, this gigantic industry generated more than one point $2 trillion. I want to, we fines when there's so much business. Well, of course we find companies, well in this video we're going to focus on one company, one that was founded in 2008 have two young guys who couldn't even pay their rents and switch in just 10 years became one of the five largest tourist corporations in the world. I'm sure you all know it and I'm sure many of you have actually used us because of course we're talking about Airbnb, the largest accommodation company on the planet did by Simon's loved by others. So what's the Eir? It's true dimensions whilst purpose is it trying to achieve and what implications does this have? Well, let's dive in, shall we?

Speaker 2:          01:21          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Everything that has to do with Airbnb is pretty impressive and no, I'm really not exaggerating.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Only being 10 years old, Abbey and the has managed to become the largest Chrism accommodation company in the world. In fact, it sells more rooms than the next four companies in the ranking combined, Marriott, Hilton and intercontinental and wisdom, these are the four largest hotel chains in the wells combined. They have 3.3 million rooms. Airbnb alone, there's more than 4 million. We're actually talking about almost 5 million rooms spread over more than 190 countries. Through this platform. We can book a room in more than 81,000 different cities. These data, you can imagine the huge panic that heavy and B has caused in the boards of directors of the largest hotel companies.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Sure.

Speaker 1:          02:21          BNB is a mortal threat to the US hotel industry. Ian Schrager, American entrepreneur hotelier and real estate developer, and you know, the reality is while we have every reason to panic since it was launched, Airbnb as managed 300 million reservations, but if that sounds like a lot, well, keep listening because the numbers are growing so fast is that the company expects to surpass 1 billion reservations as of 2028 a year.

Speaker 2:          02:57          Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:58          Before we continue, there is

Speaker 2:          03:00          one note here. As you may know, most technology companies lose money, sometimes a lot of money in the first years. This is because they have to spend a lot to start up the company, acquire technology, build a brand, get customers, et cetera. That's of course someone has to make that investment because while at the end of the day, given minds that many times the founders of these companies are students, engineers, designers, etc. Generally young people who are not exactly billion as, that's why in silicon valley it's practically throughout the entire technological worlds. There's an instrument that has become something like the holy grail of the industry. That's the financing round. Hello.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Let me to explain how this works. A startup when it's not listed on the stock market, meets with a bunch of venture capital investors and presents their projects and then the investor or investors who put money on the table or services such as contacts and legal or technological support, they are given a part of the company and when the startup needs more resources, they have more financing rounds just like this.

Speaker 2:          04:01          Yes.

Speaker 1:          04:04          And its latest financing round. AIRBNB got $1 billion for about 3% of its shares. That means the investors valued the entire company at $31 billion. Not Bad for something that's 10 years old.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Right.

Speaker 1:          04:24          You said that you might now be wondering how enough did a company founded by two young graduates managed to become such a huge empire in such little time? Well, we're going to take a look at this and where and how it all began. And I'll tell you now that if the current numbers are impressive, that origins are not far behind. So listen up

Speaker 2:          04:48          the roots.

Speaker 1:          04:52          I imagine it's the year 2007 and your 26 years old, you've just finished your studies and you've moved to seek your fortune in the Capitol of technological entrepreneurship, San Francisco. But of course you've got to pay a lot's to live in such a fashionable city, so you get an apartment for $1,200 a month, which you can still barely a force. The question is, well, what would you do now?

Speaker 2:          05:17          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:18          well that's precisely the question that Brian Chesky and Joe Gibeah to have. Airbnb is three parents to answer. When an opportunity presented itself, there was a conference in the city, a designer's congress, and the hotels were full. So if these two guys had an idea, they said, why don't we buy a couple of their mattresses but them in the living room and rent them out? Well, ask precisely what they did. They offered a mattress to sleep on and breakfast in the morning in exchange for some money, which they would use to pay their rent to find customers. They set up a website app at and breakfast dotcom where customers could book a mattress in their living room. They got three customers and made $80 on the first night of the conference. Funny. But we didn't think air bed and breakfast would be a big idea.

Speaker 3:          05:58          You thought it might be able to pay the rent until we could think of the big idea. One thing I learned is big ideas sound stupid in the beginning, Brian Chesky, the founder and CEO of Airbnb,

Speaker 1:          06:08          well little by little they notice that the idea, it wasn't say far fetched in February of 2008 Nathan Bashas can architect by profession and joins the project as the third co founder and do with that Airbnb was well on its way.

Speaker 4:          06:24          Oh cool.

Speaker 1:          06:26          It was not going to be easy. The concept was nearly an embryo and idea that many investors thought who is completely crazy. Think about it. I mean it's a service to rent out a bed, an air mattress or even a sofa in a stranger's house. I mean it's a pretty bizarre idea. So we were, all they had was their credit cards and their own ingenuity.

Speaker 5:          06:44          Even said the other day that you would not meet a potentially with the prime minister of Spain, I'm not going to shut the White House visitors scheduled before. I'm pressure the United States. I don't even have a seal yet. You hear one thing and speeches and then you see a campaign that has the worst kind of tactics. Shame on you, Barack Obama. You can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska.

Speaker 1:          07:11          This first, a bit of luck came in the summer of 2008 it was the election year and the Democratic Party and Republican Party primaries coming to an end. As you know, they ended with a great convention where each party appoints the candidates. In this case, the nominees when Barack Obama and John Mccain,

Speaker 2:          07:27          wow,

Speaker 1:          07:27          do you advertise and raise funds? They released a breakfast cereal with the pictures of the candidates in the market. The best part is they caught the attention of venture capital company. There's only a few months later, gave them $20,000

Speaker 1:          07:41          from that [inaudible]. That growth was unstoppable, and today, a decade later, these two guys who couldn't afford their rents have more than $3 billion each and a pen and the ranking of the world's richest people. Indeed. It's a pretty amazing example of the American dream coming true. The fact is that throughout this process, technology played a big role, but so did the philosophy of the project itself. See, as I'm sure you all know, airbnb, it doesn't own apartments. It doesn't own hotels. It's simply an intermediary in a very synthetic way. The idea of the company is something like this.

Speaker 2:          08:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:15          In the wells that are many unused resources such as empty rooms and empty apartments. So if instead of investing in new resources, we give the owners of those unused resources the opportunity to make or improve their income, we can invest the money that we have in tech

Speaker 2:          08:30          Jay,

Speaker 1:          08:33          and now airbnb is going a step further. It wants to do the same with people's ingenuity. They've decided to launch an experience service. Allow me to explain how about some performance and activity. You like bike riding, visiting monuments, wine tasting, whatever has airbnb offers this experience to its customers. What are their best known experiences is the one you're seeing here? It's an adventure in which you can get to know the world of wolves. It's creator has already raised more than $300,000.

Speaker 2:          09:11          The truth

Speaker 1:          09:12          is that if you think about it, connecting and exploiting under utilized assets and people services and creativity isn't only a great idea. It also implies taking advantage of resources in a very efficient way while generating lots of benefits for society that, hold on a second because you're probably thinking right now, benefits society, airbnb rarely Simon, I mean the shore, our road. Lots of politicians out there who are saying that we need to pass the cute or at least limit these types of companies, but the reality is yes, there are benefits and I'm going to tell you about them.

Speaker 2:          09:47          The benefits,

Speaker 1:          09:51          why the bad publicity that has been having lately and D has brought a lot of benefits to society as a whole. The one, it's making travel more affordable for everyone. For example, in the u s the average rooms offered by this platform are between 35% and 47% cheaper than the average rooms offered by hotels in the same city. They have a much wider offer. You can find almost anything that suits your preferences on Airbnb, even if, I don't know if you wanted perhaps a tree house.

Speaker 2:          10:23          Okay,

Speaker 1:          10:24          sneak. This is a pretty inexhaustible source of wealth, more tourism, more services, more jobs. In fact, this platform is user spends on average twice as much as other tourists.

Speaker 2:          10:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:35          Perhaps and Andy's greatest overall benefit has been that it's allowed hundreds of thousands of people, usually middle class people to become real entrepreneurs in the tourism sector, thanks to Airbnb. Many families that had free rooms or an apartment or bought an old one to restore it and exploited now have a new source of income since it was launched to the posts. The owners who runs their rooms and their houses cover received more than $41 billion. And the data, it's very clear about this. Most of the beneficiaries and middle class families and yes, don't worry. I know that not everything is quite so rosy. AIRBNB has also generated some problems. For example, in the busiest cities, average rent has increased and some neighborhoods have become very busy to the displeasure of the kneaders.

Speaker 2:          11:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:36          I mean, aren't city's supposed to be dynamic? Is it bad for city to come alive and create jobs and create wealth? Isn't the real problem in how expensive houses often driven by politics as we saw in this video? Well, we're going to talk about that in a future video as well because this is certainly a lot to say about it, but for now it's your turn. What do you think should be done with airbnb?
