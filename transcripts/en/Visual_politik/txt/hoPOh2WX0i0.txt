Speaker 1:          00:08          We wanted flying cars instead of, we got 140 characters with these words. Peter Thiel, the famous Silicon Valley investor who we've talked about before, joins the legions of people. You consider that innovation in the past few years has slowed down somewhat, although most of the time of great revolutionary inventions seems to have been left behind.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Who else could have done it? Start Trek, Christy. So competent. Okay. Things on that. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:42          Example, if this slowdown can be found in the automobile industry, an industry that has been pretty static for decades, yes, cars nowadays are better than 10 to 20 years ago, that's for sure, but they are basically the same and they launch any work in the same way. In fact, there is nothing substantial that you can do with a car today that you couldn't do 20 or 30 years ago, and of course cars still don't fly. Maybe we present the top 95 you on, you being, Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:20          Sierra Alpha. Bravo.

Speaker 1:          01:29          I'm Wendy was talking about a simple industry here, but one of the biggest industries in the world. However, I do, hold on a second here because everything suggests that finally, we are on the verge of a great revolution in the realm of cars or trans formation that many experts have compared to the one in the early 20th century that was engineered by Henry Ford where he began to use assembly lines to mass produce cars.

Speaker 2:          01:57          Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Make this new revolution seems to have two key features, the electric car and the autonomous car. And here we have an unquestionable star, a company that isn't managed to start changing things and knows how to win the admiration of the many people who see us as an example of a new era that is about to begin. We are of course talking about Tesla. The company have electric cars that has managed to dazzle investors as well as governments. And that in this video we are going to see you what kind of challenges Tesla is going to face in the coming years. So let's dive in. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:37          History of wine and roses.

Speaker 2:          02:41          That's

Speaker 1:          02:42          what is a very young company. It was born in 2003 with the mission of producing an electric car capable of competing and defeating combustion engines. Since then, it has managed to basically put on the market for models, the Tesla roadster, the model s, the model x hands, the newcomer, the model three seems to be around the few rights. Well, despite this, in 2010 the company went public and you know what happens? Well, Tesla, it's become one of the markets stars in these years. The price of their shares has multiplied by 18 yes. Just like that. In 2010 if you had invested $1,000 in Teslas shares today, you would have $18,000 a pretty amazing investments. All this growth has led tesla to fight for first place among the most valuable companies in the United States.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Time of publishing this video, if you want to buy us well, prepare your wallet because Tesla is worth more than $50 billion. This is more than the value of forward, by the way, Amazon not that far off. General Motors. Just have a look at this chart from business insight. Yeah. You think not bad. Right. This is especially the case. If we take into account that it is a company that is barely 14 years old and there's, well, honestly doesn't sell that many cars.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Generally

Speaker 1:          04:08          it sells 10 million cars each year and Ford exceeds 6 million, but in 2016 Tesla managed to sell just 76,000 cars.

Speaker 2:          04:19          All right.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Okay. Many of you are probably thinking right now, well, come on Tesla. They already sell luxury cars and yes, that is true, but it's still just 76,000 cars, which is three times less than Paul is. What explains why General Motors sales in 2016 we're almost $170 billion while tesla remains well below to just 10 billion. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:45          Dollars.

Speaker 1:          04:49          Do you know think that what is happening is Tesla has very high margins and is earning a lot of money. Not at all. In fact, in fact, since the company was founded, it is not ends money in any single. Yeah. Sorry. This point you're probably wondering, well, why then is it worth so much money on the stock market? Why has it been so successful there and why indeed is this company so famous?

Speaker 2:          05:11          Wow.

Speaker 1:          05:12          We all answer to that is that the company has a lot to do with a revolution that's happening in the industry that we commented on before hand. That's the introduction of electric and autonomous vehicles.

Speaker 2:          05:28          Perfect. For example,

Speaker 1:          05:29          in 2016 there were more than 2 million electric cars on the road. 60% is more than in the previous. Yeah. That is to say, we are talking about markets that are growing incredibly quickly. Further technological advances have cut the price of this type of car. The forecast by Bloomberg new energy finance said that electric cars would become cheaper than conventional cars without government subsidies between 2025 and 2030 and is on the other hand, in as many countries, including China itself on betting on this technology as a way to reduce air pollution in cities tend to also as a way to reduce their dependence on foreign oil. It's not often that environment and national security. It comes together in such a combination, but here we are. Does that today. Tesla is the great reference points in this new industry. Many investors understand this and therefore value the future of the company highly. The company's own forecasts falling at the same line and expects that production will increase from 100,000 cars in 2017 to 500,000 in 2020 and more than a million by 2022

Speaker 2:          06:36          two

Speaker 1:          06:38          no, he seems like we're talking about the apple of the automotive sector. Right? Well, just wait a minute because not everything that surrounds Tesla is quite so great.

Speaker 2:          06:53          Eight

Speaker 1:          06:54          rusher of money, Tesla, they have a problem, a very serious problem indeed. Kassala in machine for burning money. Yes, you heard me correctly today, the business is not profitable than the company loses money every day, but not only that, it also has to make a lot of investments in order to compete. For example, its factories need pumping with loads and loads of money. We look at the money that comes in and out of the cash box at Tesla as we already did with Amazon. We can say that from 2010 when it went public, the company has it swallowed absolutely everything that is ends. It is the money from the car sales as well is about $10 billion more.

Speaker 2:          07:36          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:37          and the truth is that 2017 is not exactly Tesla's best year. In the first nine months of 2017 it's swallowed about 4 billion. Yes, really $4 billion in nine months and not only that, but at the same time it's non financial debt. For example, suppliers that have not been paid has absolutely skyrocketed. For this reason, lights are beginning to flash red at the company. Consider this graph. Yup. In the last few months, Tesla has lost $60 million every single day. Money of course, but it's had to cover with debt, but it doesn't stop that audits all testing or is also having many problems with its latest model constantly reveals. It just made 260 model three cars due to production bottlenecks. It also has quality problems and has dismissed stuff, which by the way is a little bit weird when they seem to need to be making a lot more cars rather than less. So do you want to see the car

Speaker 2:          08:40          [inaudible] and

Speaker 1:          08:49          so now you might be thinking, well surely there's got to be the worst of it. Right? Well just wait a minute because the worst of it is that the competition is moving really, really quickly.

Speaker 2:          09:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Thousand and 16 the [inaudible] and group sold more electric cars than Tesla and pretty much all big companies are already working on electric vehicles and autonomous cars. I business by the way, which companies such as apple, Google and uber are also getting into. And that's some pretty serious competition. So yeah, Tesla is not, the only player at this

Speaker 2:          09:22          game

Speaker 1:          09:31          is that almost all of its rivals is actually earned money and their research budgets at least as big as those at Tesla

Speaker 2:          09:38          dining

Speaker 3:          09:38          lyric. Steel's Tesla's thunder with heavy duty electric truck.

Speaker 1:          09:43          So at this point you might be thinking about what happens with Nokia and blackberry when apple stood out from all the major companies with the iphone. So now I ask you, do you think we could compare Tesla with apple? Well, I do not believe that the answer is easy, but I do believe there are at least a couple of differences that we do have to take into account. First. Apple was always worried about earning money with the iphone and seconds that product with something really, really disruptive. So much so there's even the competition predicted its failure. What Steve Ballmer, the then CEO of Microsoft said $500

Speaker 3:          10:20          I said, that is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard, which makes it not a very good email machine. Right now we're selling millions and millions and millions of phones a year. Apple is selling zero phones. A year is six months. Let's see how the competition goes. Steve Vollmer, former CEO of Microsoft

Speaker 1:          10:44          $500 I like our strategy. I like it a lot. As we have seen tesla does not have money or have any particularly surprising features. However, it has to be said. Is this, making your company on money has not been the most motivating element for its CEO. The well noon, Elon Musk

Speaker 3:          11:06          mosque, the vision,

Speaker 2:          11:07          yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:09          sorry. A genius ahead of his time. These are many opinions about Elon Musk and entrepreneur who has become a billionaire from his venture. Honest, these are businesses that have never worried about money with the exception of paypal, Tesla, I bloop, space x, anything which Elon Musk is involved with sounds like science fiction and seems to have an infinite budget. If something is clear, it is that with his ideas. Elon musk is influencing us in how we see and to build our future.

Speaker 2:          11:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:44          This does not mean that the future is already written.

Speaker 3:          11:47          Tesla has done very useful work by opening the market for electric cars and showing that people

Speaker 4:          11:54          may like them. Another issue is whether it can earn a lot of money when it reaches its final goal. I won't bet on Tesla. As an investor, I think it will be very difficult to survive. Andres [inaudible] fund manager, analyst coboss a m

Speaker 2:          12:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:13          the opportunity. Yeah. Does everything we've seen, I mean the Tesla is a company doomed to failure? No, of course not. Saying such a thing. It's certainly not our intention and among other things, because the future is blank definition on set and as big as Tesla also has many competitive advantages. For example, today it has an obvious technological advantage. It is a leader in the development and the manufacturing of batteries, which are the key to any electric car and very important for growth rate. Yeah. Then there is also China, China, China, China, China, China. Do you know who the biggest market for electric causes? Well, you might have guessed it from that last comment. It is indeed China in this country. More electric cars are sold each year. Then on the rest of the planet combines and it's government has clearly opted for this technology.

Speaker 2:          13:12          Well,

Speaker 1:          13:16          Tesla is now negotiating the installation of a big factory in Shanghai with rather preferential conditions and you know was it seems that negotiations with the Chinese governments are going in the right direction anyway, I knew the future. Well let us know what happens, but what is clear is that Tesla has been a turning points for the automotive industry, but that is also a fun facing many risks. The last one for example, comes from Washington. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          13:41          he

Speaker 1:          13:41          is that the fiscal reform of the Republican Party is going to finish public aid for the purchase of electric cars. Well, we will see how that matter runs, but when Hong Kong did something like that, tesla sales fell markedly. Anyway, now it's your turn.
