Speaker 1:          00:00          Imagine this situation, you live in London and you want to buy a house in San Francisco, the house costs one point $3 million. It's what comes in first, your payments or the handover of the keys. If you happen to pay first, you might fall into a scam. Maybe the house doesn't really exist or it's not owned by the person that you contact us. Don't forget that you can live a really long way away from that. You never met the person who's selling the house and believe me, you're not the first person or the last is going to lose money through an online scam like this. Ridiculous as it sounds, this is actually one of the most complicated problems that exists in economics and that's trust. But I know what you're thinking. You click this video expecting something about blockchain, about cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. What does all of this I have to deal with that. Well, I'll tell you,

Speaker 2:          00:51          yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Nowadays we've all heard of bitcoin and I'm sure many of you know of some other cryptocurrencies as well, like a theory. I'm light coin or riddle if you've dug deeper into this matter and you might also have heard about another term and that's blockchain for many. This crypto currency world is the ultimate revolution that's going to end governments and banks. For others it's just another financial bubble. This will make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their money from the police. Unfortunately the reality is way more boring than this bitcoin exchange reaches deal with Barclays for UK transactions but all is on just a second. If you felt cryptic currencies, but just a strategy to avoid taxes. I've got some news for you.

Speaker 2:          01:47          This municipality

Speaker 1:          01:48          of [inaudible] is going to let residents pay their taxes in bitcoin. It's mayor has announced, sorry, let's start from the beginning. Shall We? Blockchain? Blockchain is a technology. It just like virtual reality or peer to peer file sharing is a technology. As with every technology you can use it for any different things and one of them is cryptocurrencies and one of these cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and as with many technologies you can use it for many different things. One of them is cryptocurrencies and one of those cryptocurrencies is bitcoin. But it's not the only one. Many people think that these new coins will substitute legal money that is dollars, euros, or any other currency, but it doesn't have to be that way. In fact, cryptocurrencies can do many other things and today we're going to have a look at some of them. But now the real question is what is blockchain all about? What is it used for? And most importantly why, uh, banks starting to use it. Do they were going to answer all of these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at their history. What is blockchain used for? Look, bitcoin was born in 2009 nonetheless, the technology that it's based on, the blockchain was all the way back in 1991 so let's see how it works without even mentioning the word. Yep.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Ahead.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Body. We want to do this well because it's important to understand the blockchain can be used for many other things. And since this is a complicated matter, I asked one sec, one of the hosts of the Spanish visual politic channel to show it to you by drawing, which is something he can do and I sadly cannot.

Speaker 1:          03:26          All right, so let me take you back to the example of the house in San Francisco. The one that costs one point $3 million. In order to buy it, you have to sign a contract with the owner, but how do you know that he or she is going to meet that agreement? How do you know that the house exists if you've never seen it? In reality, usually we have a trusted third party, like a notary verifiers. This notary will verify the house exists. Since that you're talking to the real owner who is willing to hand over the keys when he gets the money. This is the way that any traditional contract works and it has many problems. First having many parties means that there's lots of waiting time and lots of fees, but there's an even worse problem here if someone hacked the computer of one of those third parties so you could modify the terms of the contract. This means traditional contracts on not as safe as they seem, and this is where the lock chain enters the picture. In this case, instead of using a traditional contract, we could use a so called smart contract.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Is that a little bit of software that executes automatically when something happens? In this case, you could leave your one point $3 million in a special account. So there's the moment when you open up a new door of your house as sensible, notice your presence and boom, the smart contract will take your 1.3 million bucks from that special accounts and send it to the seller in case the key doesn't work because you've been tricked, then the contract would not execute. All right, so all of this sounds pretty great, but who is going to validate any of this? Well, in this case, we don't actually need that parties or middlemen. There's may need for notaries whatsoever. In this case, we have a network.

Speaker 1:          05:14          This is a crappy is a company that offers a real estate sales internationally through blockchain. Well, in this case, all the sellers and buyers inside of this platform would be nodes of the network. And so now you might be wondering, so I just want to address it really quickly. No company has paid us to do this video. We just used the example of this company. So we can give a real life example. It makes it more tangible and hopefully more enjoyable. So while the great innovation of blockchain is that it's users will always have a copy of the contract. So all of them can be a point of verification. And in case one copy does not match the copy of another node system, we'll consider this to be fought. But yeah, but not only that, this contract will always be stored and what we call a block.

Speaker 2:          05:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:59          And this book at the same time will be stored in a chain of blocks. This is why we call this system blockchain. So if a hacker wants to modify our contract, he would have to get into all of the computers from the members of our blockchain all at the same time. As you can imagine, this is way harder than getting into one computer and no matter how secure that computer is, and now you might be wondering, so anytime I start using some blockchain service, will they have all the registers and transactions that have been done in Sinus? And the answer is, well, yeah. In fact, if you want to have a bitcoin, you should download all of the blockchain, which is now over 160 gigabytes

Speaker 1:          06:43          and now I can get many of you saying, well come on sign. And that's not true. I've got a bit coin while there's a nice enough to download 160 gigabytes or stuff. Well actually of course you do. In your case for you or what you have is actually a light coin. This means that another person downloaded those 160 gigabytes and now that person is letting you use bitcoin through his or has server. This said, blockchain is starting to be used for all kinds of things as you have already seen. Some companies offer real estate deals with smart contracts, but there are many, many other applications. You can even have a website hosting with blockchain so then he can hear it. US inside of a network would have the data, other companies offer medical record storage, et Cetera, et Cetera, but okay, we've already told you what blockchain is all about. Now there is a second part and that is, well what do banks have to do with all of this and that's something we're going to look at, right?

Speaker 2:          07:39          Survival

Speaker 1:          07:40          of the fittest. If there is one thing that generates all kinds of gossip and mixed signals and conspiracy theories, it's crypto currencies. You just need to google the name of any famous company followed by the word crypto currency and you've got some blogs that claims that this farm wants to get its own crypto coin or the opposite or both things. At the same time, there's information. Noise is so pervasive that it is almost impossible to separate the wheat from the chaff and this is also a heads up for you guys. He might want to start investing in this industry. Watch out. I'm not telling you, not to you, but be careful because there is a lot of hype and this is why to do this video. We talked straight to the sources so that we could corroborate that this is true. Dbva an intro. We'll make the world's first blockchain based corporate loan.

Speaker 1:          08:27          In this case, Indra is a Spanish engineering company and bb Va is a large Spanish bank. The idea is pretty similar to what we said about the house in San Francisco and this case bb va signs a contract with Indra and to all the members inside of the blockchain will have a copy of the same. So what's the advantage of all this? Well, it would prevent internal corruption. Some people might want to exaggerate the cost of some building in order to get her money into their pockets, but if they have a smart and everybody has a copy of this, then they can track every transaction. This means that both the company and the bank are protecting themselves from the iron workers, but we are only talking about loans here. As we said before, blockchain can be used for many other things and apparently Spanish banks, they want to pioneer this. Here's another example.

Speaker 2:          09:18          Sorry

Speaker 3:          09:19          Tom Dare to launch the first blockchain base. International money transfer service.

Speaker 1:          09:24          In this case we are talking again about a reducing verification times. You see anytime you make an international money transfer, you have lots of intermediary banks. For instance, if you want to send $1,000 to a friend in Germany or somebody has to verify that you have $1,000 less and your friend has $1,000 more after this, the problems from the currency exchange and you have lots of intermediaries that need to be in contact and verify every step of the process. Companies like a ripple used blockchain to do this. In a matter of seconds, and this is why it Santown death will now stop making international transfers from one day to the other.

Speaker 3:          10:00          In fact, both Santander and bb va has been investing in cryptocurrency companies for years. Main European banks have all been part of blockchain platforms for years from we trade to the Spanish Alaska area. But how big of future do these projects have? You simply don't know, but clearly there's an interest from traditional banks to not miss out on these kinds of new technologies.

Speaker 1:          10:26          And now I know what you might be thinking. So far we've just talked about faster transactions and safe a contract. It's nothing super exciting, right? So where is that revolution that some people are talking about? Well, believe me, there is certainly a potential revolution here, but we're going to talk about that in the coming week.

Speaker 2:          10:45          Send me

And that was your, so far we talked about banks using blockchain technology. What about cryptocurrencies? Yeah, Barclay's, yes, indeed. Barclays is offering services in Bitcoin, but will they use it as a normal thing? Well, we see all kinds of new services, thanks to cryptocurrencies.
