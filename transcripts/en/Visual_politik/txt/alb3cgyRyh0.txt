Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          let me start with question. Where do you think there is more inequality? Is it in silicon valley or isn't in Burundi? Exactly. The answer of course is silicon valley.

Speaker 2:          00:20          This is not actually necessarily bad news. For example, imagine that you work as a systems engineer at the Cisco officers in San Jose. You can make around $7,500 a month. Not Bad. Right? Well, if you could go that with your friends who works as a software engineer at Google, you're going to feel like a beg APP. Somebody in that position can easily make more than $11,000 a month. And of course all of that is pretty much pennies if you compare it to the earnings of your neighbors, Elon Musk and mark Zuckerberg or any of the other tycoons sniffing in the area. In other words, anybody would feel poor living amongst the people with the world's largest fortunes and yes, I can guess we were thinking, I mean it surely it's not so bad to live in a city where people are making $150,000 a year on average.

Speaker 2:          01:12          All right, so I can probably guess where you're thinking right now. You're probably thinking, well, living in the city web poor people make $150,000 a year is going to be a pretty good place to live, right? Well, yes, but as we say, things aren't always as good as they see in an area with so much concentrated wealth. Well, what do you think happens? Yup. Prices go absolutely. Sky High. For example, how much do you think you'd have to pay to rent a two bedroom apartment in mountain view? Mountain view, by the way, is where Google has his headquarters and do note here. We're not talking about a big metropolis like New York City or London. This town's population would fit comfortably in the middle of somewhere like, oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:56          All right,

Speaker 2:          01:57          so that being said, how much do you think you should pay $500 a month, $1,000 a month, $2,000 a month? Well after several google searches, the cheapest rent we could find was $3,400 the cheapest in general houses in Silicon Valley are 60% more expensive than elsewhere in America. And I know, I know with a salary of $11,000 a month for your more than happy to pay $3,500 a month in rent. Right? Well, absolutely. But let's just think for a moment. We've got to think about, well, what Silicon Valley really famous for, and it's famous for entrepreneurs. The main appeal of Silicon Valley is not working for facebook. It's for starting your own facebook. So now think about it. What do you really want to start a company in such an expensive place? Maybe knots, which explains this.

Speaker 1:          02:47          The tech

Speaker 2:          02:47          elite are abandoning silicon valley in droves because of group think and out of control. Living costs. Yeah, you have that right. In the year 2017 silicon valley had negative net for the first time in decades. This means there were more people leaving than coming in, and this is surprising if we take into account that this area of the world was growing like crazy since the year 1950 take mountain view. For example, in 1950 this town was no bigger than 6,000 inhabitants. Now it has more than 81,000 and the same map and with the rest of the area. Nonetheless, according to a survey, half of the residents are seriously considering leaving because of the high cost of living. Some of them have already left and among them is the man you see here.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Teal leaves Silicon Valley for Los Angeles and guys you've never heard of him. He gtl is something like Silicon Valley's Santa Claus along with Elon Musk. He's one of the founders of paypal. After that, he became a venture capitalist and we'd say he's basically facebook's godfather please. Steve was the one who put serious money into this company when it was taking its first baby steps, but the question now is why are there so many people leaving Silicon Valley? Is the cost of living really the only reason or are there others? And most importantly, is this the end of Silicon Valley as we know it? Well today we're going to answer all of those questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history country for entrepreneurs. Now in another visual politic video, we told you how a silicon valley startup gets financed. We talked about the so called startup financing cycle. And of course silicon valley is the best place on earth to find people ready to bat on your idea as another bonus. This place is the Disneyland of skilled workforces. If you want to start a company that manufactures self driving cars, you need people who've mastered the latest technology

Speaker 1:          04:49          drinks.

Speaker 2:          04:53          And the reality is you ain't gonna find them in the middle of Wyoming. The most talented people they gather in Silicon Valley and they're ready to hire or get hired. So well, what's the problem? Well, these tons of people you would like to hire for your brand new startup and now do busy earning $150,000 a year at Google. And yeah, your idea, it might be disruptive and it might be innovative, but yet can't compete with the salaries and especially the stability that a giant like a Google can provide,

Speaker 1:          05:22          right? Snap

Speaker 2:          05:24          a startup in a garage with the garage costs millions of dollars. Odd. Jay Ryan from Mithril capital talking to the economist, but this isn't the end of the story. Remember, California has the highest taxes in the entire United States and things. They don't just stop that. You see in America, states have plenty of autonomy to raise or lower taxes and can even decide how they want to collect those taxes. For example, the state of taxes, it doesn't have an income tax. Most of the taxes they collect the through in direct taxation, there's all the taxes that you pay on top of the things you buy. California, they're the opposite. They're very little value added tax and most of the collection comes from workers' salaries and especially capital gains.

Speaker 2:          06:10          In other words, if you're an investor and you're making a loss of money this year, you had better get your wallet ready because California is going to charge you more than anywhere else and this, this is not exactly great news when you consider that silicon valley is what it is because of venture capitalists. Nonetheless, this is not the only reason why people are leaving the valley. For example, Peter Teal hasn't left because of state taxes, otherwise he wouldn't have gone to Los Angeles, which is in California. The truth is that a lot of people like believe that Silicon Valley has lost all of the diversity that it used to be famous.

Speaker 1:          06:40          Hello,

Speaker 3:          06:44          Peter Teal. Silicon Valley has become a one party state.

Speaker 2:          06:47          Basically, Peter Teal supported Donald Trump during the campaign and apparently this kind of thing is not very well regarded in the valley where liberal thinking as King Allen's well, truth be told, there are many reasons why silicon valley people are not big fans of Donald Trump and well, that's explore those reasons.

Speaker 1:          07:05          Speed

Speaker 3:          07:08          One b

Speaker 2:          07:09          June. When I told you that the greatest amount of talent on the planet is located in Silicon Valley. Well, I didn't misspeak. I did mean planet and not just America. This means that 57% of the people working for the tech companies in the valley come from other countries. Yes, this is an industry with more immigrants on the locals and well, how do these immigrants get into America? Well, that's easy. They use the famous h one b visa.

Speaker 3:          07:34          Basically, this is a visa that allows you to stay on US territory for between three and six.

Speaker 1:          07:40          Cheers,

Speaker 3:          07:43          get it. You must be hired by a company that can prove that your skills are both necessary to its operations and that those skills cannot be provided by domestic work

Speaker 1:          07:53          groups

Speaker 3:          07:55          fired. You have one month to find another job. You can't find another job. You must leave America.

Speaker 2:          08:02          Of course, this visa is requested by the employer and the government can deny it if they want to. And most importantly, these visas are limited. They can issue a maximum of 65,000 in the entire country. As you can imagine. A good share of them. Go to those workers. Emigrating to silicon valley for a better understanding. Justin, the year 2016 google and apple hides more than 5,000 people through this process and of course you can probably work out what I'm going to say next. Donald Trump ain't exactly a fan of the h one b

Speaker 3:          08:34          trump's hire American order. It makes it harder to get h one b visas.

Speaker 2:          08:39          No, I don't know about you, but backwards. Donald Trump took office. We made a video where we explained all of the powers that the president has, these other things that he can do without having to get a vote in Congress. Border control is one of them and if you saw that video, which is actually one of the first we ever made on this channel, you will remember Obama was just as restrictive on immigration as Donald Trump us. The devil here is very much in the details and one of the details is this h one b visa. It's in fact a very small detail that makes a big problem in silicon.

Speaker 1:          09:13          Holly Silicon Valley's

Speaker 3:          09:18          stalls. Hiring a foreign tech workers, employer requests to interview candidates fall 37% on trump immigration fears

Speaker 2:          09:27          according to some media. Many of these tech companies might open new offices in countries like Canada where it's easier to hire immigrants, but so far we don't have any data as to whether this is actually happening or if it's ever really going to happen on the last, the question we can already start answering is this were good. The next tech capital of the welds be, well, we're going to tell you right now from Palo Alto to shenzen, if you google it, you'll discover that almost every city wants to become the new silicon valley. You just need to find a journalist who finds a couple of computer programmers working together and you've already got an article titled the Silicon Valley of

Speaker 3:          10:04          Insert name of your city or region. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          10:07          For example, there are lots of wishful articles that quoted Berlin as a startup creation hub. Even the German government is open to offices in silicon valley so that German entrepreneurs can find investors. But the truth is that almost no company has managed to seduce those big venture capital funds in California at least.

Speaker 2:          10:28          So the big question now is how do we know if a city is really becoming a technological capital? Well, one way of measuring this would be the number of Unicorns that have been born yet and say now might be asking, well, what's a unicorn beside, of course, the mythical beast. Well, a Unicorn is a startup that ends up with a valuation of over $1 billion. In 2017 57 startups became unicorns and from those 57 startups, 18 we're not American. In fact, China was their country of origin. Yes, he was. We're talking about companies like Dji, which manufacturers, drones and Alibaba, which we talked about here on visual politic previously, and it explains headlines like this one

Speaker 3:          11:12          in this latest growth market.

Speaker 2:          11:14          Yes. Venture capital, for example, sequoia capital. There's a vc fund to born in Silicon Valley. They have already opened several offices in China and I know what you're thinking. Does this really mean that China is going to mouth shine America? Well, the answer is no. Other cities like Mumbai in India and Tel Aviv in Israel have also attracted a lot of money from VC funds.

Speaker 3:          11:38          You might've heard of a company called a wix. This is a company that allows you to create websites very easily. Well, they're from Israel,

Speaker 1:          11:47          knew the

Speaker 3:          11:47          country, has no Unicorns, is real, does have more than 2% of all of the worlds of capital. That might not seem like a lot of money, but it is if we take into account the fact that Israel has a smaller population than New York

Speaker 1:          12:01          Si.

Speaker 2:          12:03          In summary, there is no clear alternative to silicon valley. Even now with the accidents we talked about, silicon valley still gets more than half of the money that's invested into startups and chances are they're going to continue to hold that sway over this industry for a long time. So what's the difference then? Well, now there aren't many other places where good ideas can prospect. In other words, 30 years ago, if you had a good idea and you wanted to see it grow, there was virtually one place to go. Now you've got many more in, well this is always good news.

Speaker 2:          12:34          So now the question is, do you think silicon valley has reached its peak in terms of growth or do you believe this accidents will stop soon and that the valley will start growing again?
