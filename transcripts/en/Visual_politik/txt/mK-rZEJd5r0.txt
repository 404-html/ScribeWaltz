Speaker 1:          00:07          I think there's one thing here we can all agree on the Internet has certainly changed our lives so much so that according to statistics, three out of every four Americans can't imagine life without music, news, shopping ads, especially video services such as this platform. Youtube have huge amounts of data flowing through them every day and it just keeps growing.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:31          that would be a plan for the Amazon is giving the delivery guy spare key all the apps, gps video when classroom connecting with another one continent in four time zones away, initials at the US State Department. We're so concerned about the anti Muslim videos that president trump retweeted yesterday.

Speaker 1:          00:59          According to Cisco's estimates just in the next five years alone, the United States will multiply its Internet traffic by three. In fact, in 2015, the United States matched and surpassed South Korea becoming the world's leader per capita in data consumption.

Speaker 2:          01:19          Sure,

Speaker 1:          01:23          and of course the Internet's this great virtual world is becoming more integrated with on lives to making up an increasingly larger share of our economic activity. So based on all of this, you can probably imagine two things. First, the massive amounts of infrastructure required by all of this consumption and seconds, how important Internet regulation is. Well, on the 14th of December 2017, the federal communications commission of the United States made a decision that could well be described as historic due to its transcendence and above all it's controversy. As you may know, the Federal Communications Commission decided by three votes against two to end so-called net neutrality. No one really is sure what will happen now that the government has changed the rules governing the worldwide. This regulation was approved in 2015 at the request of President Obama himself. Yup, you heard that right? The regulation known as net neutrality was born in 2015 within a short time twisted the media and practically every debate space was covered with this message with facing the end of the Internet. As we know.

Speaker 1:          02:40          By the way, this man is a GPI chairman of the United States is federal communications commission. And this story is main protagonists or we could say antagonist. What we've decided is that we need to restore the light touch market based framework that started in the 19 nineties. He is also probably one of the most hated people on the Internet. Well then maybe a couple of questions that we need to answer here. First, what was this regulation fundamentally about and seconds, what does this change really mean? What am I going to do in DC? For two years, CNC, thousand and 15, it was decided that the Internet would pass from being regulated by the first title of the communications locked to the second title. Well, that doesn't really help us, so what does that mean? Well, so you understand this better. We could say that with this change, the Internet, that is the service provision starting to be considered a public service and to be strongly regulated by the government in this case, by the Federal Communications Commission.

Speaker 4:          03:39          Ever since the Internet was created, it's been organized around basic principles of openness, fairness, and freedom. This set of principles, the idea of net and Trello, it has unleashed the power of the Internet and given innovators that chance to thrive, abandoning these principles would threaten to end the internet as we know it.

Speaker 1:          03:58          This is a regulation that among other things prevented American operators such as call Mecosta, verizon, or atnt, from being able to on the one hand block or slow down certain web spaces or applications. Traffic ends on the other, prevents other content providers from being preferred.

Speaker 4:          04:12          They should make it clear that whether you use a computer, phone, or tablet, Internet providers have a legal obligation not to block or limit your access to a website.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Imagine if a company decided to give priority to Netflix over hbo or a company that told spotify they needed to pay if they wanted their customers to be able to use their music services at high school

Speaker 2:          04:30          speed

Speaker 1:          04:32          with this regulation, companies at once able to charge fees that didn't include access to a certain service. Imagine, for example, if a business wants at a high speed connection that didn't consume netflix prime video or hbo videos, it wouldn't matter because with this previous regulation that have to pay for the entire service, the operators wouldn't be able to offer a rate without nationally

Speaker 2:          04:52          x

Speaker 1:          04:54          interview. Uh, this has all changed in the United States. Companies can now freely determine their rates. For example, by offering an internet that doesn't include being able to watch four k videos. Now, this doesn't mean that they will, but we will probably see different rates and merge and it is basically this which caused such controversy on the Internet.

Speaker 2:          05:21          It was so cool

Speaker 1:          05:22          virtual that only 107 out of the 239 Republican congressmen in the House of Representatives have made their support for this decision public. But do you think this is really that bad? Do you think that the Internet will no longer be the same? Well, in this video we want to show you the various arguments for and against net neutrality, Internet threat. Let's have a look at the dark side. The reasons why net neutrality defenders consider this change to be so negative, these points aren't by fascinating, so it won't take very long.

Speaker 1:          06:00          Those who detracts from the change that the Republican Party promoted base their position on two key arguments first that given that operators can now charge extra to both companies and customers, the cost of the Internet will go up in many small businesses and startups won't be able to compete with the larger ones because they won't be able to pay for preferential access seconds because it involves the ends of the freedom on which the Internet was built. Imagine if an operator decided to slow down or even block access to a means of communication. Theoretically, this could now happen.

Speaker 3:          06:30          Our Internet economy is the envy of the world because it is open to all this proposal. Tears at the foundation of that openness, enhanced broadband providers. The power to decide what voices to amplify, which sites we can visit, what connections we can make, and what communities we create. It throttles access stalls, opportunity and sensors. Content. Jessica Rosenworcel, member of the Federal Communications Commission bus

Speaker 1:          06:53          probably well versed on these arguments already considering how often they've been used in the media. How do they view? As you probably know that here are visual politic. We'd like to dig a little deeper so this time we also wanted to take a look at the net neutralities detractors side saying, well, let's go for it

Speaker 3:          07:15          also cow.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Those who support ending so called net neutrality have a clear perspective, a very competitive market as the best driver for innovation and ensuring good customer service, and one thing is certain. Literally the Internet emerged. It grew and developed fundamentally as a free space without the regulation known as net neutrality. This is what Marc Andreessen, netscape co founder and a key figure in facebook's birth says on the subjects.

Speaker 3:          07:47          A pure net neutrality view is difficult to sustain. If you also want to have continued investment in broadband networks. If you have these pure net neutrality rules, Rican never charge a company like Netflix. Anything. You're not ever going to get a return on continued network investment, which means you'll stop investing in the network and it would not want to be sitting here 10 or 20 years from now with the same broadband speeds we're getting today. Marc Andreessen medscapes cofounder.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Yes. This is one of the main criticisms they have used to support this change. Regulation discourages companies from investing as we've seen before. Internet traffic in the U, s has grown from Mendocino and recent years. How surprisingly investments in broadband infrastructure has stagnated and even decreased in the same span of time. This obviously isn't normal and it fuels one of the sectors, main problems in the United States, and that's a lack of competition in many parts,

Speaker 2:          08:53          but of course, if regulation

Speaker 1:          08:56          hinders and reduces the business's potential profitability, investment incentives are also substantially reduced. It's pretty logical, right? Another points claims by those supporting the end to Obama's regulation is that regulation could not only hurt investments, but it was also completely unnecessary.

Speaker 3:          09:14          Twenty years, the Internet has thrived under the light touch regulatory approach established by President Clinton and a Republican Congress. This bipartisan framework with the private sector to invest one point 5 trillion building communications networks throughout the United States and it gave us an internet economy that became the envy of the world at Gte pie

Speaker 1:          09:32          according to the supporters in the 20 years before net neutrality that is between 1995 and 2015. Internet access only expanded and improved in speed and quality. Around this time. The big digital companies we know today, Google, facebook, Netflix, Uber, they emerged. In fact, it's funny, but operators haven't really been the big winners of the Internet's birth, for example, Alphabet Inc, Google's parent company as a stock market value that's quite a bit bigger than the combined value of the three largest telecommunications operators in the United States. That for net neutrality to is wonder why change something that has worked so well since its inception. When is an operator restricted access to a means of communication? For example, g mail in facts, and this is what they use as an example. The only time something similar happens was when comcast trying to block peer to peer connections to stop illegal downloads. In the end, they have to back down because of bad publicity and pressure from authorities, but, and this is the third point here, less regulation does not mean anarchy. In fact, from now on in the United States, the Internet will be regulated by the powerful Federal Trade Commission, which is in charge of the antitrust policy, and operators will also have to comply with a strict transparency policy. They will have to communicate any policy that restricts or favors access speed to any digital service.

Speaker 3:          10:55          There's the sky's not going to fall down. The FTC is going to be a vigorous cop on the beat as it has been with respect to the Internet providers. John Liebowitz, former Obama era, FTC chairman,

Speaker 1:          11:06          well reform advocates proposed two examples of how the market can evolve without net neutrality. One is the mobile phone markets, which is much more competitive and it's always been at the limits of legality. The advocates say that in this extra users have seen reductions in their rates. While the services have improved. Nowadays, there are promotions that include unlimited access to services such as Netflix without data consumption, which clearly violates the spirits of and the second example they usually give is curiously founds in airlines, particularly the company jet blue. See, these companies weren't subjected to netsuite and you're trying to say, and in spite of that and having an agreement with Amazon's prioritize prime video consumption on board, they freely decided not to punish other services such as HBO. Our strategy for inflight Wifi is offer the best service at the lowest cost to as many passengers as possible, so we're motivated to support all content in a fair and neutral way. Mark Dank Berg, chief executive of Viasat Incorporated, the satellite company that provides jet blue's internet. Now we are facing a very complex question whether or not you agree with s and you try to see both detractors and opponents may have exaggerated it's consequence just a bit, but I think we're facing the end of the incidents and we must not forget that consumption tends to protect

Speaker 2:          12:28          freedom.

Speaker 1:          12:31          Yes. Now it is true that large parts of the United States, do you have a serious competition? Problem networks are only available from one or two companies and there isn't a market for choosing an operator, but fortunately new technologies such as five g, which will make more competition possible, they seem to be just around the

Speaker 2:          12:48          personally.

Speaker 1:          12:49          I'm left with one wish and that's that the internet remains as free as possible, but now it's your turn. What do you think of the end of net neutrality?
