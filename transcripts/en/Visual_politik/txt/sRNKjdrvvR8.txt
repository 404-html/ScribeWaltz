Speaker 1:          00:08          I think nobody will be surprised if I say that immigration is one of the most important issues in international politics and certainly both in Europe and in the United States lately. Everything related to this issue takes over most of the news and the front pages of the newspapers.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Immigration was the fault. All of the problems that were happening. What the administration has decided to do is to separate children from their parents to try to send a message that if you crossed the border with children, your children are going to be ripped away from you. That's traumatizing to the children for innocent victims and it is contrary to our values and this country. The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility will be because will be able to push that open door space at Columbia when she got down to granted. Granted all window, not deep

Speaker 1:          01:22          without going any further. Here are visual politic. We've already spoken a few times about this objects and soon we're going to post a special video first on our Patrion and then on youtube commenting and dismantling. Many of the myths and half truths that exist on this subject, and just before we get into the meat of today's video, speaking of Patriot on, let me thank everyone who is supporting us on Patrion and everyone who just watches us whereabouts across the half million subscriber mark, so that's pretty amazing and we couldn't do that without you, especially the people who do support us. Like I say on Patrion. Because of that, we are now publishing 50 percent more videos and we're now preparing lots of surprises and of course all of the other things that we have promised you, but for now, let's just crack on you at this time. I'd like to share some reflections with you, some ideas which I think we should keep in mind when we're talking about immigration. This is particularly important. If we consider that lately mistrust, fear and anti-immigration, political speeches. Well, the very much alive

Speaker 3:          02:34          get out of my country, I can still hear that sentence with absolute clarity as if it occupies a specific place in my mind. It's a scar deep within. The man who said, get out of my country was a trump supporter. I know this because he was wearing a pin identifying the then candidate on one of his lapels, but most of all, I know this because of the way he said it to me. He looked me straight in the eyes, pointed a finger at me and shouted, or he a journalist

Speaker 1:          03:00          from univision and a US citizen who was born in Mexico. One of the most typical and popular arguments of those who oppose immigration is stating that immigrants take odd jobs and take the money back to their own countries. You know, as long as we're not talking about messy you Christiane, or analogy, I know doll or maybe the writing stones there. Of course there's no problem, which is perhaps a bit hypocritical, don't you think? So now we come to the question, well, why do people decide to emigrate? Who are these people who pack their bags and leave their land? Who benefits from all of these movements? And in general, why is that such a negative perception of this phenomenon? Well then this video, I'm going to try and answer some of those questions, but first I think it's time we took a look back at how it all began, when, why, and where. By the way, what would you say if I told you that in some way your also an immigrants? Well, listen up. The origin from the very beginnings of humanity, people moved. Basically their motivation was to find food which forced them to move continuously from one place to another. Of course, back then borders didn't exist. The only limitation to moving from one place to another with how far one could travel.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Of course, all this began to change when modern societies emerged. That is when communities settled in a particular place where they worked to produce food tools and everything they needed to trade to live.

Speaker 4:          04:40          No.

Speaker 1:          04:41          One thing we can ask ourselves here is, did the migration phenomenon disappeared with this new way of life? Well, no, not at all. Once the first modern societies established themselves in certain places and governments began to emerge back around 3000 BC, migration didn't stop. All the motivations did change to large migration groups were created, so to speak, to groups with really different motivations. On the one hand that was conquering and on the other hands, there was searching for opportunities.

Speaker 4:          05:15          Yes,

Speaker 1:          05:19          the first conquest swerve movements carried out by societies that had achieved a higher level of developments and who wanted to take advantage of it to gain wealth from the people they call it

Speaker 4:          05:28          good

Speaker 1:          05:34          involved a migratory movement from the most developed countries to the less developed countries to monopolize their resources.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Although this phenomenon wasn't exclusive to any continent, the case that we all know best is perhaps that of the Europeans who managed to control almost the entire world starting with America, of course, this type of migration, it doesn't look anything like the migration that we have today. The second type of migration though it certainly does. We're talking about the peaceful mobilization of millions of people who seek to escape that territory of origin to reach another territory where they can find new and better opportunities. In this case, their drive is to search for economic improvements and sometimes also to escape political and religious persecution. Therefore, in general, we're talking about peaceful migrations from the least developed countries to the most developed countries, which is something like the opposite of conquest. The first launch case happens at the end of the Middle Ages when cities grew and people began to leave the country side to move to these cities. In many case this, it was a really slow process, but everything changed with the arrival of the industrial revolution. It's estimated between 1850 and 1930, almost $60 million Europeans, which was a huge percentage of the population at that time, emigrated to the Americas countries like the US, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina.

Speaker 4:          07:12          That's is

Speaker 1:          07:13          to say, despite all the political discourse against immigration, the truth is that Europe has a well defined history as an emigrant territory. Europeans first emigrated massively from the countryside to the cities. Then they moved around the wells and is now in our times. Millions and millions of Europeans have left their lands to live in another European Union country.

Speaker 1:          07:36          And what about the United States? Almost all of its population, if not all of it, comes from other countries or lives in territories that belonged to other countries, as is the case of the lands of California, New Mexico and Texas, which historically belonged to Mexico. So in a way we're all really the descendants of immigrants. In fact, if we take the current anti immigration demonstrations TV extreme, we could state that we are all immigrants in the regions in which we live. Now, the question we must ask is, well, what are the consequences of all of that? Could it have something to do with the fact that most of the richest and most developed countries in the wells have been exposed to the migratory process? Well, listen up, what history tells us what's that loud or say a clear. Most immigrants share a common goal to achieve a better life and more progress. It's true, some people with deep pockets or a good standard of living move from their country to grow professionally, have new experiences or maybe just live differently. These immigrants who usually arrive with a full wallet almost never awakened anyone's mistrust. However, same does not

Speaker 5:          08:56          apply to people who are escaping hunger, misery, all kinds of political, religious, and social prosecutions. These are immigrants who arrive with an empty wallet in search of new opportunities. This type of immigration is by far the most important and of course the one that generates the greatest mistrust, hostility and criticism.

Speaker 1:          09:16          However, this immigration is almost identical to our ancestors. We talking about people who are risking their lives and who decided to leave everything behind, which is certainly not easy, and all for what? Well the same as always do, achieve a better future to work and to prosper in a lawful way.

Speaker 3:          09:36          It'll is more extraordinary than the decision to migrate the accumulation of emotions and thoughts which finally leads a family to say farewell to a community where it has lived for centuries to abandon old ties and familiar landmarks and to sail across. Doc sees to a strange land. John F Kennedy, president of the United States of America.

Speaker 1:          09:56          Tell me who built America, who promoted the extraordinary economic take off this? Argentina saw at the end of the 19th century. Well, folks, it was the immigrants and the descendants of the immigrants, so why do we think of things as different today, but of course, when economic data shows that immigration drives growth and development, do youtube, higher employment levels, entrepreneurship and productivity, then anti-immigration critics, well, they make up other excuses. We're going to talk about them one by one in a future video with data and hands, but today I'd like to end this video with a reflection on one of the most important myths, fear and crime.

Speaker 6:          10:51          When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists.

Speaker 1:          11:05          One of the most widely spread myths is that immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, the so called illegals, are the ones responsible for most crimes and delinquency. Well, you know what? The data actually says that the opposite is true. Now, it is true that there are legal and illegal immigrants who commit crimes. However, let's look at an example. Let's look at what happens in the country with the most immigrants in the world. The United States say between 1990 and 2013, the number of undocumented immigrants known as illegal immigrants went from three and a half million people to approximately 11 million. However, in that same period, according to the FBI, the number of violent crimes dropped by 48 percent. Surprised well, if we take the crime data into accounts, he really shouldn't be. So according to an immigration policy center study, only one point six percent of immigrant men aged 18 to 39 end up in prison. Among those born in the United States, the data is three point three percent, so more than double Jack. This graph on crime levels in taxes, which is one of the states with the most legal and illegal immigrants. Yes, we can agree that we need to reorder the migratory processes, but stigmatizing immigrants and outlawing their condition only favors the human trafficking. Matthews, the evidence is clear. Immigrants trying to reach countries with high levels of freedom and more open economic systems in shorts, places where they can work and enjoy life without fear.

Speaker 1:          12:44          Therefore perhaps a good measure and maybe the only one to control the migrator reflow. It's a remote trade, private investments and democratic institutions in the countries that people are leaving, that's meanwhile developed countries can take advantage of immigration in the same way as other societies throughout history, immigrants view, uh, they want to work and then wants to prosper,

Speaker 5:          13:07          right?
