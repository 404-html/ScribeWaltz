Speaker 1:          00:08          Humans keep developing more and more powerful weapons and weapons, the ones they drones, and then our itinerary came along. Alan's quite literally blew everything else out of the water. And now today with airplanes, satellites, submarines and missiles, we have a gain that be changed the way we make this in facts, military innovation has produced many important technological advances, but it all does have a limit. The destructive effects of weapons of mass destruction or wmds has forced rules to limit their use of their production and their storage as well. This is completely necessary if we don't want the planet to be well completely destroyed, fight against nuclear proliferation. Wmds can be biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear, but the biggest problem we face are these nuclear weapons. This is due to their sheer destructive power and because thousands and thousands of them were accumulated during the arms race in the Cold War, we will develop a larger and more accurate c based ballistic missile. We will also deploy nuclear cruise missiles in some existing submarines in the 1960s seventies and eighties art and music and the civil movements took action against nuclear weapons. Maybe you remember flower power or at least you've probably heard of it.

Speaker 2:          01:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Songs which best represents the story of these years and they do recommend that you've got to listen to them. If you haven't already know, La Gay by orchestral maneuvers in the dark ends, 99 red balloons. Real challenge today is keeping North Korea or Iran from continuing that programs to develop wmds and further to keep such weapons out of the hands of terrorist organizations.

Speaker 1:          02:04          A nuclear crisis in Korea would be a tragedy and it would certainly affect globalization, trade and all very lifestyles. Now the problem here is quite condensed and we should really analyze it from a global perspective. As we said, there are international rules which limits to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. These rules are classified into two different categories, horizontal nonproliferation. This is meant to prevents countries which don't have these weapons from obtaining them and then there is vertical nonproliferation and this is meant to stop states already in possession of nuclear weapons, especially the US and Russia from increasing the number of nuclear weapons they have and even encouraging, reducing the stock piles, horizontal non-proliferation. The NP

Speaker 2:          02:50          horizontal

Speaker 1:          02:50          nonproliferation tries to prevent a new countries from joining the nuclear club as obviously it's specifically aims to prevent countries like Iran, North Korea, well as terrorist organizations from getting these weapons. Yes. You might remember now that we did another video on this where we talked about how the rules aren't really working so well in the case of North Korea. Well, this is what the NPT has achieved since 1968 in the early sixties it was estimated that by the year 2000 around 20 countries would hold nuclear weapons. Many countries like Algeria, Roger, Dina, Brazil, Spain, and Sweden had the ability to develop these weapons. However, thanks to the NPT and international leverage, very few states are in possession of these weapons today.

Speaker 3:          03:31          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          03:33          clear non proliferation treaty established at the five permanent members of the Security Council, which at first where the United States, the Soviet Union, China, France, and United Kingdom. We're the only nuclear powers and it forbade other states from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Speaker 3:          03:52          It looks great.

Speaker 1:          03:52          The members of the nuclear club, the five nuclear powers would commit to help the rest of the countries develop nuclear energy for civil public.

Speaker 1:          04:03          However, with time and despite all of this, some countries have succeeded in becoming nuclear powers today. Besides the five powers previously mentioned, four more countries have developed nuclear weapons. That's Israel, India, Pakistan, and to North Korea. And then there's Iran, which also try it. You'll probably know that during the Ahmadinejad administration, Iran tried to develop one of these bombs, and this would have meant there would be a significant threat to both Israel as well as the Middle Eastern Region. But fortunately, the international community took action to flank that possibility and the sanctions leveled by the Security Council, damaged Iran's oil and gas exports and badly and all of that international pressure. It has an impact because in the next elections, Rohani became the president of the country. He was a more moderate candidates to very harsh negotiations. In 2015 they reached an agreement in which Iran stopped its nuclear agenda and in exchange, the rest of the countries would lift sanctions on exports, which was good news in a country like Iran or wary lack of exports was causing significant damage to its economy. Well, now we come to North Korea ans maybe we should let it to leader speak for himself.

Speaker 4:          05:06          Median Kim doing it. Don't get caught. Some God that he does.

Speaker 1:          05:12          We don't exactly know what weapons North Korea possesses or there's some estimates say as we mentioned in a previous video, could it's from 10 to 20 bombs. These are unsophisticated but still powerful enough to trigger a significant crisis. For this reason, the United Nations Security Council has strengthened the penalty system for North Korea after the last underground detonation in September of 2016 the presses even dead to speculates that the might be preventative and military action against North Korea by the trump administration. However, American experts are wanting this military action could trigger a military response with wmds as well as conventional weaponry or war in the Korean peninsula would mean a human catastrophe and it would negatively affect the world's economy. It would most of all affected neighbors, China, south, and Japan, and the mere existence of this threat of war could lead to a terrifying arms race in the region and it could even make Japan take exceptional measures. This is something we've talked about in a previous video that you can see here. That is why it's important for China to end it's friendly relationship with North Korea. It's not going to end well for China. More overwhelmed,

Speaker 2:          06:16          general vertical non-proliferation. Wow,

Speaker 1:          06:22          awesome. A vertical nonproliferation. During the Cold War, the u s and the Soviet Union developed more and more powerful nuclear weapons in greater and greater numbers. Each country needed to have more into better weapons than the other two. These stored thousands and thousands of nuclear warheads. They also increased their means of delivering aircraft, missile submarines all to an extent that had previously not even been imagined

Speaker 4:          06:47          during the cold war arms race. The global nuclear stockpile peaked in 1986 at about 70,000 nuclear warheads according to the Federation of American scientists, enough to destroy the earth several times.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:05          In Louisiana is the woman he tests with nuclear weapons conducted in the atmosphere, in the sea, in space, and sometimes whether intentionally or not, they used people as Guinea pigs do analyze the effects of radioactivity in humans. It was all a pretty terrible time. The Japanese artist Hashimoto has prepared a video where you can see the different nuclear tests since 1945

Speaker 1:          07:29          it looks like a video game, but it's not. Fortunately with the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia agreed to reduce the nuclear arsenals as well as their means of delivery. Under President Obama written April, 2010 the staunch treaty was signed in Prague. This treaty agency limit strategic weapons, so each country would only hold 1,500 nuclear bombs like the year 2018 but still that is way too many bombers. There are also other rules to limit missiles and means of delivery and of course, no more nuclear testing is permitted. So ctbt is a treaty which completely forbids any nuclear tests and no more tests have been carried out since 1998 with the exception of course being North Korea. Anyway, the conclusion of all of this is that yes, we must definitely stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Iran or North Korea and we sat and we have to prevent terrorist groups from laying their hands on these WMDs, but the nuclear arsenals that still exist in the u s and Russia should also keep reducing because among other things, the risk of misuse and lack of control of these weapons is waste presence in the world we inhabit today and to dependence and globalized wars.

Speaker 1:          08:34          They don't make any steps. Bernard Brodie, the North American strategist already said this after World War II

Speaker 4:          08:41          thus far. The chief purpose of our military establishment has been to when Moore's from now on its chief purpose must be to avert them

Speaker 1:          08:50          in the u s president John F. Kennedy was a pioneer in the search of peace and nuclear disarmament.

Speaker 2:          08:55          Okay.

Speaker 5:          08:58          Too many of us think it is impossible to many think it is unreal, but that is a dangerous your fetus believe. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable, that mankind is doomed, that we are gripped by forces we cannot control. We need not accept that view our problems, a manmade, therefore they can be solved by man

Speaker 1:          09:34          in a world dominated by nuclear weapons. Kennedy's he refused to conduct any nuclear tests in the atmosphere and he was criticized for that in his own country. However, we could have avoided so much suffering and saved a huge amount of money if the wells had just listened to Kennedy's ideas on nuclear weapons. So I really hope you enjoyed that video.
