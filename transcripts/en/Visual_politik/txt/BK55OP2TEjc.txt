Speaker 1:          00:07          In the last few years, there has been growing uncertainty and concern over what's the future of jobs will look like, especially for those who are in developed countries, robotics, Ai, immigration, international competition. They are all hot topics.

Speaker 2:          00:21          Six,

Speaker 1:          00:26          according to some people, we will have to get used to a future where a job will be considered a luxury, a world of unemployment on a massive scale. It'll be a world of higher inequality, of poor working conditions, and that's just for those who aren't lucky enough to have it.

Speaker 2:          00:40          Job

Speaker 1:          00:46          is not the west of us. Most of the people who are foreseen such a critical situation also claimed this and less major changes take place and we try to slow down this frantic developments. Our wellbeing will be in serious danger, certainly if there are not enough jobs, wealth and production will concentrate in a reduced but powerful oligarchy of businessmen and companies. And this leads to the question, how will ordinary people make a living who will pay taxes? How can the welfare state possibly survived for with so much unemployment's? It all sounds pretty dreary, doesn't it? Almost as if we're going to be facing a terrible storm many year now. This uncertainty, it's made it easier for leaders like Donald Trump or marine le pen, among others to get a leg up in politics. Indeed. Leaders who say that society is falling apart and insist that they are the only ones who can fix it.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Do you tend to do rather well? Well, if there is such a thing, then the only thing we can do is fight back and it is not just immigration we're talking about here. Oh No, there is so, so much more. Amazon is doing great damage tax paying retailers, towns, cities and states throughout the u. s are being hurt. Many jobs being lost at real. Donald trump on twitter, but hold on just a second because are we really had such a dark and dreary future? Our robots are really going to take our jobs and destroy the system as we know it. And is it true that unless we take radical action, we are in serious danger of losing our jobs? Well, in order to answer these questions and look at what lies beneath these statements, we have to pay close attention to what is currently happening in the world we live in and especially what is going on in the greatest and most influential power on earth. Yes, of course, we're talking about the United States of America,

Speaker 2:          02:28          the end of employment,

Speaker 1:          02:32          self driving cars, self learning machinery, factories without work as intelligent robots, less science fiction, then more science facts every single day. And you know this technological wave. It's just begun. Nanotechnology, biotechnology, genetic engineering and robotics. They seem to be changing the world as we know it every day. These technologies, multiplying productivity and they can even replace human work in a report to the president from 2000 and Sixteen Council of economic advisors in the White House calculated that 83 percent of jobs that were paid less than $20 per hour would soon potentially be automated. In other words, countries with a faster development in robotics will be the first to suffer from high sudden unemployment. Millions and millions of people will simply become unemployed, but the question now has to be, is this really what the future holds the future? I mean it's always uncertain, but we can already see what's happening today and compare that to what it's going to be like in the future. Robots, they've already arrived and we can find them everywhere in today's factories and if we really dive into the figures, we see that the evidence shows the exact opposite of what we might expect. So just take a look at this chart here. The countries using the most robots, other countries with the lowest rates of unemployment as well. This it has an explanation. Sometimes we consider all the jobs that are lost as a result of this process, but we ignore the new jobs that are being created as a result of all of this automation,

Speaker 1:          04:04          new times, new jobs.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Up until

Speaker 1:          04:08          now, the industrial sector is the one when most robots have been used. In fact, some companies like Ford already have assembly lines made entirely out of robots having no human workers at all. Yet, American industrial production is almost as high as it has ever been, and now you must be wondering, well, what happens to all the industrial jobs? Well, have a look at this. That's right in the 19 forties, one of every three jobs in America where industrial jobs and now the number is barely one in 12, which is four times less. So does this mean that there are no employment opportunities in the United States? Well, actually, nothing's further from the truth. Since the 19 forties, the US has created more than 86 million new jobs in the service industry. This includes transport, finance, entertainment, and so on and so forth. As a matter of fact, there has never been so many workers in this country and while we are specifically talking about robotics here, the impacts of any new technology, it has a similar effect.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Blockbuster, which was once the largest video and video game rental company in America may have vanished. Putin exchange. We have new companies like Netflix or even youtube and these kinds of companies. They generate loads of jobs, but this is not just happening in America and it's not just happening with robots or with video. Consider the APP industry in Australia. This new industry has already created more than 113,000 jobs in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. I believe me, this is not just an Australian phenomenon in the United States and deberry mind that this is a new sector that has been born just a few years ago with the iphone and it's already created one point 5 million jobs. Banks, supermarkets, insurance and software companies. They all want to have their own app and that means new jobs are being created all of the time. Further, as productivity grows, normal working hours, they're reduced, so thanks to technology will work hours, which is another bit of great news.

Speaker 1:          06:04          I think for the next 30 years. People only work four hours a day and maybe four days a week. My grandfather worked 16 hours a day in the farmland and thought he was very busy. We work eight hours five days a week and we think we are very busy. Jack Ma and finally let's as a little more detail, some people like Bill Gates, they've claimed the robots have taken jobs that were previously done by people. Then therefore they should have to be paying tax and you know what? Well, I'm not so sure about that. I need robots. They are just machines. Simply the more machines and the more technology we have, the better we live. Robots reduce costs and as a consequence they reduced the price of goods and this. It allows consumers to work less and buying more, and this is why governments should boost and encourage investment in technology, but what is certainly true, it's the society will have to prepare for this automation process, this technological change. It is coming and it shouldn't be stopped. Stop globalization. Have you who regularly follow up visual policy will know that trump has something of an obsession with China,

Speaker 2:          07:11          China, China. I love China all the time. I Love Jack.

Speaker 1:          07:18          It's not just China. In the last year, trump is accused Canada, Mexico, Japan, and even South Korea of unfair competition. He has also claimed that these countries are destroying American jobs. This is why trump wants to renegotiate trade agreements, empower protectionist policies, and if needed, set import tariffs in industries such as the steel industry. It wouldn't be the first president in the US to pursue this kind of strategy. We need look no further than that. George W dot Bush and other Republicans who set up import terrorists to steel imports in 2002. President Bush took some of the broadest federal action in two decades to protect a major American industry today, imposing tariffs of up to 30 percent on most types of steel imported into the United States from Europe, Asia, and South America, and truth be told the result, it wasn't good. Some studies have estimated that these steel tariffs resulted in the loss of more than 200,000 jobs.

Speaker 2:          08:19          Yep.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Not Policy lead to more unemployment's less competition. Argentina, it's another great example. Protectionism has had exactly the same results.

Speaker 1:          08:33          That's of course, last exports also means less drops, but that's not the end of it. Now, it is true that in the last few decades, industrial offshoring has caused us to lose many jobs, but in a way thanks to this, countries like China have had an opportunity to develop and Chinese businesspeople are now eager to invest in the United States, seeing it as a safe place to make an investment in 2016 Chinese companies invested at $50, billion dollars in the US and today these companies have employed directly and indirectly more than a hundred and 48,000 Americans. That's nine times more than they were employing in 2009. That is indeed the case of this businessman Mr Wang man who spent in 2014, $700,000,000 restoring a factory that General Motors had closed down.

Speaker 2:          09:18          Hi.

Speaker 1:          09:21          And it isn't just Chinese companies, one in every five Americans is currently working for foreign companies. And remember, as we said before, never have been so many people working in the United States. So the story of globalization being effected, destroying our economies. Well, it seems like it's just that it's a story. Prints are stealing our jobs.

Speaker 2:          09:48          You will

Speaker 1:          09:48          note that this is one of the biggest issues for people, especially in the United States. They're taking our jobs, they're taking our manufacturing jobs, they're taking our money, they're killing us, Donald Trump. That is what trump has been saying, but the reality is that the facts tell a completely different story. For instance, in 2016, the United States got six Nobel prizes in science and economics. All of them were awarded to immigrants. People born in a different country that now work at universities in the US and immigrants. They tend to be more inclined towards entrepreneurship as well, so even though immigration accounts for 50 percent of the workforce in America, immigrants are involved in creating one out of every three new companies in the US, and those companies are the ones that are creating the most jobs. And look, there are two types of immigrants. On the one hand, we've got the illegal immigrants.

Speaker 1:          10:37          They usually work in more physical jobs or the jobs Americans don't usually once and on the other hands, we have legal immigrants. Half of these immigrants have higher education. This is a percentage far higher than people born in the US. This type of immigration, it provides vital brainpower to a country, and this is something that countries desperately meat. They also have an entrepreneurial spirits and many of them are responsible for many successful projects. Procter and gamble, Goldman Sachs, Yahoo, Google, Tesla, att and t, Intel, Ebay, IBM, Citi Group, ups, Oracle, Amazon, or even apple or some of the many companies founded or co founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants. So hopefully you can see that the best thing about immigration is that not only does it not steal jobs from Americans, it actually creates more jobs for them. So there's a lot of legends when it comes to predicting the future of our lifestyles, but the reality is that the facts simply don't live up to the fear.

Speaker 1:          11:33          So there are a lot of legends when it comes to predicting the future of our lifestyles, but the reality is that the facts, they simply don't live up to the fear.
