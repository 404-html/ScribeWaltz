Speaker 1:          00:08          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          we may not like it, but we can't see that corruption in Argentina bans in most countries. Is anything new? The truth is that since the first government meeting back in 1810 virtually no Argentine government has been free of suspicion.

Speaker 3:          00:27          Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:27          Possibilities are almost endless and the incentives are very, very generous. I don't think it's just a matter of sticking your hands in and your done because most corruption cases, they're far more convoluted than this. However, what has been uncovered in recent years, it does go much, much further. We're talking about the realization that in Argentina there has been a systematic process led by the nation's own government with the object of looting, the country's public treasury on a far larger scale, and we don't talking about the occasional bribe, but billions of dollars that given the evidence seemed to have been stolen during the Peronist governments of Nesta catch now and Cristina Fernandez de coach. Now, more news comes almost daily, but the goal of this video is to tell you how it all started, what happens and how this plot worked. A plots which the very presidency of the republic was involved in, as well as dozens of politicians, judges, officials, and as many of the most important businessmen in the country.

Speaker 2:          01:30          This looting operations plus known as the notebooks began with the arrival of Nesta coachnet in May of 2003 and continued under the presidency of his wife Cristina Fernandez. The catch now until 2015 that is to say the systematic pillaging of the public coffers happens for more than a decade. Now. Before we look into what this consisted of and how much money it meant for the origin times, we have to answer some questions about the real protagonists of this story, the consciousness we need to look at who they are, how they got into power, and how have they managed to set up what is perhaps the biggest operation in the history of stealing from Argentina's public coffers. So listen up.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:15          Kerschner is a sentence, provincial politicians who managed to own Argentina for years, so it all began with a beautiful love story between two young university students, Nesta. I'm Christina Matt in the mid seventies while studying at the National University of La Plaza in Buenos Aires, love as soon blooms and in 1976 after the military coup led by left Tenant General Jorge at Rafael v dealer or two lovers decided to leave and work as lawyers in the city of Rio gay golf's in the province of Santa Cruz, a city Bonnie, of the way that is far away from the capitol. Indeed, it's more than 2,650 kilometers away.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Okay. If

Speaker 2:          02:56          we had been asked about that couples particular future at that time, we probably wouldn't have mentioned anything about national politics. However, after democracy returned in 1983 this nice lawyer couple joins the Peronist party and it was their folks that the career of those who became Argentina's underwood's ready began. Well, now that we actually think about it, it was probably the underwoods who became the consciousness of the political series. It was a relationship made by and four power first in 1987 Nesta catch no was elected mayor of Rio de. I'll send a few years later in 1991 governor of the province of Santa Cruz. Then finally in 2003 he became president of the Republic of Argentina and during this time, Christina Fernandez didn't stay on the sidelines. She made her career in the legislative chambers as provincial deputy national deputy national senator until in 2007 she arrived at the presidency of the republic and then in 2015 she went back to the Senate. Yes, it seems like the couch and has had it very, very clear between the legal profession and politics, politics more than 30 years of living off taxpayers, certainly something of a career. However, just a moment. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:07          I'm not going to be not a funny image need that you see though, if he throws, Hello Ziff Santa Cruz,

Speaker 2:          04:24          which is where the coaching has began. Their political career isn't only far from the capitol, which after all is the center of power. In 2001 it's population didn't even reach 200,000 inhabitants. It was about 0.5% of the country's entire population, which at the time was approximately 36 million people. So how did to politicians are a place that is so far from the core of power and so small take control of the entire country. This is the question that many journalists and political analysts have been asking for a long time. Well, now we're beginning to unravel the onset. Basically, this husband and wife duo took over, co opted and bought almost every sector of Argentinian politics through the power of their wallet.

Speaker 4:          05:09          No, look, grandma, they didn't know [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:21          businessmen, trade unionist, judges, journalists, artists, and civil society leaders succumbed to the power of the state's wallet. It was billions of dollars distributed among the pockets of those who supported and his word unconditional supporters of this peculiar marriage [inaudible] tell network fed and greased by concessions, aid and subsidies that were conveniently distributors and which nobody controlled. However, the question that we have to ask ourselves is, how did they finance it? How did the connection is maintained such an ample wallet? Well listen up,

Speaker 1:          05:52          grandmas that to see it.

Speaker 5:          05:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:05          goal of public works.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Okay,

Speaker 2:          06:09          look, good. Watch Cristina Fernandez said in 2010 for us, for this administration, public work isn't a contingency. It's a conviction, a structural political concept that we've been developing not only since 2003 but since we gained the responsibility of directing a community's destiny. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, while now we know why public works were so important for this marriage and no, I'm sorry, but it has nothing to do with Argentina's interests. Public work was one of the core parts of the catch in his political fabric, first in the province of Santa Cruz and then throughout the entire country. Now, some of you might be wondering, well, Simon, hold on a second. How did the system actually work? Well, you'll see that deep down it was actually quite simple. President Kartchner three as minister of federal planning and public investment, Julio Davido, he stayed in this post for the entire period in which the catch and is headed. The country met periodically with the main construction companies in Argentina, which in turn were convened by the president of the Chamber of Construction. Call us vogner. Well, in these meetings, it was agreed exactly which company would get each public tender. That is essentially, they were meeting to decide how to distribute the case.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:22          When everything was decided, the tender procedure actually started, but this was simply familiar appearances. The company which was chosen was the one that this kind of public works cartel had previously. Agreed. Okay. Now comes the key to the entire process. Once the work was granted, the companies charged the first installment of the contracts, the advanced payments they needed to supposedly begin working. However, this payments was given in higher lead to the politicians.

Speaker 5:          07:50          Doris, they can see me and go, [inaudible] [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible] else, you know,

Speaker 2:          08:02          sorry. Hold on a second. Where was the business if these companies had to pay back what they charged? Well, that was in the extra costs.

Speaker 1:          08:13          Okay.

Speaker 2:          08:14          It's estimated that on average, each project's extra cost ranged from between 30 and 40% of the total bill. That way. If work was grounded for 100 million budget expansions were approved for up to a total of approximately 140 million, but that's not all. Sometimes the government would also prove changes and new project expansions until the company that had been awarded the $100 million work ended up charging a lot more on ac 200 250 million and even up to 2.8 times the initial budgets because I mean in this example, 280 million and to top it all off at many of these projects, they weren't even finished. Yup. You heard that right? Of course. In exchange for this bargain, companies paid bribes to politicians depending on the case between 10 to 20% of the invoiced amount. Having said that, have you ever wanted our public work functions in your country? The thing is that this thing worked perfectly for years, but now while it's been exposed

Speaker 6:          09:07          and did it for 700 book it, but I said not neglecting him. [inaudible] seizures in Brazil. Fico, no, no, no. Why not?

Speaker 1:          09:29          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:30          Discovered sole details really counts out when one doesn't take care of all the details. Even the most complex and ingenious operations run. The risk of collapsing this case was not an accent.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:46          See, it turns out that the driver who transported the government's bribe collector was obsessed with writing down each trip, each stuffed, each building visitors the name of the people he was going to see for the briefcase delivery. Even the conversations he had during his travels, he had written down practically everything in eight notebooks. We don't know if he did it on impulse for entertainments, if it was part of the kind of control and accounting system, or perhaps even simply wanted to cover his back. The reality is though, that these notebooks contain all the details of this matthew,

Speaker 2:          10:17          and finally those new books came into the hands of a journalist who upon seeing what they contained, decided to turn them over to justice. And after months of investigation, at the end of July, 2018 high officials and businessmen linked to this plot where arrested. But that's not all. Now, many of these people have decided to collaborate with the Justice Department in exchange for benefits such as not being in prison while the process continues. I'm one of those individuals is Carlos Wagner, the president of the Chamber of construction, the man who called the companies and one of the people who benefited most from this entire mass. His story confirms everything. The notebook set and the other testimonies they went in the same line right now. I'm sure you might be wondering, well, all right Simon, but how much money are we really talking about here? Well, the reality is it is a ton of money. See if Collins Wagner is telling the truth, the cartoonist would have received almost $3 million a day and they did that for that entire 12 and a half years in government. That is more than $12 billion in total and that's only from the public works, but something just the public works. There are many more suspicions of corruption and pending cases.

Speaker 6:          11:24          Yes,

Speaker 2:          11:25          I actually got $12 billion to pay politicians, judges, journalists, social leaders, and of course fill their own pockets. Everything indicates that this is how the Kushners came to power and consolidated their power over Argentina.

Speaker 6:          11:39          For example,

Speaker 2:          11:40          this will say Jose Lopez case, a format public work secretary and someone who was very close to Julio to veto the catch and arrest minister who managed the plot well in June of 2016 having been alerted that the police could rate as house as of an investigation, he decided to leave at three in the morning with $9 billion that he had in cash hidden under his mattress. Anyway, that night, Lopez trying to hide the money in a confidence, the confidence of the praying and Pennington nuns of our lady of the rosary of Fatima, but this didn't have the best of luck. Lani was stashing the money. A neighbor who thought that it was a robbery called the police and that's how good Aalto seemed. Lopez was caught red handed and yes, we'd know where all that money probably came. Right. As you can imagine, this money couldn't simply be transferred to a bank. No, it had to be paid in cash so it wouldn't leave a trace. It was moved in bags. Well, since they made so many payments, the people in charge of filling the bags already knew how many money wads fit into each bag. So it seems that the money was no longer counted in millions, but simply by number of bags.

Speaker 1:          12:44          Wow.

Speaker 2:          12:46          Do not forget the companies also made money by overpricing. So the damage to the Argentine people has been even greater anyway. Dvo this is the grease of story of how some politicians decided to plunder their own country. If the facts are confirmed, even the underwoods would be scandalized by Argentina situation. So well, Christina Fernandez end up in jail. Well, I need time will tell. So I really hope you enjoyed this video. Please do hit that long version if he did.
