Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          They're all team types of companies. Those that sell a product to a customer and those where the customer is the product. Tinder belongs to the second group.

Speaker 2:          00:20          Why would you choose tinder before any other dating app? No, all the answers. That's pretty simple. It's because it's full of users. This means that the real product, it is not a website or a service. Do you have you on tinder, the product is you, and here is where the big question comes in. How would you start a dating app? I mean, imagine you and your friends decide to start a company like tinder. Well, the first thing you need is lots of people using it, right? But these men and women then are going to use it if they don't see a lot of other men and women using it. You see where I'm coming from here? This is why tinder with over 200 million users is one of the most surprising successes in business history. So how did they get started? What did they do better than their competitors? Well today we're going to answer this question and in order to do so, we're going to ask one of the biggest experts in the industry, and that's Mark Brooks, who's the president of idea, a group that represents the biggest dating apps on the planet. He has spent more than 25 years in the online love industry and he's also the brains behind many of the dating sites that you probably know

Speaker 3:          01:25          Hello Simon and the hell is all of visual politics subscribers. As you said, the key to being successful with a dating service is as we call it, having a critical mass of activity. This means having enough active users, so on average one out of five messages get an answer.

Speaker 2:          01:44          How'd you get there? This is where economics strategy and math comes into play and you might be wondering, why are we talking about this on visual politics? What does tinder have to do with all of the things we usually cover on this channel? Well, actually a lot. Listen up in this survey, one out of five heterosexual couples in America got to know each other through a dating site. In the case of same sex couples, this figure is more than 70% in other words, dating online has changed our society and this,

Speaker 3:          02:15          this is also politics nonetheless, despite what it looks like, the online dating industry, there's still a virgin industry. In total. We make around $5 billion a year around the world, which isn't that much really relative to other industries. For example, the underwear industry has more than 10 times bigger than the online. Personal is industry.

Speaker 2:          02:36          Yup. You heard that right? We're talking about an industry where making a profit is seldom easy.

Speaker 3:          02:42          Besides that, there's a hyper concentrated industry. Basically, most of the dating sites, including tinder, belong to the very same group match group. This is a Nasdaq listed company that has smashed or required most of the competitors at this stage, but still the middle

Speaker 2:          02:56          question is how did the tinder creators managed to such a successful app? What kind of lessons can we learn from tinder that could be applied to other kinds of businesses? Well today we're going to answer these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history. The love, the Haemus. I know, I know it won't come as a surprise if I tell you that dating sites are as old as the Internet itself for a better understanding in the year 1991 Tim ben is, he created the first website in history, well three years later, the first dating site, whether personals was launched. And as you can imagine we all just talking about finding your significant other at the time. Other sides like adult friend finder where created to

Speaker 3:          03:45          nonetheless, most of these websites were pretty rudimentary back then. Nobody talked about user experience or complex algorithms were personal. So there's just an online version of the good old classified ads that you had an newspapers, but you could search more quickly and send messages to the contacts, which was huge. And overall the biggest problem was they had very few users. Hmm. And most of the cases you would create a profile and find just a few geeks today. But all of this changed with the advent of match.com match. The comb was the real game changer that make no mistake, they didn't have an especially good algorithm or a better user experience. In fact, their asset was just one word. Money match.com started out with just a small improvement over the classified ads in newspapers, but they realize the future was online during the early years. They tried different formulas for the turning point came in the year 1999 that was the year when I see a multinational Bolton mashed or calm for $50 million and believe me, that was enough money to do great things.

Speaker 2:          04:56          All of a sudden this company could invest heavily in advertising and this advertising budget, let them get to that critical mass sooner than anybody else, but not only that. match.com was the first one to import the concepts of the white label to the dating world. So what made match.com so unique? Well, they had technology to improve online dating, but what did they need while they needed more users and who had the most users back then? While that would be msn.com remember old Microsoft and messenger? Well, back then this was the most used messaging software on the planet. They were having to offer a brand new dating service to their users and this is why msn personals was nothing but the match.com engine with another logo

Speaker 3:          05:40          with this aggressive strategy manager come close, similar deals with other Internet juggernauts like Yahoo. And this is how in so little time they smashed the competitors. In fact, today, this company is so big, it's listed on the Nasdaq index and they represent one fifth of the entire industry.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:00          I ain't know what you now thinking. Who could compete with such a ban off at the end of the day with so much money for advertising and the power to close the best business deals? Who could come out from under that shadow? Well, believe me, the battle, it had only just started

Speaker 3:          06:17          despite mashed up calm being such a big company, the service was pretty lame. It is true. They had lots of users, but a minority of people found a natural match. This explained why the retention rates were so low. In fact, people signed up into metro con and they left after just three months. Most what does satisfied

Speaker 2:          06:33          this left a big vacuum for a better competitor with a better strategy. And the winning strategy was we do promise and over deliver. Imagine we start a business to make money. The logical move would be to get paid for the service. Right? Well it doesn't actually have to be that way. The founders of plenty of fish. A proofing. Yeah. 2003 this website was the first one to offer their services completely for free. So how did they make money? Well, the answer that's kind of obvious. It's bad advertising.

Speaker 3:          07:11          Many of you will not be surprised with this, but back in the time this was a revolutionary idea being based on ads. Plenty of fish was heavily incentivized to make sure the users would spend a lot of time on the site. The longer they use the service, the more ads they would see. But this is not

Speaker 2:          07:26          the end of the story. The strategy of plenty of fish could not be more counter intuitive. So here's a question. Let's say that you're starting your own dating site. What kind of pictures would you put it on the front page? Would you pick ugly or beautiful people? Would you use an attractive, elegant web design or a very simple and sketchy one? Well, my guess is you'd go for beautiful people in a smart design, right? Well, actually plenty of fish did the opposite. Their motto was happy are those with no expectations because they will never be disappointed.

Speaker 3:          08:01          In other words, under promise and over deliver. In order to avoid the website taking forever to download. Plenty of fish wander to use low res pictures. There's men are very unattractive design. They made sure where their users that they wouldn't find top models, but they'd find normal people, real people, even their orange made clear that they didn't want to lie to anybody. Plenty of fish, simple free, and it works.

Speaker 2:          08:23          This model was so disruptive that they soon found imitators. Other websites like purdue followed in their footsteps. And guess what happens when plenty of fish became successful? Well match.com the ban off of the industry does not like competitors, so they made them an offer they couldn't refuse. Basically they did a buy them for what the company was worth, but by the amounts of money, match.com was losing by having them as competitors and well, it was a lot of money, but many of you might believe that with such a solid business model and as a part of match.com nobody could take on plenty of fish rice. Well you aren't wrong ones again. Tindering outside of the box. Yep. It's true. Fancier fish seems like the perfect website. Millions of users, simple design, happy customers. But there was a problem. It didn't work on mobile phones and as if this wasn't enough and everything was proud of the fact that they were using plenty of fish. Now I know this is probably going to surprise the millennials watching this video, but until recently, the online dating industry was kind of a pretty shameful pastime. And the last thing that you'd confessed to your friends,

Speaker 3:          09:31          and this is when the tinder founders came in ready to change the rules of the game forever. Tinder was the first dating APP design that we've fully mobile first. No computers or laptops, just cell phones. And how do you think they got what that critical mass of users? Well, you might think that being an internet app, they use online ads to promote themselves. Right. So the opposite was true.

Speaker 1:          09:56          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:56          The strategy of tinder was 100% offline instead of ads or big marketing campaigns. The tinder founders organized parties at American universities more. Exactly the coolest fraternities and sororities. If you wanted to attend to the most glamorous parties, you had to download the APP to your mobile phone and it wasn't sold as a dating APP. In fact, it was a game.

Speaker 3:          10:17          In fact, the goal of the 10 to founders was not to sell true level of significant others. The motto was, we are playing tinder. Let's play and see who is the most popular in the party would have put it on their own terms. Let's see who gets the biggest share of life.

Speaker 2:          10:33          The idea of competing for popularity was nothing new. Mother websites like hot or not offered people the chance to upload their pictures so others could rank them from zero to 10 but tins are made everything simpler. It wasn't about ranking, but instead it was a matter of yes or no or in tinder towns swipe right or swipe left

Speaker 3:          10:56          often does real success can be explained with the theories at the so called behavioral economist. Authors like Daniel Conaman talk about two kinds of behavior, some of the basics

Speaker 4:          11:05          in NATO operations functions that we have such as perceiving things, having emotional reactions to things. All this is system one. We don't choose what just happens to us.

Speaker 3:          11:19          The so called system one or intuitive fast decision making and the so called system to all logical and slow decision making. By limiting the range of choices, we can easily approach people's emotions easier. So tend to dumb down decision making to the purest emotional element element.

Speaker 2:          11:35          In other words, mobile first design, gamification and perfect expansion strategy made at tinder, the most loved APP in American universities. Instead of hiding it, people told everybody they were using it and at the end of the day it wasn't dating. It was a game. They were playing tinder, and guess what happens after tinder achieved so much success. Exactly. Again, match.com the lovebam off bought them. In other words, most of the dating apps today, a part of the very same group, and this is why we can still say the story doesn't end here after 25 years, the dating app industry is still taking baby steps and this is because it's one of the few businesses where people success is punished instead of rewarded.

Speaker 3:          12:25          Think about it. What would be the best app for dating? Of course, the one that lets you find your significant other, right? Nonetheless, if you find your match on tinder, the next thing you'll do is leave the APP. This way the company stops making money, which is crazy. In other words, the incentive for a dating app is quite broken. If they can help you find your true love, then you're off never to return.

Speaker 2:          12:47          In economic terms, this means the dating app market is far from mature. There's still a lot of space for new players.

Speaker 3:          12:57          For example, one of the tinder craze has left the company after a sexual harassment lawsuit. She created her own app called the bumble. This APP is completely innovative because here women are the ones who must send the first message.

Speaker 1:          13:10          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:12          And of course there's also facebook. Yep. You heard me right? Facebook has already announced they would have launched their own dating site. They have the information that Melville users and the money to make a 180 degree shift to an industry that despite having millions of users, makes them less than $5 billion a year.

Speaker 1:          13:33          Wow.

Speaker 2:          13:33          So now it's your turn. Do you think facebook will be a rival for tinder or match.com do you think online dating will become the preferred way of finding your significant other? Well, please leave your answer in the comment section below.
