Speaker 1:          00:07          Would you used to be considered the safest country in South America and at the same time, the second poorest, but now it seems like things have changing. You see, Nicaragua is a country full of contradictions. It's President Daniel Ortega likes to brag about his deep Marxist Leninist reaps man's. Yet he defines himself as a Catholic and just even banned abortion in

Speaker 2:          00:28          country. Nonetheless,

Speaker 1:          00:33          spine. That facade of moral rectitude doesn't man facing an open trial for abusing his stepdaughter. Displaying this Daniel Tiger's known as a big time family man. In fact, you know the Nicaraguan vice president is. Well, that would be as wife Rae Sarria Maria. Yeah. Right now you're thinking Ms Dot Ortega. Probably not the kind of guy you want to have as a president. Rice. Well, before you start judging too harshly. Here's the other side of that coin. He's been in power since 2007 with a popular support rating. Higher than sixty cents and even we have to admit, but when it comes to foreign relations, he's a genius. Are You A. is one of the few countries that has ties with Iran, Russia, Venezuela. At the same time, the United States of America, yes, you heard that rise. Many of his comrades in the Sandinista Front, his political party accused him of selling his soul to capitalism and that only entirely wrong here or there in Nicaragua is a poor country. It's also one of the most stable economies in the region with an average GDP growth rates of four point six percent. The population living below the poverty line is getting smaller and smaller year.

Speaker 2:          01:48          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:52          well, just look at the immigration statistics and you'll see an exodus of Guatemalans and Mexicans moving to the USA. The Nicaraguans citizens seem to be comfortable staying in the home country. Apparently that satisfied

Speaker 3:          02:05          fight with the political situation, or at least they used to be. The final straw came with pension reform. The government has reduced the amount of money that tired people get, and at the same time has increased what workers have to pay into the system. As you can imagine, nobody liked this policy. Now that the businessmen, northern workers, and this is how the biggest demonstration against Daniel Ortega's machine started, they've tried to oppress these protests with police brutality and massive and prison. Since many people have already lost their lives, even the government has said or owned sympathizers to confront the protesters.

Speaker 1:          02:41          So far, none of these messages have stopped the demonstrations. So now the question becomes, why is all of this happening now when Nicaragua has no economic crisis whatsoever? Are we witnessing the end of Daniel Tiger's rule? Oh, we about to see the end of the Sandinista, Nicaragua. Well, today we aren't going to answer all of these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history on Disney star. Yeah, I know. The title of this section is going to ring a bell for many of you. If you were alive during the 90 days, you might have heard of the Sandinista album from the British punk bands. The clash, the truth is during the eighties, Nicaragua, it became a symbol of the struggle against American imperial. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:27          that's fine.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Exam, the Sandinista friends, it made its way to power off often decades of a far right wing dictatorship. If I tell you that the Sandinista front defines itself as a Marxist, Leninist, anti American political policy, you won't be surprised, but here's the funny boss. They combine all of that ideology with religion. Have you ever heard of liberation theology? What it was in movement within the Catholic Church, especially among Latin American Roman Catholics and his followers were die hard supporters of the Sandinista comrades there some message of genuine Christian anymore than you see on the screen now. That is Daniel Ortega. Back then, he was already the leader of the Sandinista fronts and the presidents of Nicaragua, as you can imagine, in the middle of the Cold War America. I wasn't about to let this country fall under communist rule without a fight. That's why then American president, Ronald Reagan organized one of the most controversial decisions in American history. For one, he sold his weapons to the ISR elders in Iran who were fighting Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Of course, this was a top secret deal because Iran was officially an enemy of the United States. After that, he took all the money from the sales to finance the so called Contrera in Nicaragua. The concert were a far right wing terrorist group that fought against the governments of Daniel Ortega.

Speaker 4:          04:53          I'm speaking of Nicaraguan, a Soviet era on the American mainland only two hours flying time from our own borders or our own security. The United States must deny the Soviet Union a beachhead in North America.

Speaker 1:          05:06          As you can imagine, when the story got leaks, the media went pretty crazy and so did the world of music. That's why we have so many songs and records from those times from the clash to Kris Kristofferson. Now, you might be wondering, what did Daniel Ortega do while he was empowered? Will? In a way, you could see that he set a precedent for Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela. In short, the Sandinista government nationalized all of the companies that were in the hands of the local oligarchs, and how did they pay for all of that? Well, they did that by getting more and more loans from the Soviet Union and of course printing money like there was no tomorrow, and what was the outcome of all of this? Well, in the year 1986 soft, a little more than five years under our tag is rural Nicaragua with suffering from one of the worst cases of hyperinflation of all time, the bitterest of the conflict

Speaker 3:          05:58          between the countries. Former Sunday nice to leaders and American backed rebels'. All Nicaraguans shared one crucial piece of common ground, the reliance on the American dollar.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Just imagine that the value of the local currency, the Cordoba would value every 15 days. This means that if you bought a beer one day and paid, say 10 goal date is yet to come back four months later, and the same beer would be over 3000. Now we've told you many times here on visual policy that the worst thing that can happen to a country is hyperinflation. This is why despite the fact that Daniel Ortega have so much support to citizens, showed him that backs.

Speaker 3:          06:33          This is why in the year 1990 Nicaragua had a new currency, the Golden Cordoba, at a different government this time of conservative one during the nineties, Daniel Ortega was the leader of the opposition party. Meanwhile, the country was getting rid of that hyperinflation and it was coming back to the situation of stable pop.

Speaker 2:          06:52          No

Speaker 3:          06:53          Nicaraguans kept being poor, but at least they didn't have big surprises. The purchasing power wouldn't diminish because there's not so much inflation and there were no more wars or terrorist attacks

Speaker 1:          07:06          and this is how we get to the year 2006 the year. When Nicaragua Hell's new elections and not civil, look at what happens

Speaker 3:          07:19          to Ortegas

Speaker 1:          07:20          in 2006, so we'll take a [inaudible] to the governments, but this time he was a different version of himself. Of course, he was still a member of the Sandinista fronts, but so many years as the opposition helped reshape his ideas,

Speaker 3:          07:35          neil or take a no longer supports Marxist Leninism and is now a supporter of Ortega. That is the problem. Testimonial from a Sunday to supporter.

Speaker 1:          07:44          Of course, this brand new version of Daniel Ortega still sticks to the same old socialist rhetoric is government guarantees, universal access to healthcare and education in facts, but if the literacy rates and average life expectancy have increased in the country, but that rush for nationalization has given way to more moderate discourse,

Speaker 5:          08:03          look over there. Look,

Speaker 3:          08:11          white collar workers, blue collar workers, farmers, producers, entrepreneurs, small businessmen, and big businessmen, all the economic and social powers of the country. Let's work together.

Speaker 5:          08:23          Oh No.

Speaker 1:          08:24          Oh, wait a minute. Hand because does even more. Thirty years ago, Nicaragua was the guy that the US love to hate, but now they've signed a free trade with America. The so called Captain Mans, they celebrate with counselor Naco operations. Bear in mind that the American agriculture market is protected, but chocolate coffee and bananas from Nicaragua as the exception to that rule, they find it way easier to get into those American mark. This still isn't the end of our story. Do you remember about special economic zones? I've told you about them in a video before basically that an area inside of a developing country with lower taxes and more business friendly rules. Well, Nicaragua has got one. The images you're beginning to see on the screen now, they belong to an ad made by the government to attract foreign investors.

Speaker 6:          09:12          If someone was thinking of investing in it broadwell, I would encourage her to come down and I think they'll find the same advantages that we found nod with close to the US, a frog bilingual population availability of, of highly educated workforce.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Surprisingly, it seems this insole. Tiger came to power. Nicaragua has been flooded with new call centers from international companies. She played a special taxes and most importantly of all the opportunity to do business in the only country with new street violence or guerrillas whatsoever. So now you might be wondering what happened to Daniel Ortega? Did he have, if any? Well, of course not. He just learns that when it comes through, he does well under your rule. It's easier to stay in power. This is why in election after election or Tavi gets more than 60 percent of the vote. Of course these elections are rigged, but only a fool would say the total Tayga has no popular support. In fact, there's also another reason for this ideological change. See if the economy of your country is doing or rice and you control every facet of your country, your personal finances at giving to the procedure. Dawn, great.

Speaker 3:          10:19          The precedent Daniel Ortega has put his wife and sons and important government positions while his family has gotten rich. Thanks for Venezuelan oil.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Meanwhile, there's government has invested a good share of that money in avoiding school rivalries. Eventually, every media station in Nicaragua is owned by the governments or some businessmen that's connected to Daniel Ortega, and by the way, there's a new social media law which started to be discussed in March of 2018, and this would allow the ruling class to censor and chase political activists. Nonetheless, protests have started for a totally different reason. That's how I look at that.

Speaker 3:          10:55          Why do they protest? In Nicaragua,

Speaker 1:          10:57          common wisdom says that revolutions happen when it comes free. Isn't a big crisis rice? Well, that's actually a big mistake. In fact, revolutions happened when a country was going through dire straights, but is now starting to go,

Speaker 2:          11:10          right?

Speaker 1:          11:12          Implying is this. Well, basically if nobody around you is driving a cadillac, then they're all cadillacs to be jealous about. You can probably see where I'm going with this. All of a sudden, Nicaraguan saw witnessing the advent of a brand's knew at least the friends of Daniel Ortega. Yes, it is true. The whole country is growing, but some long growing faster than others and only the most naive believed that this new aristocracy got rich entirely on their own merits. This is what we call the populist moment, so window of opportunity where the governments can change. This is like filling a room with gas. You just need flick of a lighter and everything explodes.

Speaker 2:          11:56          Contract Marshall,

Speaker 1:          11:57          I n s, s law has already passed. In summary, the government has decided to lower pension swell, increasing contributions. Businessmen, workers and students have taken to the streets like that. Spent years waiting for the opportunity. Thousands of people protesting and the government's. The government doesn't know how to react. This is why they have forced all the Nicaraguan TV stations to stop broadcasting the demonstrations. Despite all of this protests being organized all over the country, not only in the capital, even in its smallest villages in facts, we know about this because we've saved thousands of messages from protestors. As you probably know, visual politics also got a Spanish language version and those he watched that channel from Nicaragua. I've sent hundreds of videos from universities in these videos. You can see that students, they've been sitting there for days, people bringing them food and water, but then a policeman will come and take it away and we have plenty of images of police brutality. We're not going to show here, but trust us when we say that the Nicaraguan police, they're doing everything they can to repress these protests. It's big time clash forces in what used to be the most peaceful country in South Korea.

Speaker 2:          13:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:15          Now the question you might ask is, is this the end of Daniel Ortega's role? And as we always say here, visual politic, you can never make accurate predictions when it comes to politics and economics. Having almost a protest as doesn't really mean anything. In fact, we still don't know if all these political activists serve a common cause or a common leader. According to the messages we get some liberal factions as well as some die hard Sandinista people who feel the trade by Mr Ortega's ideological shift. As you can imagine, things like special economic zones, not very Marxist Leninist. In other words, so far, there isn't much organization and there's no real leader that can capitalize on all this popular unrest with. Now this is hard to offer. A real alternative to the official. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          14:01          power.

Speaker 1:          14:06          That's our opinion. Here are visual politic. Now we'd like to know yours. What do you think is going to happen? Do you really think Daniel Ortega will have to step down from power or will we see many more years of Sandy aneurysm?
