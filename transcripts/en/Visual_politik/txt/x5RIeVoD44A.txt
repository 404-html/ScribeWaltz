Speaker 1:          00:07          Nice to economics, what Axel rose is to the music industry, rocks in the late eighties and the beginning of the nineties. Then they started losing grounds and nowadays anytime they try to make a comeback, the results are pretty disappointing.

Speaker 1:          00:29          I know you're thinking of first glance. Japan doesn't seem to be that bad, right? I mean they have the video games, the enemy movies and world class tech Bam offs and cameras or Tokyo that looks like a city. It's the world's biggest metropolis with over $30 million people. Then they have the fastest trains, the most modern tvs and even human like robots. Nonetheless, this country has gone through two decades without any economic growth and I saw the worst of us. Japan is the most indebted country in the world because they are more than twice their entire GDP and the population is increasing faster than anywhere else. Which poses a big problem when it comes to paying for retirement pensions. This is one of the reasons why Japanese workers have crazy hours and almost no vacation time and those good old technological juggernauts like a touch or panasonic or falling behind the more modern companies from China and America. Hold on a second because things, they might be on the verge of change. Yes. I'm talking here about the Tokyo Olympics. Do you take place in 20, 20? It's an opportunity to showcase their entire country and get the world's attention. Yes. Did you ever since Japan won the Olympic bid in 2013, tourism has absolutely skyrocketed

Speaker 2:          01:57          and the same goes with private investment. By the year 20, 20 Tokyo will have 45 brand new skyscraper. Nice. Like Panasonic will set state of the art solar cells in increasing location so people can charge their electric cars anywhere and if this wasn't enough, Sony will launch their brand new eight k TV screens.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Yes. You had that right? Soon enough. We are going to have eight cases. You can see every microfiber of the athletes shirts, but hold on for just a second ed, because not everything is so beautiful. You see, when Tokyo won the Olympic bid, they had budgeted six point 5 billion American dollars, but since they started building, the costs have doubled and they haven't even finished. Yes. In fact, Tokyo City Hall has predicted that the total cost might be up to around 20 billion USD, so the question is on the Olympic Games, actually an opportunity for Japan, or quite the opposite, are the Olympic Games as good for a country's, as people say, well, today we are going to answer these questions, but as we always do, let's take a look. First back at the history Olympic fallacy. Very few things spark national pride quite as much as the Olympic Games. Of course, we all like to brag about the gold medals on country has less water really inflames patriotism the most. It's becoming an Olympic host. The excitement, it generates this so big that everyone, regardless of their ideology, seems to think that organizing an event for this length, the country is a good thing, but from an economic standpoint, things up. Not that clear. In fact, the arguments in favor of hosting the Olympic Games are a little bit like, how should we say? Well, there is inconsistent as a tweet, Donald Trump, according to a paper from the Bank of Japan, the effects of the Olympics are so positive that they can be filled even before the Olympics takes place.

Speaker 1:          04:02          More specifically the same year, the International Olympic Committee name Tokyo as the host city. Many started to see Japan as the perfect place for investment. Remember that we're talking about a paper from an institution as prestigious as the Bank of Japan. This is basically the Japanese equivalent to the American Federal Reserve. That said, one of their main arguments is that if your city gets to the common Olympic host, the whole country can join all those big organizations that every country wants to be a member of. So how about an example? Well, Barcelona got the nomination in 1986. Some theme that very same. Yes. Spain joined the EU. Beijing was nominated in 2001 and then again they joined the World Trade Organization that very year. It seems like this line of reasoning is pretty bulletproof, but just hold on a second because this is a textbook example of something called correlation fallacy. In other words, the fact that Spain joined the EU the same year the Barcelona got chosen as the Olympic host does not mean that the one thing caused the other. In fact, Portugal also joined the EU in the same year and they didn't post anything

Speaker 1:          05:07          and the same will happen with China. At the same time, other Asian countries joined the WTO without organizing benny sporting events. Now, just hold on a second. He's like, probably know what you're thinking right about now when you're probably thinking, well, Hey Simon, well, what about other international attention that the Olympic Games can bring? I mean for two whole weeks the whole world is going to have their eyes on Japan. That's got to be a good thing. Rice, I mean, we're talking about the biggest sporting event in the world. Well, maybe not. Once you see the London Olympics in 2012, I got a pretty average audience. I mean around 31 million Americans. To you,

Speaker 3:          05:43          it's

Speaker 1:          05:43          making comparison. This is twice as much as an episode of game of thrones and that wasn't exactly being regarded as bas, but well, what about the rest of the Games now? The Olympics in 2014 didn't even have 22 million viewers in the United States in Rio. 20 16. I was just 26 million, so now these numbers might look quite big to you right now, but it's really nothing if we compare it to a much cheaper events like the super bowl.

Speaker 3:          06:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:10          The 2016 superbowl surpassed a hundred and 10 million viewers. In other words, even though the Olympics or watched all around the world, when you look at the audience, country by country, the figures aren't really that impressive and this means that the perception people have about that country doesn't really change. The state doesn't really seem to change for the good.

Speaker 2:          06:31          A study of the impact of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Australian researchers interviewed people one year before and after the games they found a little change in perceptions with one surprising wrinkle. South Africans were displeased with Australia because of the way in which the aboriginal issue was highlighted and portrayed by the South African.

Speaker 1:          06:58          Nonetheless, there is one thing that it seems fair to agree on Olympic Games do. Kickstart your tourism industry. Actually, since Tokyo was chosen as the Olympic coast tourism in Japan has absolutely skyrocketed. I mean they almost didn't have any tourists since 2013, but last year they support 24 million people. You could say essentially a brand new industry. It's just been born in Japan and tourism. Tourism is an industry that attracts a lot of foreign money and our money. I mean, got to be a good thing. Right. Well, I can't just hold on a minute because even these figures that are up for debate, of course tourism in Japan, it's increased a lot, but do you know of some other countries that also have a booming tourist section right now? Well, shelley and Thailand are great examples. They have grown at a similar rate to Japan and don't even Google it because I'm going to tell you right now, neither of these countries is planning to host the Olympic Games anytime soon.

Speaker 1:          07:55          Did Thailand's example is pretty paradigmatic. They get 6 million more tourists than Japan each year and they have just popped population and their tourism. Grief is directly correlated to that of the Chinese middle class. In other words, as Chinese people have more money, they want to do more sightseeing and well, where do they go? Well, they go to countries that are nearby and it's a beautiful things to see. All right. All right, so now you might be thinking, well, even if the Olympics aren't as profitable as they seem, well, what's the problem? If Tokyo wants to host the Olympics, I mean he doesn't like having a giant stadium in his city. Well, that's inclusive. Look at that one too.

Speaker 2:          08:36          Medalists in spending.

Speaker 1:          08:39          Now we all know that the Olympics are costly from one day to the next. Okay. Basically went from not having to have an Olympic stadiums, so having to have one which has to hold more than 80,000 people and also, I mean they have to impress everyone with lights and colors and all sorts of fancy things, but it doesn't stop there. I mean they also need other special venues for the mini competitions that are held at the same time. Each of the sports has its own specifications in total. Thirty one venues will need to be built or remodels for the Tokyo 20, 20 summer Olympic Games.

Speaker 3:          09:09          Yes.

Speaker 1:          09:13          And then there's a media center and other giant white elephants ends on top of that. There's the Olympic villa. The Olympic villa is basically nothing short of a small town where 10,000 athletes are going to live during the Olympics and as you can probably imagine, this is certainly not going to be cheap. Now remember at the total cost for this, we're supposed to be at six point 5 billion USD. At least this was the figure given by the local authorities to the International Olympic Committee in 2013. But as you know, theories are one thing and reality is something completely different.

Speaker 2:          09:46          Pure 20, 20 Olympic Games costs just keep rising.

Speaker 1:          09:50          By December 2017, Tokyo City Hall had already spent over $12,000,000,000 and just a couple of months later the local authorities report is that they would end up spending a whopping figure of at least $20,000,000,000 and is even possible that this figure will keep rising before they even begin to burn the Olympic flame. But I mean none of this is really a surprise

Speaker 2:          10:13          since he can remember every Olympic game has had significant cost overruns. Rio De Janeiro, 2016 ended up costing 51 percent more than expected. But the record so far is Montreal. Nineteen 76, which costs 700 percent more than was initially budgeted. You heard that right? Eight times more than what was first planned. All right, so now you might be wondering, well, how these

Speaker 1:          10:40          billions of dollars really all that much money for a big governments and you compared with normal spending in a big city whole, is that actually a lot of money? Well, the answer to that is an absolutely resounding yes for better understanding with $20 million US dollars, you could build a highway that connected the extreme north of Japan to the extreme south and that really isn't even the worst of it. You see an apple for a highway. It can ends up being a waste of money, but still you can always reutilize this. A country with best, better infrastructure and communication can have better companies in the future. Brand new industries, a better public services. What do you get with an Olympic stadium? The Coin Heist? 80,000 people. Well, if we look at past examples of the answer to that question, it's pretty bleak.

Speaker 2:          11:29          Olympic venues already falling into a state of disrepair.

Speaker 1:          11:34          The Rio de Janeiro example is particularly harsh. Despite hosting the Olympics. They still have entire neighborhoods that aren't even connected to the city center by a bus line and the place where the Olympic villa was. Well, that's becoming a slum and this is not the only example.

Speaker 2:          11:52          Athens Olympic in ruins 10 years on from the 2004 games.

Speaker 3:          11:56          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:58          and then you've got to add to all of this that Japan is the most indebted country on the planet. They owe us some equivalent to 130 percent of their GDP to government is already struggling to pay retirement pensions and they've already been two years without any economic growth whatsoever,

Speaker 1:          12:16          but now I would say what to you? Do you think that the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 will mean the ruin of Japan or maybe against the odds?
