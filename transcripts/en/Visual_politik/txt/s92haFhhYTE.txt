Speaker 1:          00:07          Right, lights, slot machines, poker, blackjack, all of all mine, so probably interests traveled to London,

Speaker 2:          00:12          Vegas,

Speaker 1:          00:17          sin. It's the place that everyone thinks of when they think of gambling as well. That's because it's the world's capital of gambling, right? Well, actually it is not because the world's leading capital of gambling is by no means Las Vegas. It's Macau. Macau is an autonomous city located in the south of China, very close to Hong Kong. In fact, it's so close to Hong Kong, but the fastest way to get to Macau from Hong Kong is by a fast ferry. It takes about an hour. Macau is a very curious city. On the one hand, it's a small slice of Portugal inside the very chaotic Asian southwest. On the other hand, it's place where skyscrapers and bowls, modern architecture of very easy to do

Speaker 2:          01:01          fine

Speaker 1:          01:03          landscape is dominated by an enormous skyscraper skyscraper with colorful crystals in the sheep of Lotus flowers. This building is the Grand Lisboa. Above all, the Macau is something of a messy city. It's all rather ramshackle and full of tiny little street

Speaker 1:          01:24          was the last colonial European city in Asia and it remained a colonial city until very recent times for centuries. It was a part of Portugal that was until the end of 1999 when it was finally integrated with China. At this point it was set up in China as a special administrative region. This essentially allows for the one country, but two systems set up these two cities, Macau and Hong Kong, even though they are a part of China, keep their own legislation with certain limitations and they also have their own customs caught currency and political institutions. In practical terms, they really work as if they are a different country from China. Interestingly in Macau, Portuguese is still an official language

Speaker 2:          02:03          which normally an issue. Ilene with Zoe and we will give the MCO.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Well really mcconnell could be more considered a gambling theme part rather than a city. Every year Macau receives over 30 million tourists. This makes this tiny piece of land is one of the most visited places in the world. So why is this? You might be asking. Well, that's because it's the only place in the whole of China where gambling is permitted.

Speaker 2:          02:37          Thanks this,

Speaker 1:          02:37          since there's integration with China or up until 2014, the region has enjoyed one of the fastest periods of economic growth in history. In a little over 10 years, GDP has multiplied by 10 going from $5,000,000,000 to 55 billion. Now. There was a very key moments in this growth phase and that was when mccowen gave the gambling free reign. It was at this very moment so that huge multinational gambling companies moved in to establish themselves in Macau and this changed the identity forever. There's something about the Asian culture where gaming is acceptable as a form of entertainment and so that is a major driver of the success I think that you've seen here and clearly in Singapore today. The city is known as Chinese last Vegas for its high concentration of casinos at dear view is about is something of a ridiculous name because gambling in Macau is a way, way bigger deal than in Las Vegas. In the cows. Forty plus casinos in 2015. Over $29,000,000,000 was invoiced, which for some perspective is five times that of last year,

Speaker 2:          03:41          Vegas

Speaker 1:          03:43          in 2013, it reached the astonishing amount of $45,000,000,000, which for a comparison is almost the same as the entire amounts of money that franz receives from its entire tourism industry. It really is pretty amazing gambling lights. Luxury shops, sends well still more lights. That is Macau's, new identity.

Speaker 2:          04:06          My cows casinos

Speaker 1:          04:09          now on every time you think of gambling, do not think of a Monte Carlo or Las Vegas, but do think of Macau and there is absolutely no slowing down. Three new mega casinos. The result of multimillion dollar investments that have opened in the last 12 months. For example, at the end of 2015, these studio city development opens. This is a huge hotel casino complex with a Hollywood atmosphere. Interestingly, it's opening saw the production of a short 15 minute film which had a production budget of $70 million dollars, which is a record by the way. The film was directed by Martin Scorsese and had lead roles played by Robert De Niro, Leonardo Dicaprio, and Brad Pitt, which leaves us wondering what possible hotel opening good editorial.

Speaker 2:          04:57          This part,

Speaker 1:          05:05          Lee, in August 2016, the wind palace opened its doors. This is a luxurious hotel with 1,700 Greens, which cost about four point 2 billion USD. You just hotel to open. At the time of writing was the Parisians. This is a masterpiece created bind for last Vegas Sands Company, which is owned by wealthy invest. If Sheldon Adelson.

Speaker 2:          05:31          This

Speaker 1:          05:32          hotel is essentially a city in itself with free thousand rooms, a waterpark and even its own half scare life for

Speaker 2:          05:39          tower.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Oh yes. The openings do continue. The next opening is going to be the 13, which is billed as the most expensive hotel in the world. Some of the rooms in this hotel are going to cost between 50 and a hundred thousand dollars night and know that is not a mistake. On the plus side, guests are going to have the use of 30 rolls royces burst at the cost of 50 to $100,000 a night. They should probably be be giving you a Rolls Royce along with these new hotels. Casinos, some of the most legendary in Macau currently are the Galaxy Grand Lisboa, the city of dreams, the Venetian, the mgm, as well as many more. If Mcconnell keeps this up, the Strip in Las Vegas is soon going to look like the work of an amateur

Speaker 3:          06:25          profit sharing in the cow more than yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:29          80 percent of governmental income comes from these casinos ends. The money is so abundant that every year Macau has a significant budget. Surplus Mcconnell is completely unfamiliar with the idea of a deficit, and as you can probably imagine from this, taxes are rather low. So now you might be wondering what exactly does the government do with such a huge surplus every year? Well, a part of it is invested in infrastructure, but an entire third of it is wait for it paid to Macau Macau's citizens as a dividend. Yes. Again, we are not making a mistake here since 2008, all of the city's inhabitants have received a portion of the income from the casinos. For example, in 2016, the dividend was a thousand dollars per citizen. This means that for a family of four, they are getting a check for $4,000 every single year, which isn't exactly bad and this is not the only benefit that the citizens get from the casinos. Every one in four jobs in Macau is in the casino industry, so low taxes, high employment rates, and dividends paid out from the casinos. It all seems like a pretty sweet deal. However, not everything is sunshine and rainbows and yeah,

Speaker 3:          07:35          lollipops, crises in Macau, most tourists,

Speaker 1:          07:41          Macau, around two thirds coming from continental China. This means that the economy over the region is highly dependent on China's, and if that wasn't enough, she shipping the president of China, started a war against public work at corruption in 2015. After that time, the economy of Macau collapsed.

Speaker 3:          07:58          Chinese President Xi Jinping has been cleaning house on the mainland, including cracking down on those. Trying to take money out of the country illegally and that's making some high rollers. Very wary about spending big in Macau

Speaker 1:          08:11          in a single year. The gambling income over the city fell by 40 percent. This led to the economy of Macau losing more than 20 percent of its GDP. The corrupts public workers in China had gotten use to the idea of going to Macau. They could easily spend their money, do some gambling, attended red carpet like events and while they're there, probably do some laundry.

Speaker 3:          08:30          Have the money for it generally, and I decided there will be no investigation. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go away

Speaker 1:          08:36          now. It's not as if the whole industry depends on them, but as in the Chinese economic slow down and to the new controls established by the Chinese government as many of these vip so you used to go to Macau, have simply stopped doing so. Now this is going to continue for a little while at least, and it's causing problems from the cow because half of their economy relies on thanks to numerous investments, a good state of public finance, and is the advantage of being such an important tourist cluster. These social and economic effects have been limited, so the government's keeps a comfortable surplus. The unemployment rate is one point eight percent and his family incomes have not suffered violence. One thing is absolutely true. As Xi Jinping said on his last visit to the city, it is time for diversification and the governments has already presented a plan to tackle

Speaker 2:          09:20          Columbus

Speaker 1:          09:25          based on family tourism, health, tourism, finance, and the technological industry. In the next few years, the economy has already started to bounce back. If the government's plans do become a reality, Macau might become some sort of 21st century Monaco in the next few years. The city's mistake was to put all of its eggs in one basket and not diversifying. They didn't make it easy for companies to form and they didn't make it easy for outside investors to come in. This is something that also happened in Atlantic city with serious consequences, but that's something we're going to be looking at in a future video. So what do you think about Macau?
