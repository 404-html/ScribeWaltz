Speaker 1:          00:07          Here's the question, anyone had a faker, sk telecom fans? Well, those over 30 the slightest clue what I'm talking about. I'm talking about some of the most famous players after the eeg of legends, League of legends, also known as lol, due to its initials, is one of the most successful video games in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:29          How'd that rise? Many may think the video games aren't simply a domestic form of entertainment with either game we'd play as is home alone or with our friends and that's pretty much it writes well, Dev view out nothing could be further from the truth. The surgeon will open its first use sports stadium in Los Angeles next month. Yup. That is really something that's happening nowadays. Video Games have become a mass sport almost on the same level as football or formula one, giving you an idea only in 2017. East sports that is electronic sports moved more than one point $5,000,000,000 through sponsorships, merchandising and investment. Yeah. Now that is still a little compared to the $8,000,000,000. The Formula One moves, for example, but it isn't bad if we consider that this new mass sport isn't even 10 years old. To give you an idea, the first league of Legends World Championship was held in 2011 and had an audience of about $200,000. Seven years later, in 2016, more than 14 million people from around the world saw the final match. These figures are only a little bit lower than the ones we could find for an NBA final, but not much lower. Now, league of legends broadcast even have their own commentators in various languages. Where do you think sports are the most popular? Of course that would be an Asia. In countries like China or South Korea, their accounts for more than 60 percent of video games audience, unlike Formula One, which never really took hold in this part of the world. East sports have really stuck and logically this has led to an uproar in the investor as well.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Intel, HP announced record investment e-sports industry. However, the Internet and new technologies have always been the perfect breeding grounds for generating financial bubbles that explode in a rather big way. We've all heard about the.com crisis at the beginning of the 21st century or the downtown companies like snapchat took. So the question is, are we really talking about a new sport or is this simply just another bubble kind of massport simply be created from nothing just by investing money? Well, we're going to answer these questions in today's video, but first, let's take a look at the history.

Speaker 2:          02:56          Who invented

Speaker 1:          02:56          Formula One in 2015 group of investors go to liberty media, but what Formula One you might be wondering, well, how can someone buy a sport? Well, the truth is that Formula One, in addition to being a sports competition, is also actually a after the second world war with the cars democratization, a massive public emerged who loved seeing the fastest cars in the world and his car manufacturers. They were happy to participate in these races. Competitions gave them the perfect excuse to test their latest engines. To give you an idea of this formula, one car can cost millions of dollars even though it's never intended for the consumer markets. However, the technology it uses ends up being implemented in utilitarian cars, for example, disc brakes, so active suspension innovations born in formula throughout these years. The only instate in job regulating and stick teasing the competition rules was the international automobile federation, also known as the eye. However, the real business didn't emerge until the seventies when this guy came along. This is Bernie ecclestone something. If the tuner of speed, I Colston was the owner of a Formula One team. He immediately realized that this sport was a money making machine, but the business was neither in the prizes nor in the car companies.

Speaker 1:          04:24          The real money was in selling tv transmission rights around the wells. Now, what do you think Bernie did? Hip well, he partnered with the other teams, went to the IAF headquarters and told them either you give us transmission rights so that we can manage them well. We stopped running and your out of races and that is how what we know today as the Formula One group was born. That is, it's a sport that became the company that is even listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In other words, on the one hand we have the IAF which is in charge of organizing the racism, creating the regulations so that everyone can meet on equal terms. It was on the other hands, the one who really has all the money as the Formula One group, and we're not just talking about a few dollars here and 2011. They made a profit of over one point $5,000,000,000.

Speaker 2:          05:13          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          05:13          And when we talk about billions of dollars, it's. It's easy to get lost in the figures and not really know how much that is worth, but put it this way, the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world could be built with that kind of money. Now, as you can imagine, these two organizations that often fighting and they do have a lot of legal conflicts because they will. Now you might be wondering, well, how does Formula One make any money? Now pay attention here because this is going to help us analyze e-sports, veteran a moments. Most of the money comes from transmission rights and from the payments that municipalities and different governments make to host any of the races in that cities. Those two things alone account for 60 percent of the income. The rest is made with companies sponsorships. That is advertising and merchandise sales and so in other words, the too long didn't read version is yes, the company can create a big sport and make billions of dollars from it, from essentially nothing. Now the question is, can e-sports replicate this business model? Well, let's dive into that right now. Pixels to legends, just like car racing, video game competitions are as old as video games themselves. The first major tournament was held in 1972 at Stanford University.

Speaker 1:          06:24          More than 10,000 people gathered to see the best space wall players. It's baseball. It was one of these old video games with big pixels and eight bit music. In those years. Video Games hardly had multiplayer systems and internet connections that he existed, so in other words, in those times it was very haunting, organize any competition that was really worth seeing. So just as in Formula One came about, when most people started having cars in east sports came when most people started having high speed Internet connections and you might be able to guess the first country where competitions were hell's. Yep, it was South Korea in 2006. South Korea was the country with the fastest Internet on the planet's ended. That time, half of the population had broadband connections. In other words, this was the perfect breeding grounds for the first big halo or starcraft players to emerge. And so how did these plants become famous? Well, that's through streaming platforms such as youtube or above will twitch.tv, and that is essentially how east sports fever broke out in South Korea. Souls getting a new dedicated esports stadium come March 2016. Now. You may be wondering who would be the Bernie ecclestone of eastport and well balanced is riot games.

Speaker 1:          07:45          This is the company that created the most successful game of all time, League of legends, which was released in 2009. We talking about a video game that seems to have been made for competitions. I mean check this out too, that time. Online games where, how do we say it? A bit rudimentary. Of course there were titles like world of warcraft, which had fantastic graphics and a great story, but these were role playing game, which one can play for hours and never win and never lose. Also, you have to pay a monthly fee to pay and not everyone can afford that. However, at League of legends is free, has great graphics and an unbeatable game. Mode and games last for about an hour. They have a winning and losing team in a very short time. This video game gained millions of players around them. They were connected by the Internet. The teams that were created were completely international. For example, at one of the best nine groups known as origin, has Spanish, French and finished plans. The truth is the by the year 2011, they had a critical mass of users and to celebrate it, they went to an industry festival that was being held in Sweden. They had an audience and they place to celebrate the championship, allowing their players to share their screens on youtube or twitch was enough to offer a show on an international scale, and as we always say it, as it was said, so it was

Speaker 2:          09:05          done.

Speaker 1:          09:09          Championship reaches 900,000 viewers. One thing was clear, there was an audience he wanted to watch matches from their favorite game on that computer screens from the initial 900,000 spectators, we now have surpassed more than 14 million and the players who are now professionals travel around the wells on athlete visas. This means that from the institutional point of view, League of legends is now considered a rightful sport and swear there's an audience. There are also companies willing to pay for publicity. Don't forget, we're talking about video games. Yeah, a perfect environment to sell computers, graphics, cards, screens, or even high speed Internet connection. It's every technology company has recently decided to sponsor events. As you can imagine, that's where the gains come from as there are also huge investors willing to invest in this industry. It's investment research highlights three east stocks to watch. It's clear east sports or a business that is growing by leaps and bounds, but how far can it go? Good. We'd be talking about the new Formula One. Well, if you remember, we mentioned that most of Formula One's income comes from the rights sold to TV network to now he's some broadcast openly, freely through online streaming platforms. Therefore, there doesn't seem to be a big television business here. As on the other hand, so far, new governments or municipalities have seemed willing to pay to host a tournament. In other words, for me to one has a diversified business with different income streams, which means that even in times of crisis, the company continues to make an income.

Speaker 1:          10:56          At the moment it seems that the bulk of esports income depends largely on their sponsors and by definition sponsor based businesses are on stable, but above all, the biggest problem with this type of sports is variety. There's only one formula one does that mean one football, but there are lots of esports and we don't know which ones were lost and which ones worked. League of legends has achieved and undeniable amounts of success, but it was created in 2009. I mean, will it still be fashionable in another 10 years or will a new electronic sports emerge that will pick up

Speaker 2:          11:27          that awesome.

Speaker 1:          11:34          No mistake. The sports, they're here to stay. The question is which one is worth investing in in the long run? Of course, these are all reasonable doubts for any new industry and uncertain. No circumstances do we want to underestimate this phenomenon. That's as we always say, a visual politic. Not Everything is as it seems and the devil, whether it's in the detail. Having said that, I'll leave you with this question. Would you invest in an sports company right now? Do you think we're facing a new mass sport that will generate millions of dollars swelled and leave your onset in the comments below, and if you want to know more about another emerging economic industry in this case that have electric cars, we tell you about that in this other video where we look at the competition between Tesla and BMW.
