Speaker 1:          00:08          We already told you here on visual politic, even though it is unusual to hear about this, the truth is that in recent years, some things have begun to change in Africa. The year 2000, half of the fastest growing economies on the planet have actually been located on this continent according to the international monetary funds forecasts in 2018. Six. Yeah, six of the 10 economies with the highest growth rates will be African countries like Tanzania, Ethiopia in the Ivory Coast or at the head of the race. In terms of global growth. Now, Africa is a huge continent. It's made up of 54 individual countries, so we can find all sorts of situations here. Countries that grow a lot and countries that grow well less, but there's a case that stands out above all of them and not precisely because things are going well. Yes, of course. I'm talking about South Africa or a country. That was the great African hope for a really long time. Well, Dvu at the truth is that Nelson Mandela's dream of a free and prosperous South Africa. It's become something of a nightmare. In recent years, things have gone really wrong, growth, Spanish, racial problems of returns in corruption has spread throughout the country.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Congress is actually talking about expropriating, the glands of white people without any compensation. However, in February the government changed and one of the richest men in Africa became the new presidents. So could South Africa get back on the right path or are we facing another great African disappointments? In this video, we also want to look at what caused those good years to ends and if the white population in the country faces any risk, so let's get on with it. South African disappointment. South Africa is a huge country. It's about the size of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium all combined together and it represents about a quarter of all of Subsaharan. Africa is GDP well after the ends of a pore size and after the democratic transition that began in 1994. South Africa experienced a particular golden age between 1998 and 2008. The economy grew steadily. This allowed the black middle class to double and essential services such as running water reached to most of the

Speaker 2:          02:50          relations

Speaker 1:          02:54          with a big economy, a vibrant democracy, a free press, and lots of civic organizations seems ready for South Africa to make the leap that would allow its people and not just white people to live the comfortable lives of citizens of a developed country. In other words, South Africa was expected to become a role model for the entire African continent. My hold on a moment here because things don't always turn out quite as expected and in 2009, this entire process ended. Since then, things have just gone from bad to worse. Economy isn't growing. Unemployment has risen to almost 40 percent. Poverty has picked up again and public accounts are absolutely shattered and that's not all the latest government measures that the government is announced and the current social tensions have even caused. Announcements like this

Speaker 3:          03:48          last March, 2018 Australian Minister of internal affairs, Peter Dutton publicly announced that his country would consider granting a special emergency visa and refuge to the South African white population that felt unsafe in their own country.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Now, hold on just a moment here because we're talking about an Australian minister here talking about sheltering white South Africans. I mean all things really that bad. Wasn't this the country of harmony and reconciliation? Well, you heard what that minister had to say, but at this point in the question really still remains. What the hell went wrong? Well, we already have our culprits. We talked about him before. By the way, in a video that I will link to in the description. Do you know who he is? Well, listen. Okay. Jacob Zuma, ninth of May, 2009, Jacob Zuma became the president of South Africa. Just launched his controversial record, which included accusations of rape, corruption, and even organized crime. Zuma managed to reach power thanks to the support of the popular classes who felt that he was one of their own. After all, we're talking about one of the most prominent leaders of the anti apartheid movement and leader for 10 years was in prison with Nelson Mandela himself, the father of the current South African nation, and this well. It gave him a great deal of credibility. Worldview. Jacob Zuma, who opened the practices polygamy and is estimated to have at least 20 children, was forced to resign and leave through the back door on February the 14th, 2018.

Speaker 2:          05:19          See,

Speaker 1:          05:21          I mean, check this out. He was repudiated by his own party, the powerful African National Congress cornered by the opposition who threatened him with a motion of censure. He simply had no other alternative. You had to leave one way or another for the almost nine years that Zuma was empower. Life in South Africa was a nightmare.

Speaker 1:          05:39          You see zoom that came to power with the promise of a more prosperous country and more opportunities for the poorest, but instead it's. Well, what do you think he did? Yup. Nothing less than turning these South African governments into a kind of mine, a business that's simply served him and is in a circle. By the way, do you know what the first thing he did after named president was? Well, he spent $23,000,000 from the state budget to improve his private residence. That's what we mean pulled here or an empathy that he even had a cow barn and a chicken coop built,

Speaker 1:          06:13          but of course that's not all. On March, the 16th national prosecutors announced that they would present challenges against Jacob Zuma for a multimillion dollar purchase agreements of weapons ships, submarines, and fighter jets with European companies that South Africa signs in the 19 nineties. For this time, Zuma was Nelson Mandela's deputy presidents. This weapons purchase cost over $3,000,000,000 and the stated goal was improving national security. The real goal though was enriching. Guys like Jacob Zuma, the arms deal was the most graphic loss of innocence of post apartheid South Africa and it Persado the corruption we're seeing today. David Lewis, executive director of corruption. Watch a nonprofit organization based in your hand is Berg, and this is just one case. Dozens and dozens of more cases are lined up for Zima, so in short, yes, he was a really, really greedy dude. In total is estimated that Jacob Zuma is corruption and the corruption of his inner circle have cost the public coffers more than 4 million American dollars, or if you think that is the West thing, well you all very, very wrong. The worst part is that he got the cancer that is corruption to spread massively through the country. Listen up here, cancer

Speaker 1:          07:34          thing was always clear that Jacob Zuma, and he even said it openly, his party, the national African Congress, was more important than the very South African nation that had been elected to serve and what better way to put the party in the forefront then by enriching it's leaders with public resources and that's precisely what he did have since Zuma came to power. Corruption has multiplied. State services are a mess, and some math teachers don't even know what a square root is. Indeed, the reason they got the job with simply because they were formerly affiliated with the president's party, virtually no institution in South Africa has been spared from the corruption, so you see one way to measure the intensity of corruption in South Africa is to look at the quality of housing that the government builds for its poorest people. If the budget is already low, when we discount what politicians take, not only in terms of money, also in construction materials, in the end, houses end up so poorly constructed that some have even collapse. Another very common form of corruption is seizing funds that were aimed at the developments of the poorest areas. For an example, we can look at dairy farms that are backed by the government.

Speaker 2:          08:41          That's okay.

Speaker 1:          08:43          The best case is that of a farm promoted directly by Moza benzies Wayne, who of course became zoom as minister of mining. So I. One day this gentleman came to a poor community and promise to build a dairy farm that was financed by the government. Supposedly the farm would be controlled by the workers who'd joined the project and who were even promised a trip to India to learn how to manage the farm. So as you can probably see from this already, it's not exactly looking great.

Speaker 3:          09:07          He said he wanted to change our lives. He said this thing was coming from the government free of charge. He said, we couldn't say don't like this thing. He said, we must take it a frame can Yamini of black South African farmer.

Speaker 1:          09:21          In the end the government spends more than $20,000,000, but the only ones who went on a trip with, uh, members of this politicians church choir, and of course he kept any leftover money as for the farm. What it is unclear if any cow milks thanks to this project, and this again is just one example. Out of hundreds in recent years, billions of dollars aimed at developments have been diverted, simply lost by the leaders of the ruling party. And of course, as you can imagine, all of this has caused a huge amounts of economic damage investing in a country where any politician can stick his hands in the coffers or where public accounts are highly unreliable, does not sound enticing. But now off Jacob Zoom is forced resignation. His party was getting nervous about the upcoming elections and the big question now becomes, will the new government change things

Speaker 2:          10:19          change

Speaker 1:          10:22          maybe the 15th, 2018. After Jacob Zoom his resignation, several roundup posts, another historic leader of the anti apartheid movement was named president. We all talking about just any guy though Mr Rammer poster, left politics at the end of the nineties and leaped into the business wells as you know, what? Thanks to his influence and his good relations with governments around the posts that became one of the wealthiest men in sub Saharan Africa. His car, unfortunately is estimated to be close to half a billion dollars. Well, the fact is that this new president has promised in new dawn and he has said that his policy will prioritize balancing public accounts, attracting investments, fighting corruption is mostly with South Africa, is open for business. Of course, these are already facing some problems. In March, the National Assembly approved the start of the process to change the constitution in such a way that the governments can express, create the lands of the white population without any compensation, and if they do carry this out, investments are certainly not going to come to the country.

Speaker 1:          11:17          In fact, they're going to flee in the end. Only time is going to tell if this new government will succeed in getting South Africans and joined the lions that are awakening for if the country will continue on its path towards the abyss.
