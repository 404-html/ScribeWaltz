Speaker 1:          00:05          Alphabet, Google's parent company and owner of the Youtube platform visit, negotiating to build a technology center in none other than Saudi Arabia. Sounds incredible, but the truth is that since Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince takeover this country has started to change a lot, at least much more than everyone would have imagined just a few years ago. So us today. Let's have a look at what exactly is happening in Saudi Arabia. Do you understand what's happening in Saudi Arabia? We need to take a look at that past to see where everything began. Well, first of all, we need to bear in mind that we're talking about a particularly young country. Saudi Arabia was formally born in 1932. Then of course Saudi Arabia was really different to how it is today. You see, back then, many oil deposits hadn't yet been discovered, so it was a very poor place that still had a spouse, semi nomadic population. The Saudi Arabia was still kind of in the Middle Ages. Now that I think about it, really a lot of things have actually changed that much, but a few years later in 1938, the first oil deposits were discovered and since then, well, let's just say that the house of sounds of the country's royal houses used oil to make Arabia look like the United States, at least in terms of aesthetics and leisure.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Well, allow me to explain myself. We're talking for example, of cities inspired by Dallas' driving American cars and building huge moles in the middle of the desert and that's exactly what they did for decades. That's not only that. Over the years the Saudi government you thanks aisle has begun to have a lot of money. You can do it kind of agreements with Washington that has lasted more or less until today. So check out disagreements. Saudi Arabia generates a huge and relatively cheap oil supply using the dollars. It's basic currency. I mean, you've probably heard of petro dollars and accumulate all the money, generates an oil sales in us treasury debt or in the Big Wall Street banks, and if that weren't enough, the Saudi government is always willing to inject millions into the powerful US owns industry.

Speaker 2:          02:26          That is, that is

Speaker 1:          02:28          lots of oil, lots of money and great business for the US military industry. So the question becomes, well, in exchange for watts, well, who basically for protection, the house of Saudi bought what essentially amounts to insurance from Washington to protect it from foreign enemies. However, in 1979, everything changed. You see, 19, 79 was a fundamental year for Arabian countries. And for Islam on the one hand to Islamic revolution happens in Iran. And on the other hand, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. And in Saudi Arabia, between November the 20th and December the fourth, a group of fanatics took over the Great Mosque of Maca and accuse the house of Southie, Saudi monarchy of betraying Islam and selling their soul to the west fanatics called for an uprising to overthrow the royal family. And that if you are is where everything changed, the house of Saudi leaders feared a revolutionary uprising and decided to please the extremists. The United States could certainly protect them from the foreign enemy, but it will be very hard for them to do soak in a popular uprising like the one that happened in Iran. So even though this part of the world wasn't exactly a paradise of freedom from that Bermans on, things got a lot, lot worse. Discrimination against women reached stratospheric levels, they religious. God began an uncontrolled campaign and Saudi Arabia began to finance all kinds of extremist groups like there was no tomorrow, both inside and outside of the country. And that's precisely the Saudi Arabia. We'll know how we'll just waste a moment because there was another turning point in 2015 this time thanks to you plummeting oil prices in the arrival of a new King Salman Bin Abdulaziz.

Speaker 2:          04:17          Great flavor overall.

Speaker 1:          04:24          This is a king who decided to give almost all the power to his son. And now his APP, Muhammad Bin Salmaan of here. We already talked about here on visual politic before. That's a new generation, took a hold of the country. My generation was held hostage by 1979. I know now that my kids will not be hostages, one Saudi banker to the New York Times. Since then, folks, a new kind of revolution has been launched to modernize the country. We've already talked about this on this channel, but the truth is that the plan is advancing at full speed and it's based on three pillars. The fight against corruption, economic change, and religious reform. So without further ado, well, let's see what's happening. Point by point.

Speaker 2:          05:06          Saudi Arabia is anti corruption crackdown. Saudi Arabia detailing 11, nearly 60 detainees, uh, promptly removed. We're being told,

Speaker 3:          05:15          sure.

Speaker 1:          05:20          Fight against corruption

Speaker 3:          05:23          the ground.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Brent's has said it both actively and passively. Corruption in Saudi Arabia is a great burden added, has to rent. Our country has suffered a lot from corruption from the 19 eighties until today. The calculation of our experts is that roughly 10 percent of all government spending was siphoned off by corruption each year from the top levels to the bottom. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as you know, was as it was said, so it was done last November, that's 2017 prince's businessmen, ministersx, politicians, and a huge number of people were invited to dine with the king or to meet with the crown prince. Of course, only in a country like Saudi Arabia that we would see a prison like this. This is the Ritz Carlton at reacts a very, very luxurious hotel. Of course, nos. Everything was comfortable after all, it became a prison that held such illustrious prisoners as Prince Alwaleed bin Talal grandson of the kingdoms own founder, known as the Warren Buffett of the Middle East.

Speaker 1:          06:18          This is a prince who, according to Forbes magazine, has a fortunate to have almost $18,000,000,000 in just one of twitter's largest shareholders. Well, not even he, even with all this money managed to escape all the prisoners were held incommunicado and couldn't even contact their lawyers rights. Legal guarantees. Come on, we're in Saudi Arabia, but what do you think the Saudi government asked for to release them? Well, nothing less than giving part of their fortunes and companies as compensation for all the corruption that they were involved in as well. Here's a question. Do you know how much the Saudi government raised with this trick? This up, because this is an astounding number. It wasn't one or five or 10 billion, but it was approximately an one popping $107,000,000,000.

Speaker 3:          07:07          Of course,

Speaker 1:          07:08          a few detractors have accused the crown prince of carrying out this campaign, not with the intention of fighting corruption class with the aim of strengthening his power. For example, seizing control of the foreign based media. Yes, the detainees included important media businessmen bots have you at this doesn't end here also at all the economic change as we've mentioned on visual politics. Saudi Arabia wants to emulate Dubai and leave their dependence on oil behinds and they want to do it hand in hand with private capital just as we saw in Google's case.

Speaker 3:          07:52          Of course,

Speaker 1:          07:52          on the other hand, as Prince Mohammed bin Salman is also very fond of big projects. The last one he publicized was Naomi Macro city that the government wants to build in the Red Sea next to Jordan and Egypt. Check out some of these numbers, 500 $500,000,000,000 in public and private investments in order to urbanize and build a city that is larger in area than El Salvador. This is a 10,000 square mile place that will have its own laws, its own courts and its own taxes. This is a new city that the crown prince wants to turn into a great transport hub as a huge international business center. Basically a much more modern and much bigger Dubai, and this isn't his only project. Saudi Arabia plans a huge Red Sea beach tourism project. The project will cover 50 islands and 34,000 square kilometers an area bigger than Belgium and there's a few more. Prince's idea is to get all these cities to have laws and standards different from those in the rest of the country. Laws they can attract investors, attract tourists and entrepreneurs. The question is, will really be able to make all of these projects work in a country that is so anchored in the past.

Speaker 3:          09:04          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          09:09          When he's like that, it doesn't seem easy at first, but I suppose we'll see so far. People like Richard Branson certainly support the strategy,

Speaker 4:          09:22          the religious change,

Speaker 1:          09:26          sleep. There's the religious changed, the princes latest and great obsession is the struggle against Islamic fundamentalism or its most radical interpretations. You see, Saudi Arabia is a country of restrictions, which is something we probably all know and it may never cease being so. However, just a few years ago, nobody could have imagined we'd see so many changes and quite so quickly concerts and movies which had been bands have returned to the country. The religious God has lost almost all of its power. Women can now attend sports stadiums and since June they can also drive. I go on any further. On December the sixth, 2017, the Lebanese singer hereby to start in Saudi Arabia first. All female concepts. Yes. Even the audience was entirely made up of women and this is something we couldn't even have imagined just three years ago. Listen to this reflection,

Speaker 4:          10:17          privileged to be the generation that has seen the before and the after, the previous generation of Saudi. Women could never imagine a day when a woman could drive and the coming generation will never be able to imagine a day when a woman couldn't. A 30 year old Saudi woman social entrepreneur to the New York Times. The person in charge of this entire process is Mohammed bin Salman. We aren't restoring Islam to its origins and our biggest tools are the prophets practices. At the time of the Prophet Mohammed, there were musical theaters. There was mixing between men and women. There's a SPEC for Christians and Jews and Arabia. The first commercial, Judge Medina was a woman. So if the profit embrace all of this, do you mean the profit was not a Muslim crown? Prince Mohammed bin Salman

Speaker 1:          10:58          for a Saudi Arabian data to say something like this, while the only word is wow, and by the way, don't think that Saudi Arabia was always the place it was in the past. Of course, it was always a very, very conservative country to conservative. Certainly not the hell that it became in 1979. The short, as you can see, even though there's still a lot to change, things seem to be on the right track. Although of course there are certainly still dark areas. He Qatar, blockade failure, the Yemen war and the princess obsession with Taran ran

Speaker 4:          11:29          team leader is the new Hitler of the Middle East, but we learned from Europe that appeasement doesn't work. We don't want the new Hitler in Iran to repeat what happened in Europe in the Middle East, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Speaker 1:          11:40          This prince is a take charge kind of man, but to tell the truth so far, his international attempts have been resounding failures as we saw with Yemen and other problem is that the Arabic countries, economies are going from bad to worse. In 2017, they suffered that first recession since 2009 and public deficit is still skyrocketing, growing by more than $50 million dollars every year, and of course that can make it hard for the prince to carry out his plants. In any case, having seen this, I think we can say that the oil was some of the best news for everyone, especially for Saudi Arabian women,

Speaker 4:          12:13          turning to what we have done before, a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world. We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today. We will end extremism very soon. Mohammed bin Salman.

Speaker 1:          12:26          Anyway, that's how things are, but now it's your turn. Do you think Saudi Arabia will manage to change itself?
