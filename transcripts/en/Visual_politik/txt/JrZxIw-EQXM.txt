Speaker 1:          00:09          We know immigration is a hot topic in the United States, and of course it's a polarizing subject. You might be in favor of it, we might be against it, but you're unlikely to be neutral. You're probably also think that immigration is either an opportunity or it's a threat,

Speaker 2:          00:23          and Jane Migration Ending Chain Migration and canceling the visa lottery. President trump has railed against the immigration family reunification program since 2016, making it a centerpiece of his campaign for president, but now that the first lady's parents, his in laws have used the program to have to become US citizens. Critics are the ones having the field day. Shane migration is one of the disasters. Chain migration is a disaster. Disaster. A total disaster chain migration, however,

Speaker 1:          00:57          was in the United States. There's another kind of immigration that isn't talked about very much, but which involves a huge flow of people moving from one territory to another. Every single. Yeah, I'm talking about interstate immigration, the kind of immigration that happens between the states that make up the entire country. This is something that creates winners and losers. Steak,

Speaker 2:          01:17          sweet have losers. We have losers.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Also, folks after Donald Trump and the republican party's latest fiscal reform and everything indicates that this type of immigration is going to grow. Obviously, as you can imagine, people tend to immigrate to the most prosperous territories. So here are a few questions that you might now be asking yourselves. What interstate immigration trends are happening in the United States? What does this type of integration entail? Which states are the winners and which are the losers? Why and well, what can we expect in the future? Well, let someone look at all of that. Shall We? Winners and losers. Yeah. Millions of Americans pack up their bags and move to another state.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Some states have positive immigration balances every year. That is to say year after year more compatriots arrive, then leave, and also of course the opposite happens. Some states see many residents move to another state every year, many more than the number who arrive. This is because states compete with each other. Of course, each state has its own characteristics. It's own regulations, its own taxes, policies, and logically. This makes some states much more prosperous than others. Obviously people tend to move to more prosperous places to states where there's more work, there's better living conditions and where more companies are being established. Well according to data from the irs or internal revenue service, the federal government agency responsible for collecting taxes between the end of 2015 and the start of 2016 to two point eight percent of taxpayers and moved to another state. According to this information now, and I assure you that the irs has the best data in the United States, the migration rates, the internal mobility in the United States is very and I mean very high compared to other developed countries. Having said this, do you want to know which states that the greatest migration read deficit that is the states with the greatest difference between Americans leaving and arriving pay? Yeah. Well, check this out.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Yes. As you can see, New York is in the lead as the least attractive state for Americans to stay in in net terms only in 2016 and discounting arrivals more than 150,000 Americans

Speaker 3:          03:37          left.

Speaker 1:          03:41          It's followed by other states such as Illinois, New Jersey, and California, and really could anyone imagine the California, the land of technology, gorgeous beaches in good weather would be on this list. Well, there it is. And now the opposite question. What are the states with the greatest migratory surplus of Americans? Well, check this out. Florida with a positive balance of about 200,000 Americans has become the big

Speaker 3:          04:11          winner.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Mind you, this information is from 2016, but if instead of taking the data from the last available, yeah, we looked at a longer period of time. For example, since the beginning of the 19 nineties, the result is practically the same. New York, California, and Illinois last, the most Americans while Florida, Arizona, and Texas one the most.

Speaker 1:          04:35          And hold on a second here because this is really much more important than you might be thinking during the video we made recently about the hidden debts of the different states in America. Well folks, every time estate loses Americans, it loses a bit of wealth. For example, the almost 200,000 Americans, he moved to Florida in net terms in 2016 as an income of more than $17,000,000,000 a year. This is an income that from now on will be produced within Florida positive. This will be saved in the state's financial entities while another part will be spent in its stores and supermarkets, cinemas, restaurants and gas stations, and another part that will be invested in new businesses that will be mainly located within Florida. All of this means more wealth, more work, and what tax revenues for the state. So at this point you might be beginning to see why this is quite so important. However, having seen all this, the question does remain well, what variables? They explained this movement of people. Well listen up competition. There are many reasons why people move from one place to another. This family work, climate opportunities, universities, plenty of things. However, if we take all of the data into our accounts, there are a couple of factors that really stand out. One of them is taxes

Speaker 1:          05:58          in 2016, almost 600,000 people moved from the 25 states with the highest access to the 25 states with the lowest taxes. In fact, the 25 states with the highest taxes, no less than 24 has a net immigration. That is they so more Americans leaving. Then arriving, displaying while sometimes said internal migration isn't motivated by the weather or things like that. Well, California does suffer from this deficit to state like New Hampshire, which is small, cold, mountainous, and has a narrow coastline. They've recorded a surplus since the year 2000 and listen up because Rhode Island for Mon said, Massachusetts all have much higher taxes and they lose Americans every year and yes, New Hampshire is the state. We're the second lowest taxes in the United States. Coincidence, oh no. Runs in the Midwest. While South Dakota generally registers a surplus of immigrants from year to year. It's neighboring states, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota, which has higher taxes, have had migration deficits for five consecutive years, and then this Kentucky versus Tennessee or California versus Nevada, Texas versus Washington states with higher taxes lose and states with lower taxes.

Speaker 4:          07:09          When

Speaker 1:          07:12          Morris study done by economists from the Treasury Department estimated that when New Jersey raised at state income tax in 2004 by almost two point five points, it caused more than $80 million as to change residences every year. That might not seem like much, but the truth is that residents with higher rates, they pay proportionately more taxes. Now, hold on a second because with taxes come regulations for example, and perhaps especially those that affect housing, see a combination of high property taxes and several regulations and limitations make living in one particular state, much more expensive than living in another. This is what happens in California. California is fed up with housing costs and taxes are fleeing state in big numbers. Folks renting an apartment in Las Vegas or phoenix costs on average, less than half of the cost of an apartment in Los Angeles or San Francisco. Not much housing and a lot of demand led to incredibly high price and of course this makes moving to another state worth it for many people, even if they learn less. So this has been the case so far and we can see that the effect that all of this has is very important. States with a migration, sepsis, this have also been able to grow more public because they have more attractive policies for companies, entrepreneurs and we've also seen yes, but from now on, everything indicates that the effects will be even greater. This is all thanks to Donald Trump and the republican party's tax reform. Listen up

Speaker 1:          08:41          more competition.

Speaker 3:          08:45          This

Speaker 1:          08:45          may be one of the best things that Donald trump has done, the fiscal reform at the end of 2017. Not only humans, improving taxation for companies, but also boosting competition among the states. Until now, the federal government subsidized parts of estates taxes. This is because they weren't deductible, but what you paid to the state was deducted from the taxes that you have to pay to the federal government. This is something that worked as an incentive for states to raise taxes. Tax Reform has limited the situation so that the number of households that can deduct so local and state taxes has dropped from 42 million homes in 2017 to about $70, million in 2018 all while having a smaller deduction amounts. This has been the equivalent of an automatic tax increase in the states with higher taxes because now that taxpayers will have to pay the state tax and practically the entire federal tax. For example, according to the calculations of the Cato Foundation, a tax plan from the state of New York in 2017 would have received a rate of 33 percent on federal income tax and $30,000 on state and local taxes. It could have decreased federal taxes like $10,000. That is thanks to his deduction at state and local taxes would have cost $20,000. However, with the new tax reform though now I have to pay $30,000 for state and local taxes, which is 33 percent more. And people really feel that asking,

Speaker 1:          10:09          so now the differences between the states with the highest taxes in the states with the lowest taxes is going to be much greater perhaps at the high tax states, didn't have this federal crutch to prop up their big spending. They might have to cut taxes to stay competitive. Ronald Reagan as the Wall Street Journal recently published as a boom in Florida for wealthy boss who wants to purchase real estate and to establish their residents there. And you know why? Well, it probably has something to do with the fact that Florida doesn't have a state income tax and that it's property taxes are also relatively low.

Speaker 1:          10:42          Anyway, she knew what this all means. Well, it means no less than a new era of competition between the states of the USA has begun from now on. State governments will feel a lot more pressure to manage their budgets well. The good news is that the evidence points to this being good for everyone. Basically, a growing rivalry between states is beginning to develop behind the scenes a rivalry to be the most desirable and affordable place for US citizens to live.
