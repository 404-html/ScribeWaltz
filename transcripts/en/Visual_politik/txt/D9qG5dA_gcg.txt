Speaker 1:          00:08          No way, it's famous for its extreme climates, have long sunny summer days and long dark winter nights as well as the extreme cold, so famous for their welfare state, like any other Nordic country, but perhaps most of all, they're famous for this smoked salmon

Speaker 1:          00:27          and it's not just us that visual politic. You think that it's actually the fishing industry is one of the most modern and important in the world. However, in the last few years, the most significant element of the Norwegian identity has been its commitment to the environment, especially its fight against climate change and there is no better place for us to see this than in their adoption of the electric car. You see Norway, it has the most developed market of electric cars in the world in. You'll find that one of every two cars sold is either electric or it's a hybrid, but it's even more to this because by 20, 25, which is kind of basically tomorrow, Norway expects to stop selling gas or diesel powered cars altogether. They only want to sell electric and hybrid cars. Now, this might be pretty hard to imagine, right? I mean, it's been a hundred years of combustion engines and it all seems as if he's about to come to an end. Middle East,

Speaker 2:          01:18          Norway,

Speaker 1:          01:21          they're electric car mania. Well, it's even reached ships to companies are currently developing a project called Tesla over the seas. It's goal is to launch the first autonomous ship that's powered by electric batteries. The first Yara Berkland, the formal name of the project. It's expected to be ready by the end of 2018, and this might all, if you're wondering, well, what's Norway Secrets? How on earth they made electric cars quite so popular? Is it really all to do about just concern for the environment?

Speaker 1:          01:54          Yeah, I mean maybe that is a positive, but if we're honest, the majority reason, well, it's a little less idealistic. The key for this electric Colombian, it's got everything to do with the tax incentives that the government has granted in order to support the industry. So look, in Norway, when you choose to buy a vehicle, you can actually save an enormous amount in taxes. If you choose to go for an electric vehicle, for instance, for one, you don't pay any VAT and in Norway, and that's 25 percent right off the bat, you don't have to pay any registration fees or any other additional taxes. All right, so this all sounds well and good, but what is the actual results of this all financial. So according to a recent study, you got this car, the Tesla model s. Now if this was a regular gas car, if you included all the taxes and everything else, this thing in noise going to set you back about $140,000, but thanks to the tax relief of the Norwegian government, this is actually around $70,000, which is 50 percent in savings, which is pretty amazing.

Speaker 2:          02:54          Right?

Speaker 1:          02:56          And that's not even mentioning the other advantages. I mean these costs, they don't have to pay for any tolls and they don't have to pay. Parking meters will say there's another major advantage because in Norway electricity it's mostly hydroelectric, which means well, it's both cheap and it's clean. All right? So as a result of these policies and some of the policies, the government expects to reduce total carbon emissions by 40 percent in the next few years. If you consider all of these advantages, like being able to get a test liver 70 grands ams, the fact that it has one of the highest living standards in the world, you might be thinking right now, well Norway sounds like a pretty amazing place, but taking things back to the environment for a minute, the Norwegian constitution, it even actually protect the environment. Consider Article One hundred and 10. Every person has a right to an environment that is conducive to health and to a natural environment who's productivity and diversity are maintained.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Natural resources should be managed on the basis of comprehensive longterm considerations whereby this right will be safeguarded for future generations as well. Article One hundred and 10 B of Norway's constitution. Alright, so as always in one of these videos, not everything is sunshine and lollipops and rainbows. So noise is this really wealthy country and they've got this really big welfare state, but they do have a small issue or released a problem that makes green beast really angry. And this issue, it is about the oil production of Norway. But now the question really has to become, I mean, how oil dependent is Norway? Well, let's have a look at that. Oil addicts,

Speaker 1:          04:30          we can take a time machine back to the beginning of the 20th century, we would find Norway with a really basic economy. All they did was fishing, fishing, and fishing. Now, if we traveled forward in time, even though things did improve significantly, Norway during the 19 sixties, no way included in the list of the world's wealthiest countries, not at all. In fact, its per capita income was around half of Switzerland's, 1960. The standard of living in Norway was about 30 or 40 percent lower than in Sweden or Denmark. Now the standard of living in Norway is substantially higher than those who countries renewal guerard and economists, the Norwegian business school in Oslo. So now the obvious question becomes, well, what happens? In what way? How did it become one of the richest countries on earth in so little time where everything began to change in the year? Nineteen 69. This was the year when the first oil reserves were found and the as the ad, well, it's been a bit of a golden age. The country became one of the world's largest oil and natural gas suppliers. As you can imagine, that this oil revolution means tons of money coming in, money that contributed to building the Norway that we know today,

Speaker 1:          05:36          today oil and natural gas are the keys of this country's economy. In 2016, for instance, almost 40 percent of exports and more than a fifth of investment had its origin in the oil and gas sector. And of course I mean governments. It's getting it's share depending on the year and the prices of gasoline. All the income that the government obtains from this industry route one of every 41 of every six euros of the government's total tax collection, and I want to give them. He gets a ton of money. Well, that usually means an increase in public spending. World's most generous welfare state leaves 20 percent on the Dole. Yeah, that's absolutely right. To a certain extent, we could say the Norwegian model of a huge welfare state with public control of many of the large companies has a lot to do with oil. However, the tumbling all of the pros of this raw material has led the government to take an incredibly controversial measure for the first time in 20 years. The Norwegian government, it's granting new exploration licenses in particular tenure instances of oil exploration in the Barents Sea, in the heart of the artist.

Speaker 2:          06:38          Exactly

Speaker 1:          06:46          this, this movement has made Greenpeace and other environmental organizations really, really angry great days by the way. They've taken the government to court, accusing them of violating the Paris agreements and also, uh, violating the Norwegian constitution itself. As we just told you a moment ago, the environment, it's pretty well protected in Norwegian law, but the thing is Norway's green commitments. Well, this is set in limitations knowing has set out to be a global leader in climate action, yet continued expansion of oil and gas production could eclipse the benefits of Norway's domestic emission reductions efforts. Peter Erickson as senior scientists within the Stockholm Environment Institute and well, the reality is that the world's largest welfare state, it's certainly does not come cheap. We as a country are petro holics. We depend so much on the income from the oil. Just like alcoholics. We want to stop, but we don't know how Thomas Nielsen, editor of the independent parents observer, but, but, but wait for a minute because it is not like Norway is like some of those other countries that also rely on oil. Absolutely not. Norway is dependent on oil to a certain extent, but it's not even close to how dependent Venezuela or Saudi Arabia are honest in Norway things. They are totally different now. Although the government does carry a lot of economic weight. Norway has tried to be open to business and they have tried to use this oil money to fund productive activities and provide a quality education. They have also been incredibly committed to saving

Speaker 1:          08:16          fund of funds

Speaker 2:          08:19          for

Speaker 1:          08:19          a country that has made so much money with the oil industry. Norway is very different to what we are used to the capital city. It's not overtaken by skyscrapers, massive malls, extravagant complexes. Now, don't get me wrong, they have spent a lot of money, but the key to Norway is that they haven't wasted it. The Norwegian government, they make this really sensible decision. They decided to save a lot of their oil money. They set up a sovereign wealth funds at to invest the money and buy assets all around the globe, and this is the biggest sovereign wealth fund on Earth. Not even Saudi Arabia, not even Kuwait, have saved so much. Now consider this. Norway sovereign wealth fund hits $1,000,000,000,000. Yeah, that's absolutely right. That's a trillion dollars. This is a fortunate of around $190,000 per Norwegian citizens. Instead of wasting this money, they invested it in companies all around the world.

Speaker 1:          09:09          This fund is invested money or more than 9,000 companies in 78 countries. Some of these companies really famous. Your apple, Nestle, Shell alphabet. That's better known as Google. Indeed. We could save that. The Norwegians, well, they even own a part of Youtube and you know what? One of their targets is to eventually replace that oil income with income from these investments. I mean these are investments, they produce profit. It's what they do and these prophets have been a return of about five point seven percent a year, so if these levels of return will speak at the same, Norway would have an average of $50,000,000,000 in profit, which is equivalent to about 25 percent of their public spending starting to sound pretty good. Right? And on top of all of that, of course there's the income that the government gets from oil and local companies, companies that despite being state homes, they do work with market criteria are. So it's still looking pretty rosy. I mean you might be thinking right now that Norway, what does it have to worry about, but hold on for just a moment because the welfare level, it does seem to have a solid base, but the government is absolutely determined to achieve economic diversification in order to have a more competitive economy so that they ultimately get rid of their dependency on oil.

Speaker 2:          10:21          The reforms.

Speaker 1:          10:25          Nineteen, 27. The center left party has been the most popular in general elections, but in Norway, absolutely majority's. They're not really common in 2013, a coalition of center, right wing parties like the progress bar see famous for its radical position on immigration. Managed to put Erna Solberg in office. She is known as the Norwegian version of Angela Merkel in the recent elections that happened on the 11th of September 2017. This coalition, when it was reelected and the intensive, this government is to get some distance from what has become known as the Norwegian model. The government, they want to improve the competitiveness of the country by reducing taxes, especially for companies both public and private, but at the same time they also intend to keep developing the oil industry

Speaker 2:          11:13          anyway anyway,

Speaker 1:          11:15          if they are sure about something. In Norway, it is the innovation and development are the best ways to obtain high standards of living and improve the environment.
