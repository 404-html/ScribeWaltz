Speaker 1:          00:07          Just before we get started, I'd like to give a quick plug for a new channel that I've started at school biographics where we look at biographies of famous people from history as well as the present day. It's not all politics or that we have done some politics. We've looked at Vladimir Putin as well as almost swartz and I got. I know he definitely covers both fields, but please do check it out. There is a link in the description below our, I'd say you probably know pieces of field build companies and I support people who are building new things. He was one of the founders of paypal, the first investor in facebook, and he's one of the most important technology and venture capital Gurus in the world. He's obviously a multibillionaire. That is also a bit of a peculiar guy. For instance, he financed projects like the Sea Standing Institute in organization aimed at being a politically autonomous floating city and is also funded anti aging research by using the blood of young people.

Speaker 1:          00:55          These are the thiel is also known for being the biggest supporter of Donald Trump in silicon valley. Although in some conversations with journalists recently, he's already shown some concerns. I mean, what the hell all of us have the right to be wrong sometimes. The thing is this, in 2011 Peter Thiel was granted New Zealand citizenship and told his application. He said this, I'm happy to say categorically that I've found no other country that aligns more with my view of the future, the New Zealand. The truth is that this is probably no surprise to you, regular viewers, a visual politic. We've already said into other videos how much we love this country and not just for its beauty. Although New Zealand is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. There are also an example to be followed to take a look at these statements. All former prime minister billing about his predecessor.

Speaker 2:          01:41          Occasionally John would come home and complain that he was the only one who didn't have a jet and how his colleagues were horrified to find that he as a world leader had to travel on commercial aircraft, but I assured him that it was character building and kept them in touch with normal people. Bill English,

Speaker 1:          01:56          no New Zealand doesn't have an air force one of their own, but it is one of the easiest countries to do business in and as we've already seen, it's one of the most prosperous, least corrupt and safest countries on the

Speaker 3:          02:07          planets.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Unless onto that, they're first rate public services. Their ranking is one of the countries with the highest standards of living as well as having one of the lowest employment rates. Just take a look at this chart. They weren't always like this. The Sun didn't always ride. There's no doubt that New Zealand is a top rate country, but things weren't always like that. I'm definitely not. Not at all. In fact, what we are going to see now is a real story. The story of the country that was determined to learn from its mistakes, to transform everything didn't work, and by doing so become an international role. Well, this is definitely not the norm. Placing people first before any kind of ideology and the electorial interests. It's not so common, at least not in most countries, but let's see what happens.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Well, the first thing we have to say is that New Zealand was always a relatively wealthy country. In fact, by the late 19 fifties, this country had the third highest per capita income in the world, which is certainly not bad, right? Just wait a moment because that's the moment when things started to get a bit worse, bad enough. In fact, the by 1984, the per capita income was similar to that of Portugal or Turkey. So. Well now you're probably wondering, well what happens, but New Zealand's to drop so far. Well, it could be said that the government, they went a bit too far. By that time, the government of New Zealand had meddled with the economy to such an extent that it's hard to even imagine what it was like.

Speaker 1:          04:05          There were many, many taxes. Most of them incredibly complex and most of them really, really high. Just so you can get an idea of that. The highest income tax rate was almost 70 percent and the lowest was still 40 percent and companies, well, they didn't get any better treatments. The profit tax was 48 percent, which is twice as much as the world's average nowadays, and on top of all of that, there were tons of regulations. There were price controls for almost any product, currency controls, and that's just scratching the surface as an example. Any import require the approval of the administration and it was really hard for New Zealanders to invest their money outside of the country. We have foreign exchange controls. That meant I couldn't buy a subscription to the Economist magazine without the permission of the Minister of Finance, Maurice, p mcteague, former minister of the government of New Zealand. Look the controls and regulations. They didn't just establish a minimum wages. They also set caps for the maximum. Yep. You heard that? Absolutely right. But let's say that a business owner wanted to pay a bonus to his workers. Well, that wasn't an easy task

Speaker 3:          05:06          ask

Speaker 1:          05:13          and as you can imagine, the state owned and controlled almost every large national company, media, airlines, insurance companies, banks, even hotels. Yet the government was really managing hotels. Not Joking here. So in other words, the early 19 eighties, New Zealand was the very example of extreme statism in one way or another. Almost everything was controlled by bureaucrats and politicians and so well, what were the consequences of all this? They weren't exactly positive,

Speaker 3:          05:39          right.

Speaker 1:          05:44          After 23 years of deficits and the government's balance public debt has absolutely skyrocketed. It was to figure unemployment's private investors were pulling out of the country and the Kiwi youth, while they were fleeing in huge numbers by that time doing business in New Zealand, it was an enormously complicated process. And to be honest, it was only attempted by the bravest. Everything started to change in 1984 when elections took place. Plan to move forward

Speaker 1:          06:21          in 1984 in the midst of a tough crisis, elections were celebrated. The winner was David longer you have the center left party. This nation is at risk is how basic it is. The new government, they had a purpose to overcome the crisis and still change the national model. They are to replace everything that didn't work and to make sure they did it without leaving anybody behind. While at the same time granting the opportunities for others to move forward. So even though David [inaudible] was the prime minister, the leader of this whole process was the minister of Finance and that was sent Roger Douglas. In fact, the process is named after him. It's known as Roger Nomix. We went probably from being the most regulated, uh, in the developed world to the least Reagan a regulator. We actually discussed this in a previous video where we talked about the agricultural reforms that have been so successful in New Zealand is Roger Douglas started and ambitious reform program known as Rajan Nanex in this program that many areas of the economy were liberalized and this included the primary sector and these changes took place almost overnight. Price controls were eliminated and most farming subsidies were removed. But Roger Nomix, it wasn't just about agriculture. The plan affected almost every aspect of the state and created a new political culture. In fact, by the time the rights international party won the elections in 1990 and took power again, everything had changed. And the new government followed the labor process. Roger Nomix. It was a political philosophy that radically changed the country between the year 1984 and the beginnings of the 21st century.

Speaker 1:          08:03          The first thing that the government did was declared a war on bureaucracy. They did it in three ways. First, they did a thorough analysis of every governmental departments. If what they did was not essential or could be better done by the market as well. That was the end of it. Following the same pattern. They started an ambitious plan of privatization. I mean, think about it. What was the state doing? Wasting time managing hotels, airlines or telecommunications, thanks to competition. The market could do a much better job hands with less cost and more innovation. Pie Come at it from an angle of what's good for the consumer. Uh, the provider. I don't care a fundamentally who the provider might be a might be a public institution, a private institution, so long as it serves the consumer or the taxpayer. That's where I come from. Seconds of the 35 remaining public agencies, the government made management work under market conditions.

Speaker 1:          08:57          This was the case for air traffic controllers for instance. And the results, they were totally terrific. Not so neat. Did the services of these public agencies improve? They went from costing the government a billion dollars every year to generating with taxes and profits more than a billion dollars. This is money that could then be put into things like education, health care and culture. But that wasn't the end of it. Since regulations and laws were numerous and complex, the government decided to work towards an important goal and that was the simplification and elimination of any laws that they deemed unnecessary. And so what was the result of all of these changes when you started this process with the Department of Transportation? It had 5,600 employees. When we finished it had 53. When we started with the forest service, it had 17,000 employees. When we finished it had 17. Maurice p mcteague ends unemployment's. It didn't increase. It was reduced. So there's this very illustrative story and it actually involves deer as in the animals. So when the British arrived in New Zealand, the country doesn't have any large animals. So the wealthy families, they imported deer for hunting as well. Can you guess what happens these days? They spread rapidly, forming the massive herds that ghost critical ecological damage by overgrazing thought 120 years. The state had spent a lot of money trying to think this plague in order to preserve the local ecosystem.

Speaker 3:          10:19          Well,

Speaker 1:          10:23          one day they came up with a new idea. Why couldn't they let farmers hunt and raised the deer fence? Well, that's exactly what they did. Not saying that you did this, put an end to the plague. New Zealand today is the world's largest supplier of deer meat and all of this. It really does make sense and it's also interesting to see what happened to taxes which were simplified in Regina. Many were surprised by the results. Tax Collection actually increased by 20 percent.

Speaker 1:          11:02          The subsidization. It was cost not only in agriculture but also in industry sectors, but there was much more than just economic reform here, the reforms that reached the public services and take a look at what happens with education. For instance, the education budget of New Zealand. It hadn't stopped growing for years, but the results, they were just getting worse and worse. So the question was, well, a we students getting more stupid and that didn't really seem likely so when the government analyze the causes, they realize this, an important share of the budget was not actually being spent on education, but on administration. These were quality evaluation agencies, rating firms, dossie agencies and so on. So what did the government decide to do? Well, they simply removed it all and they gave the schools control with a management board chosen by the parents. Also, they allow parents to choose schools freely, private or public, and the government would pay for it. And well, what we can tell you now is that education results improved significantly as well. The same thing, it happens with everything else.

Speaker 1:          12:05          New Zealand today, it's a prosperous country with a very high standard of living and to use public services, education, health and culture are among the best in the world. So that leaves us thinking that museum, that it's an amazing example for countries in Latin America or some European countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal. Well, if anything is for certain, is that the lands of Kiwis is a great country. And now it's your turn. Do you think that New Zealand makes a good model to be followed?
