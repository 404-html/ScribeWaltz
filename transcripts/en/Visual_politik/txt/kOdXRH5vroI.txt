Speaker 1:          00:08          Hong Kong is one of those places that probably needs no introduction because you already know will have is situated in the south of China. Hong Kong is a lively bustling city with a great deal of contrasts

Speaker 2:          00:23          in Hong Kong.

Speaker 1:          00:24          It isn't surprising to see ancient Lori's running alongside luxury cars. You'll also see ruins buildings right next to fancy modern skyscrapers and you'll see top notch restaurants next to street food cars. They all do have one thing in common. They occupy tiny spaces. This is true whether the location is a high ends mold or just a traditional storefronts. Whatever business you operate in Hong Kong, the most is made of every single square meter. Hong Kong was one of the biggest miracles of the 20th century. In fact, it was the model Milton Friedman himself looked at in order to prove his pro free trade thesis.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Free market really is obliged to come.

Speaker 1:          01:09          World Water You, Hong Kong's population. It was around 600,000 people. It has an income equivalent to about a quarter of the United Kingdom's 60 years later and the population now exceeds 7 million people and the per capita income is almost equal to the UK. When purchasing power is considered, its GDP is much larger than the one in the UK.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Sixty years. Hong Kong has not only become the fourth most significant financial center in the world and one of the 10 most important markets, but it has also become a shell sap and millions of Chinese citizens through escapes the poverty and violence of Mao's China. With all the economic development is economic freedom is something that you can really feel in the air in Hong Kong. Now, Hong Kong cannot exactly be considered a free paradise, but nowadays it can be considered the freest economy in the world and the fourth easiest place to do business in the world.

Speaker 2:          02:07          Anyway,

Speaker 1:          02:07          the kings are Hong Kong's economic development is going to be discussed in a future video, but today we're going to focus on the politics of Hong Kong and the threats against its institutional structure which might even compromise its future economic development. And to do so, we're gonna have to start by looking at the great paradox that China is facing, the paradox which has become something of a hallmark for the country.

Speaker 2:          02:33          Ongoing Kong

Speaker 1:          02:33          was a British colony until 1997 when the city integrated into China. Again, it's something that hadn't happened since the 19th century. China was and today remains a dictatorship, lacking respect for human rights and having very few civil liberties. This forced the governments in London and Beijing to negotiate a solution. The citizens of Hong Kong didn't want to lose that fundamental rights, and London simply couldn't tolerate the Chinese applying their authoritarians of

Speaker 2:          03:00          city

Speaker 1:          03:04          negotiations. In 1984, they reached an agreement known as the Sino British joint declaration, which established for 50 years after the integration, Hong Kong would have a different political system than the one in mainland China. This meant that after 1997, Hong Kong became a special administrative region where these so called basic law replies. This is a lot of the grants, its citizens' rights and freedoms that would be unimaginable in any other place in China with the exception of Macau which was integrated into China following the same model, the citizens in Hong Kong have freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of publication, freedom of Assembly and association, and it's even freedom of demonstration. Further, Hong Kong has its own currency, its own immigration policy and customs policy, its own police and even has its own courts. So at first things went really well. Following this policy and the economic growth we mentioned earlier, certainly did help the citizens cap that reign free status. They could apply their own policies and Hong Kong became the natural entrance for foreign investment into

Speaker 2:          04:02          China

Speaker 1:          04:06          for a few years. Things started to get rather worse. The basic law we mentioned a moment ago acknowledges civil rights but not civil democracy. In fact, China has control over the parliaments and the city's executive power. So how did they do this? Well, first in Hong Kong, only half of the MPS are chosen through the popular vote. The other half were chosen by a closed group formed of entrepreneurs and institutions close to China

Speaker 3:          04:34          now watching Jolyon separatists arguing for independence from China. They were excluded from the chamber for using offensive language.

Speaker 1:          04:44          There is the head of the executive branch, and that's the prime minister who was chosen by a committee of 1000, 200 people involved or Linkedin, one way or another to the communist party. In addition to that, all public officials must take an oath of allegiance and commitments to China. Because of this, there's an argument to be made that some of these positions are actually in legitimate. Finally, the Basic Law states that the autonomy of Hong Kong is subordinate to Chinese people's congrats, special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. However, the trees, he demanded that from 2017, the executive chief hat to be chosen by popular vote, and this leads us to the part of the story. When China started to break their word over and over again,

Speaker 2:          05:40          the 31st

Speaker 1:          05:41          of August, 2014, the national congress in Beijing started the electoral reform, which would choose the government chief in this special region, and here was the surprise, yes, Beijing did acknowledge that this should be chosen by popular vote, but they could only choose between two or three who had been previously selected by the Communist Party. Yes. Some surprisingly, the Chinese do have a rather different idea of democracy, so over the next few days the people really started rising up first. These were protests by students, some of them as young as 17 years old. Can you explain to a young educated students who grew up with full access to the Internet and the media that they are actually going to have to live under a Chinese dictatorship after all

Speaker 4:          06:25          and 2017, I believe that will be more demonstrations and protests, especially under the interface of Beijing government, is just proved the failure of one country, two system

Speaker 1:          06:35          reaction to the authorities to these first strikes and mobilizations wasn't very friendly. They decided to use force, but the results, it was the opposite of what they were expecting. Instead of containing the protests, more and more people took to the streets, moved by the fear of having to remain under the rule of Beijing in a short time, a huge demonstration developed in the center of Hong Kong. I did many of the organizations occupy central and scholar Ism,

Speaker 4:          06:59          not only me, oh well, let's go home until feel we awake at bluff.

Speaker 1:          07:05          Police started using tear gas and pepper spray to control the protesters, and the population started using towels, mosques, and umbrellas to mitigate the effect of the gas. For this reason, the protests actually became known as the umbrella.

Speaker 2:          07:17          You should. The occupation

Speaker 1:          07:21          of central Hong Kong lasted for 79 days and since then the conflict has continued with some spontaneous outbreaks and young people getting more radical and not just demanding democracy, but demanding independence from China. This is something, by the way, that China has said that they absolutely will not tolerate under any circumstances, even if they have to use military force. As an interesting aside, hey, by the way, China has recently kidnapped five librarians in Hong Kong for spreading ideas against Chinese control of the city.

Speaker 5:          07:49          I was visiting my girlfriend in the mainland and I was stopped by two officials at the border. They took me to a police fan where there were dozens of policemen waiting up to you. Then I was taken to the police station in Schengen when I was held in the prisoners compound and interrogated largely

Speaker 1:          08:03          because of these protests. The September 2016 elections were celebrated as many of the protests leaders were chosen as mps. There are antibodies using pro independence positions have opened up the conflict door again since September two, mps have already been expelled from their offices under pressure for maintenance

Speaker 2:          08:19          China,

Speaker 1:          08:38          and as I mentioned earlier in this video, civil rights are only protected in Hong Kong until 20, 47 and it seems that every day China's involvement in the city grows and grows and this does come with a price. Potential investors in China through Hong Kong starting to perceive a risk. This is probably one of the why Singapore has experienced such strong growth in the last few years, so that's what we think, but what do you think? Do you think the citizens in Hong Kong should fight for their freedom? Do you think China will eventually completely controlled Hong Kong?
