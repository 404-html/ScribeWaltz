Speaker 1:          00:04          Two thousand and 17 is coming to an end and just before the year ends, I'd like to say a big thank you from everyone here at visual politic for joining us each and every week. Now, having said that, we want to end this year with what we hope will be the start of a tradition. So without further ado, here are the 2017 visual politic awards. First of all, just a quick note it. We decided to give out four awards because there are four of us here at visual politic. It's like let's get into the. Due to his growing leadership and strong offensive civil rights. One of the visual politic awards is for Justin Trudeau. Hi everyone. I'm Justin Trudeau.

Speaker 1:          00:56          They denied the Canadian prime minister has been one of the great protagonists of 2017 and did we can say that it's been a particularly busy year for Trudeau, a year in which this young politician has become in the eyes of the world, something of an anti trump and you're not going to give you a question. Can you stay category? Are Fake News, fake news, fake news. They are the enemy of the people this morning. Hey, we have respect for journalists in this country. They asked tough questions and they're supposed to stay in the last 12 months. His actions in the field of human rights have been quite extensive, so how about we look at some examples? Well, the prime minister kicks off the year with the welcome to Canada campaign, which aims to welcome refugees and we could say that he's really succeeded and he's made the European Union look bad at the same time because of that lack of commitments on the issue.

Speaker 2:          01:46          In recent months, Canadians have opened their hearts and their arms to families fleeing the ongoing conflict in Syria and from the moment they arrived, those 31,000 refugees were welcomed not as burdens, but as neighbors and friends as new Canadians

Speaker 1:          02:04          in 2017. He also gave honorary citizenship Canada to the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist who fights for women's rights and who has been brutally persecution and attacked by the Taliban. He has also worked as hard as we saw in the video on this channel on is integration and recognition of the indigenous people in Canada, and last but not least, in a historic speech you made before parliament last November, officially apologized on behalf of the federal government for the repression that the government's exercised against members of the lgbt community until the nineties.

Speaker 3:          02:34          We were wrong. We apologize. I am sorry. We are sorry, but

Speaker 1:          02:54          that's not all. This year, today's government has also reaffirmed its intention to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. He has also announced that the government will increase its number of residency permits so that new immigrants to the country in search of a better future. Honestly, there's not much more you could ask for in a single. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          03:13          yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Some of you might not be thinking, well, okay, okay. There's lots of civil rights stuff signed it, but couldn't this just be a distraction from the state of their economy, which really isn't working? Well, actually no, because in matters of economy, it's not actually looking at that either. The Canadian economy expects to close 2017 with three percent growth and it's the lowest unemployment rates in 10 years. Along these same lines, in 2017, Trudeau ratified his free trade agreement with the European Union is also set his sights on Asia, especially China. China will soon be the largest market in the world. It's home to 1 billion potential customers for the high quality goods and services that Canadians deliver every day. It's true that things are going slower than expected, but even so, there's a very good chance that Canada will end up becoming a great bridge between the American and Chinese economies. Yes, that is right folks, and while we may not completely agree with Justin Trudeau's agenda, we do think that he is contributing to the construction of a better world for all. So from all of us. Congratulations Justin. The next visual holistic award is for fighting when the president of Taiwan

Speaker 1:          04:41          price is a bit special in somewhat different because with we won't recognize political success, but rather the ability to resist. Allow me to explain. We decided to give this award to sighing Wang for two main reasons, first for being the first female president of Taiwan and for being a symbol to other East Asian societies. I think the young people are generally excited about this idea of hugging a woman to lead the country. I thought it was rather trending second for her from will to defense Taiwan's democracy and freedom in the face of Beijing's desire for reunification because let's not forget that this country has one of the most flourishing and alive democracies in the region, and China, as you may know, is a dictator

Speaker 3:          05:22          to share

Speaker 1:          05:26          2017 has been a difficult year for the islands and for its presidents. China has unleashed a political and economic war against Taiwan, the likes of which has not been seen for years. There's all resulted in presidents size, refusal to commit to the so called 1992 consensus and agreement under which China is recognized as a single mom. And of course if is clear it, that all this economic and political pressure poses a huge problem for this country. Forty percent of its exports currently depends on mainland

Speaker 4:          06:04          China,

Speaker 1:          06:07          however, the viewer fall from surrendering, citing when this government has reinforced it's political strategy to sync and consolidate alternatives to China, mainly opening the Southeast Asian, Australian, and New Zealand markets. This is known as the new southbound policy and so far the results have been pretty good. Trade with these countries is growing strongly at rates of seven percent at the time. Taiwanese economy is also regained some vigor and investors have regained confidence in this country. This has resulted in quite a bit of pressure on China so well even though we don't like some of the things about this. Governments such as their slowness, when facing reforms, we really believe that their spirits of resistance to Chinese pressure justifies this truck.

Speaker 3:          06:56          Yep.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Fiction with Beijing may not be most convenient for the islands interests, but I think we need to make two things clear. First, when we talk about resistance, we're talking about protecting one of the most democratic and liberal regimes in Asia and seconds according to polls. This policy is clearly backed by Taiwanese society. Due to all of this in when gets one of this year's visual political wards, so let's continue and this next award, it doesn't just go to one politician, but it goes to an entire political party and this would be the check pirate parties

Speaker 4:          07:36          zero,

Speaker 1:          07:40          and so now you might be wondering, well, why are we giving this award to the check pirate? Because they came in third in the track, parliamentary elections that occurred this year, being the second most voted for pirate party on the planet, only surpassed by the Icelandic pirate

Speaker 3:          07:56          posy

Speaker 1:          08:00          to be answered here is, well, what does the Pirate Party stands for? Wealthy pirates ideology, or as they call it, the pirate movements. There was born in Sweden in the year 2005. They wanted to protect online privacy and to reform copyright laws. This is why they're called the pirate party according to them. Copyright laws are needless barriers for entrepreneurs can only help big corporations.

Speaker 3:          08:22          Okay,

Speaker 1:          08:24          so just hold on a second year because I know what you're thinking now. Does this mean that we add visual politic are against copyright and Intellectual Property Law? Well, far from it because the truth is that the pirate movements, it has changed a lot since 2005. Now their manifesto covers far more than what it started with from economic foreign policy.

Speaker 3:          08:41          See, there's

Speaker 1:          08:44          now a big difference between the pirate parties in different countries. Just like a Swedish social democrat is totally different from a Spanish Social Democrats and Icelandic pirate is seldom similar to a check pirate so well did the check pirate stand for first of all, tech lovers as they are, they want to implement e-government solutions in the same vein as Estonia. It really makes absolutely no sense that today in the 21st century, you need to wait in line for more than four hours in an administrative office in order to report that you changed your residence. This happens today in the Czech Republic and because I live here, this is something I've had to do and it is an enormous pain in the ass and isn't this kind of bureaucracy madness. It is not only time consuming, but it's also a big share of the government's budget is stonier has saved millions thanks to these reforms and they should be a model for other countries plus the check pirates. They stand for freedom of movement, freedom of speech and fiscal responsibility. During their campaign, they avoided the temptation of promising more spending or giving grants to anyone which was especially alluring in an election full of populist candidates and on top of all that, all the ones that legalize weed

Speaker 1:          09:54          with this program, the check pirates came in third in one of the Czech Republic's most notable elections in history. Usually in most countries that are two or three main political forces, but not anymore in the Czech Republic. First place went to Anodea lip and their leader Andre Babish, but he only obtained the less than 30 percent of the vote after him is the sense of rights ods party who made up the little more than 10 percent below those with almost the same percentage. There aren't pirates, the virus, the past, other charismatic and radical politicians like the communist party and Mr Tom, Joachim Mira and anti immigration candidates. Just as a funny note, Mr Nakamura is actually originally from Japan, so when walking around Prague, during the elections, you could see a big picture of a Japanese dude which says, say no to immigration. It was actually pretty funny. So in other words, the check pirates have obtained surprising results with a solid and rational manifesto. Some of their proposals certainly better than others, but in general, they deserve our applause. Sire criteria. Lemon nosheen Paretsky. Last but not least, the fourth award, because he couldn't be left out of this list, goes to

Speaker 5:          11:08          Emmanuel macron make our planet.

Speaker 1:          11:18          You said that Mr Macron, here's one of the biggest surprises of the year. First of all, you had to create his own political party from zero. Yes. You heard that right? He started his political career as the finance minister in the social democratic government of manual valves, but he was not affiliated with that party. He was an independent. It's hard because of his achievements working in the finance industry.

Speaker 5:          11:38          I want France to be a thought that nation meaning both a nation is that we end for the startups, but also a nation that thinks and moves like a and make

Speaker 1:          11:54          no mistake here. He has not had an easy job. France has been in crisis for years. As we said in this other video. The country used to be one of the world's biggest economies, but now it's companies find it hard to compete in the international markets. Part of this is due to the economic policies. The truth is that for decades, France, fully the ideology of Charles de Gaulle man who led the country's economy as if it was an army. The goal was obsessed with protecting French companies from the outside world, but the world is different today and macron wants a 180 degree shift from this French economic theory.

Speaker 1:          12:36          His manifesto. It was solid and it was rational. He didn't promise any of those things which are impossible to achieve once you are in office and despite all of this, you won by a landslide victory. And that's not only in the presidential elections, but the parliamentary ones too. And if this wasn't impressive enough, he also did it against Marine Le Pen, the champion of European populism prior to the foundation of Mr macrons party or marsh pollsters said Le Pen had the victory guaranteed. But macron prove them wrong. Now we just asked him not to disappoint us in 2018. And in the meantime, congratulations. And annual.

Speaker 3:          13:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:13          These were the 2017 visual political wards. I hope you enjoyed them. And just before I say goodbye today, I did want to wish you a happy 2018 and thank you for joining us every week on this channel. So to everyone watching, have a fantastic 2018 and I'll see you next year.
