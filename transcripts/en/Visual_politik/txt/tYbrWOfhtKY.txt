Speaker 1:          00:00          New Zealand's is a remarkable country with little more than four and a half million inhabitants in a surface area of 268,000 square kilometers. It is a little bit smaller than Japan or Italy. It is located in the South Pacific and we could say it in New Zealand is fall from, well literally everything because even though it feels like it's right near Australia by looking at the map, these new countries are separated by more than 1000, 600 kilometers. Absent that closest. This is why we can find that endemic species such as the Kiwi and non-flying, nocturnal birds. Being such an isolated country, New Zealand has managed to become the following, a rather unique model. One of the countries in the welds enjoying is one of the highest standards of living. In this first video, we're going to tell you about some of the most striking keys to New Zealand's success.

Speaker 1:          01:03          There is an entrepreneur comments or feeling if you wish, which takes place over and over again. Every time someone is asked about New Zealand's after a visit, they all sing it as a country of congeniality and his quality of life, that country that everyone seems to want to go back to you. I'm happy to say categorically that I have found no other country that aligns more with my view of the future. The New Zealand Peter Teal, so if something is for sure, it is that New Zealand is above all a welcoming integrating country. So how about we look at a piece of evidence for that? Well, do you consider this one out of four of New Zealand's inhabitants has been abroad and here sign language is considered an official language. This isn't certainly have plenty of reasons to be happy and more than satisfied. Further New Zealand is one of the top five safest countries in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Its economy is the third freest on the entire planet and according to the doing business ranking, it is the number one country in the world when it comes to the ease of doing business. Yep. You heard that right? New Zealand dethrone Singapore as easiest place to do business. Both for this. It's not the end of our story today, not even close. New Zealand is also considered the least corrupt country in the world along with Denmark. Employment rates here are higher than the average and the OACD, and it has excellent educational, sanitary and cultural systems. In other words, New Zealand is both an economic and social success story, but leaving all of that aside. In this video, we're going to focus on one of the most distinctive keys to its success, and that's the countryside. New Zealand of land a farm using is the only developed country where the primary sector has become more relevant in the last three decades. This sector represents today almost seven percent of the country's economy

Speaker 2:          02:55          see

Speaker 1:          02:56          highlights. Just quite how much of this is consider the fact that primary sector is just one point six percent of the economy of the European Union. Four Times less than New Zealand's even Spain who's primary sector represents, so there's are more than two percent of its economy and is considered. The Orchard of Europe looks pretty ridiculous when compared to the country that we're discussing today. There is simply no equivalence in the entire world. For example, milk and dairy here are the largest exports from New Zealand. In fact, if we add goofy primary sector to the Agri food industry, these two represent 60 percent of the nation's trade exports. I really thought this could be possible that the countryside could be the main economic engine in the country with one of the best welfare systems and standards of living on the entire planet. So it is quite simply rather amazing. The agricultural competition here is so high that they even managed to achieve this without having to rely on governmental subsidies. Consider the difference. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:08          The European Union grants agriculture and livestock subsidies worth around 21 percent of total

Speaker 1:          04:14          production.

Speaker 3:          04:17          The European Union has foreseen that they will have to give 55 billion US dollars in farming support between the years 2014 and 20,

Speaker 1:          04:28          and don't be thinking that the American system is any difference now. All right, so in North America it subsidies are a bit lower than they are in the EU, but they all still around eight percent of all agricultural production. Well, that's a loss. Now, New Zealand does have some government subsidies, but they aren't just zero point nine percent of production, which is 23 times less than the European Union and to almost 10 times less than the United States. Not Bad, right? Besides, if this wasn't enough, New Zealand spending is mostly bound for investments and innovation as you can seeing thanks to save a great deal, but this hasn't always been the case.

Speaker 3:          05:14          Roger nomics and the New Zealand or farming

Speaker 2:          05:17          Lucia

Speaker 1:          05:20          in the early 19 eighties, almost 40 percent of farming income came from government subsidies at the time the national economy. It was the archetype of protectionism and the system. Well, we didn't exactly work the economy over the country. It was going through a tough crisis.

Speaker 2:          05:36          The public

Speaker 3:          05:38          deficit was enormous. Almost 10 percent of the national GDP. There was double digit inflation. The external debt and unemployment kept rising and the economy was in a state of Texas

Speaker 2:          05:47          nation. Now,

Speaker 1:          05:49          in 1984, the economics minister of the recently elected Labor governments, Roger Douglas, started and ambitious reform program known as Roger Nomix in this program. At many areas of the economy were liberalized and this included the primary sector and these changes took place almost overnight. Price controls were eliminated and most farming subsidies were removed.

Speaker 1:          06:11          Furthermore, in order to fight inflation, the government decided to raise interest rates. This was really unpopular and farmers were angry since they'd gone into debt. In previous years. It was the perfect storm income falls, debt interest spending increases, and there was a fall in the price of lands. As you can imagine, this change wasn't easy and it all seemed to indicate a future disaster. However, the country soon felt the benefits of putting an end to subsidization. The income fully encouraged farmers to look the innovations capable of raising the levels of production. They introduce new crops, improve the quality of their current crops, and used more ecological farming methods. They simply have to find a way to stand out from the crowd. On the other hand, they began to be very careful about cost and it wasn't just about maximizing the production of subsidized products. They had to improve the value chain, adapt to consumers and reduced costs.

Speaker 1:          07:03          Let's consider an example. Subsidizing fertilizers. Had resulted in the careless use of them when there were no more subsidies for these fertilizers, the use of fertilizers fell without affecting production. Farmers learns to only use them whenever necessary, which helps with the cost of production, but also helps the environment. The same happens with other things and this created a more efficient and sustainable agricultural system when we consider the new crops and products that New Zealand started producing. Theory is probably no better example than that of the wine industry. The space dedicated to two vineyards has almost tripled in the last decade, and New Zealand wine has become known around the world. More over with the goal of finding new revenue sources. The rural population started to develop additional businesses like rural tourism or elaborate agrifood products, both closely relying on environmental preservation and a highly valued brands. This meant that the farmers started to commit to the protection of the environment. Now has realized that preservation of the ecosystem was also profitable in economic terms. The results of this well, it was an incredible revolution.

Speaker 3:          08:15          In the end, only 800 interests, one percent of all of them had to close down and in the next 20 years after 1986, the production in this sector grew by 40 percent.

Speaker 1:          08:28          Pay Close attention to that figure. Since the removal of subsidies, the primary sector has grown more than the rest of the economy.

Speaker 3:          08:36          Nineteen 86 and 2006. The primary sector had sustained growth of five point nine percent per year.

Speaker 2:          08:50          New Zealand

Speaker 1:          08:51          really has thrived after the removal of subsidies, along with this internalization is also key and let them Use Zealand's countryside competitively export more than 90 percent of its production. And in addition to all of that, it's all incredibly environmentally friendly. So I mean, what else could we possibly ask for New Zealand Dfu up? It's the perfect example of how bad policies and subsidization can damage innovation, diversification, and productivity, while at the same time creating a burden for the public economy. This is exactly what is happening with the CIP, the European protectionist agricultural policy, which costs around $50, billion euros every single year. On the contrary, New Zealand shows that by doing things right, it is not only possible to save a lot of money, but at the same time it's possible for rural areas to improve substantially. New Zealand has absolutely proven that farming can prosper without public aid and while New Zealand is trying to double that falling exports by 20, 25 for the rest of the country's.

Speaker 1:          09:50          I'll still involved in the debate around subsidization, but that's our opinion here at Fisher politic and we'd love to know what you think. Do you think the countryside will die without public aid, New Zealand's success? Could it be replicated somewhere else? Well, we'd love to know what you think.
