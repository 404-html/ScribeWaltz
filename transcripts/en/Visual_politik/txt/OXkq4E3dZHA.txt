Speaker 1:          00:08          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          that was stated by the famous Harvard University economics professor Edward Glaeser cities czar, one of humanity's great creations. Cities. They make us retro greener, healthier, happier. If you are, over time, cities have become a synonym for freedom and prosperity. Of course, they are in precisely a new phenomenon since human beings stopped wandering from place to place in search of food. About 10,000 years ago, they began to build settlements that over time became cities and it was finally in the third millennium BC. The great city states began to emerge in the Mesopotamian region. City is like, oh my gosh, Umar and it's the most popular one. Babylon today, 5,000 years later, more than half of the world's population lives in cities, and by the way, more than 500 of those cities have more than 1 million inhabitant. There's no doubt about it. The Great Take off of urbanism happens in the 19th century with the industrial revolution. Since then, we've lived in a state of constant urbanization, a process that has so far in deodorants switch. While it doesn't look like it's going to stop anytime soon. See, the United Nations predict that by the year 2050 almost 70% of the entire world's population will live in cities. What began in what we now know is developed countries and since the mid 20th century extended to developing countries has led to a world dominated by huge metropolises.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Well, one second. Well, what exactly is the influence of big cities? She wants him revealing facts. Well, here they are. It's estimated that only the 600 most dynamic cities in the world where 23% of the planet's population lives generates 55% of all economic activity in a few years. That figures is going to exceed 60% in other words, our wells and our way of life depends more and more on cities. Cities off of the World Watch Messi might be if a boss Ilona, and this is a new phenomenon, has emerged from this huge evolution, and that's mega cities. These are metropolises with more than 10 million inhabitants nowadays. There are no less than 43 of these on the planet and so check this out. They all the places that are growing the most in developing countries,

Speaker 2:          02:31          and this presents a huge challenge. In fact, it causes so many problems that it's setting off major alarm bells allow me to explain. In the poorest countries in the world, cities are growing at a frantic and completely uncontrolled pace, which is generating very high levels of pollution, crime as chaotic traffic. Many of the new mega cities, they've simply devolved into chaos. For example, check out these headlines from air pollution closes all schools in Tehran. New Delhi is once again the most polluted city on earth. At this point, you might have several questions. Where will the most populated cities in the world be in a few decades? What would be their future? And most importantly, what challenges do these new mega cities face? Well, let's see. New Giants,

Speaker 2:          03:25          I'm sorry. Then unfortunately I have an assignment for you. You're going to need to learn and remember some new city names because folks, most of the new mega cities, they arms even household names. Yet a recent study by the Ontario Institute of Technology as indicators for the, by the end of this century, we can expect the largest cities not to be places like Tokyo, Mexico City, New York, but rather legos can Shasta and Dar es Salaam. Yes, you heard that right? Future mega cities will be among other places in Africa. Surprise. While you shouldn't be at least if you follow visual politic regularly on this channel, and we've already mentioned several times how the African continent is changing.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Did that study by the Institute of Technology of Ontario, these three cities located in Nigeria, the Congo in Tanzania, which are expected to be the largest cities in the world, could surpass the 75 million inhabitant mark by the end of the century. 75 million people is a truly enormous figure. If this happens, just one of these cities would have more inhabitants than all of Germany today.

Speaker 1:          04:30          You

Speaker 2:          04:30          crazy, right, but hold on a second because we really don't need to go that far into the future. It's estimated that by the year 2050 and that's really not that far away. If the five largest metropolitan areas on the planet will be these places, check it out. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Three

Speaker 2:          04:46          Lindsay, I wanted Bangladesh ends another in the Congo. The largest of all of them will have more than 40 million inhabitants. Now, as you can imagine, this poses a great deal of challenges. If today, many of these cities already have huge problems, imagine what it will be like in a few years. Let's see exactly what we're dealing with here. The challenges

Speaker 2:          05:12          folks, the case of Legos, Nigeria as larger city, it's actually kind of amazing. In the 1960s this city barely had 180,000 inhabitants. It looked like a small western style coastal town and it was surrounded by small villages. Today it's got more than 20 million inhabitants and it's simply when you stop growing according to an existing estimates, this city is destined to become the most populated place on the planet. By the end of the century, it could have more than 90 million inhabitants, but there's an important point when we talk about mega cities. It's normal to think of huge skyscrapers, super imposed transport systems into gigantic avenues. However, today in most cases, the reality is very, very different.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Sorry,

Speaker 2:          05:54          Z with more than 20 million inhabitants. Sligo since become a collapsed labyrinth of cars and motorcycles, a place where power outages or frequence and public services such as water supply and waste collection and treatments when they exist, fail more often than a silicon valley startup. And of course most of the population they live in crowded, substandard housing and others in misery because of course this excessive city growth, it poses two kinds of problems. One directly related to infrastructure ends. Can the other with the social and political consequences that didn't involve

Speaker 3:          06:30          managing a city in excess of 50 million inhabitants, is it daunting task, especially as many of these cities are woefully under serviced today? 65 years is a relatively short timeframe with regard to urban infrastructure. Much of it, for example, London Underground and brome streets as long lived and can take decades to develop. Daniel Horn wag and Kevin Pope

Speaker 2:          06:51          see recently a United Nations study about Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, and one of the fastest growing cities in the world. Documents at a myriad of problems related to waste management's according to this study, garbage piles up in the streets and drainage problems and generating all kinds of infectious outbreaks. Another study also from the United Nations warns that in Mumbai, the second most popular city in India is one that exceeds the 20 million and the habits and barrier, but substandard housing and shacks are crowded on top of one another and the streets aren't even finished, and in many cases, they're not even paved. Making them flood in the monsoon season, which doesn't do any calls, huge amounts of destruction, but the water ends up stagnating and spreading diseases. Then there's the pollution. Many of these cities are among the most polluted in the world and we already saw in a previous video just how much wealth and pollution are related and the problems they don't end there. This uncontrolled growth is also forcing a large part of the population to live in neighborhoods and areas where they don't only lack of basic services, but also important institutions like the police. This is something that favors the spread of Matthews and all kinds of criminal and radical groups. That's precisely what mega cities like San Pablo, Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City are experiencing folks in sale now. The great metropolises of always been a source of wealth and prosperity that of course there's no reason to think that it's going to be any different this time around. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          08:14          No country in the industrial era achieved any significant economic growth without urbanization. Cities concentrate poverty, but the also represent the main hope for getting out of it. You end state of the world population 2007 right report.

Speaker 2:          08:28          Okay. Cities have always been the center of knowledge, technological and artistic advances and new ideas. Even at the political level, people who live in cities. I've traditionally had a more open vision and I've been more tolerance and receptive to change. However, with the emergence of these new mega cities in a world of cities, it looks like we're facing a challenge with two possible outcomes. First that these new urban giants will bolster the local economy, generate new ways of creating wealth, promote civil liberties, and in the end be seen as the equals of cities like Tokyo, New York,

Speaker 1:          08:58          London.

Speaker 2:          09:04          The second outcome is that these cities will continue to grow in population without any substantial infrastructure improvements and that case the sum of misery, pollution and violence because ended up creating new radical politicians or driving new refugee waves towards the more developed countries. Well, I'm sure you're not surprised, but we on this channel like to think that it will be the first. We'd like to think that these new mega cities will contribute to a better world in the near future as well as in the long term, but for that they won't only need solidarity and to aid above all, they're going to need a lot of investments anyways, folks will be looking forward to all of these changes and I really hope you enjoyed this video.
