Speaker 1:          00:07          Let us start two days video with having a look at a question. If you could choose between living like the richest and most powerful person in the world, save three or 400 years ago and say, ah, like George Washington or living today as a normal middle class person from a country like New Zealand, Denmark, or Canada, well, which one would you choose? Well, many of you watching right now might be tempted to choose all of that power and influence. Right? Well, if you chose that option, my dear friends, I don't think you have thought it through quite enough. Okay. Allow me to explain. Choosing one of those historical super fourteens would involve giving up basic things like AC, internet, mobile phones, movies, pizza hands. Well, a whole other number of things that are indispensable in our lives today. Like pizza.

Speaker 2:          00:59          No,

Speaker 1:          01:01          no, as of course, then there's the fact that you'd have to deal with a much, much shorter life expectancy. For example, let's take a look at the description that economists, Xavier Salah, El Martin made of Mansa Musa, the first of Molly's life, who at current prices would be considered the richest person of all time. It took several months for a Mansa Musa to travel the 5,000 kilometers that separate molly from Mecca on horseback, a trip that my modern plane, I take about six and a half hours. His palaces had no air conditioning, no access to Google and his children can play with a playstation or we communicate with his colleague, the Sultan on a series of Cairo, Mansa, Musa, I know whatsapp, facebook or mobile phone. Of course, he was never able to cure a headache with an aspirin and I don't think that 100 years ago things were really much better and that's fine. John Rockefeller, the well known oil magnates couldn't even watch television and listen to the radio or use antibiotic. These luxury is simply did not exist. Yes, that is absolutely right. If it is me making this decision on, you know what I would choose, I would absolutely choose a current middle class life.

Speaker 2:          02:20          Indeed

Speaker 1:          02:21          I would avoid going back to the past as much as I possibly could because saying things were better back then simply isn't.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Of course

Speaker 1:          02:28          all of this shouldn't really surprise you either. After all innovation, technological development, they've always been the main drivers for improving people's quality of life

Speaker 2:          02:37          picture and sound coming together. It's just like that. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:44          regarding this, I do have some good news for you and also unfortunately I've got some bad news. The good news is the all evidence suggests we are on the threshold of a new era of revolutionary changes, changes that only seems possible in science, novels, previous

Speaker 3:          03:00          slate

Speaker 1:          03:02          and trucks that drive themselves. Biotechnology, robotics, nano technology, artificial intelligence for simply the ability to share knowledge on a massive scale through the clouds. These are just a few of the huge changes that are absolutely going to be coming. The bad news is that several experts state that both the speed and depth of these changes have been slowing down for decades. This means, but all of these technological miracles could take a long time to arrive or actually might never even arrive at all.

Speaker 2:          03:36          The big rake.

Speaker 1:          03:40          The last 20 years of the 19th century and the first 50 of the 20th century for something like a golden age of innovation. The changes that occurred in those few decades was so great that even today they seem like magic. See, many technologies were developed in those times such as the automobile, airplanes, antibiotics, electricity, nuclear energy, insecticides, and many, many, many more things that really did change people's lives forever. With all of these changes in a little more than 50 years, humanity has stopped riding on horses and found themselves able to travel to the moon. Things into perspective. Let's have a look at the airplanes evolution. This went from being something like this at the beginning of the 20th century to something like this in the 50 [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          04:39          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:41          let's take a look at how cars changed. This is how they were at first and then this is how they were in the 1950s no mama.

Speaker 2:          04:50          Oh good.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Do you guys are gene?

Speaker 2:          04:59          We could

Speaker 1:          05:00          even mentioned the microwave. It's technology that in a short time went from being a theory to being used in large rate panels and in virtually every

Speaker 2:          05:08          kitchen.

Speaker 1:          05:12          The electricity. We went from candles to light bulbs and in a short amount of time communications went from carrier pigeons to the First Telegraph and the telephone. It came soon after that. In other words, we are talking about eight spectacular rates of technological developments since then. Let's just say that things they've improved but not really so much

Speaker 2:          05:37          playing planes.

Speaker 1:          05:38          They are basically still the same. Now they are safer and they are more comfortable, but it's still the same technology. In fact, we could say that the only field where several disruptive innovations have occurred has been in the digital world. So now for you, the only question we really need to answer is, well, what actually happens? Why are things going full steam in the digital wells and not so much in the other fields? Well, some people like Peter Teal have a clear idea why I'm check this out.

Speaker 4:          06:07          We've had a lot of innovation in computers, information technology, Internet, mobile, Internet in the world of bits, not so much in the world of Adam's supersonic travel space, travel, new forms of energy, new forms of medicine, new medical devices, et cetera. I would say that we lived in a world in which bits were unregulated and Adams were regulated. Peter Teal.

Speaker 1:          06:30          All right, sir, said, wait a minute. Is Pizza deal saying that some bad regulations are holding innovation back? Well, you know he's not actually the only one who's saying this. Many experts argue the innovation has been facing what can be called an almost a perfect storm for years. This is a storm composed of, among other things, excessive regulations, patterns and way too much

Speaker 2:          06:54          predict

Speaker 1:          06:56          post. When we talk about holding innovation, we need to know we are talking about nothing all ask the whole thing progress. We are slowing down technologies that could greatly improve our lives from taking planes in space to the cure for yeah,

Speaker 2:          07:10          cancer paralyzed by fear.

Speaker 1:          07:22          Yes, so it is true. Regulations do aim to improve safety and the quality of life for citizens, but intentions are one thing and results. That's something completely different. Politicians often forget that regulations also have negative consequences and of course if there are a lot of regulations, consequences can be quite negative. Let's take a look at, for example, what is happening in the pharmaceutical research industry in the European Union, which is of course a world leader in Samsung regulations. No, how important medical and pharmaceutical research is and how it can improve our lives. Well, these huge regulations because the development of new medicines to take more than 10 years and we're not only talking about the time it takes for laboratories, do comply with all the regulations here, even after they finally obtained authorization from the European medicines agency, if they still have to wait one more year to launch their product into the market simply because of bureaucracy. Of course, this all has pretty major consequences for one, they on greatly to lengthy innovative process, which is extensively based on past experience for another. They make research incredibly expensive. We're talking about 10 or 12 years investing a lot of money without the chance of earning anything right

Speaker 1:          08:42          now. Of course, prudence and ensuring safety is absolutely important, but 10 to 12 years because of excessive bureaucracy. I mean maybe that playing it a bit too safe here.

Speaker 5:          08:51          Okay. And there's

Speaker 1:          08:53          another detail that we absolutely cannot here. The monopolization that in some way all these regulations create for big pharmaceutical multinationals. Yes, you heard that, right. Those who benefit the most from this hyper regulation are precisely the large pharmaceutical companies themselves.

Speaker 2:          09:13          Of course,

Speaker 1:          09:13          if small authorities can't cope with all these costs in the market is changing less because there's less innovation to the large companies have a secure, large and stable. Yeah, and the pharmaceutical industry, this is just one example. Let me reiterate here because I don't want to be mistaken. Regulations are absolutely important, but we need to be very careful about piper regulation because when we pile on too many demands, we increased prices and we hope the progress that improves people's lives the most, which is of course

Speaker 6:          09:43          innovation. Who gets it? Who gets to write the regular regulations? The bureaucrats, right? The regulations, but who writes the laws? The lobbyists have controls, so it's a lobbyists from the drug industry has control of writing. The regulations.

Speaker 1:          10:03          Example of the, of all of this is mobile technology. Did you know that this technology was first developed in the 1940s yeah, that's right. Mobile communication, it's really not as new as it seems and the 1940s the mts mobile telephone service began to be developed. It was a standard. They use radio waves to connect to a landline with a mobile phone, but of course now you may be wondering, well, why the hell did it take so long for this technology to mature? I mean, at the end of the day, the first modern mobile phones didn't appear until the late eighties I didn't become popular until the late nineties well, the answer to view at comes from political class and regulations.

Speaker 6:          10:39          If we are to ignore the cost of regulations, if we are to ignore the relationship between regulations and job loss, there is basically no limit to the fervor and ferocity that will be unleashed by bureaucrats who's perpetual mandate is to regulate. See

Speaker 1:          10:56          the US federal communications commission and managers by law and grants licenses to the so-called radio spectrum. This is how electromagnetic radio frequencies are transmitted. That is the signals that allow for telecommunication. Well, when companies were investing in developing mobile technology back in the 1950s the federal communications commission, which is after all a political body, decided that all mobile phones technology wasn't very important and that the radio spectrum, how to be used to boost another nascent technology television. The idea here that television was indeed much more useful.

Speaker 6:          11:36          Totally. I'm fantastical. I'd met all know all the PV industry.

Speaker 1:          11:40          Now, this is something that today we can debate, but the fact is that a large part of the spectrum was assigned to television so much more than was actually needed. That means that those technologies could have been developed at the same time, but the regulator simply did not see a future in mobile communications. That's not it. In in 1973 in motor read, the Vice President Marty Cooper, who is considered the father of mobile phones to make the first call with one of these devices that we all use today. Yes, you did not miss any of that date. The first mobile phone call actually happened way back in the 1970s but once a game, the regulator intervened and decided that competition wasn't possible in mobile telephones and assigns the entire monopoly to a t. And. T.

Speaker 2:          12:23          Yes,

Speaker 1:          12:24          I think we can say that politicians and regulators didn't hit the market tool and ended up delaying the development of mobile communications by more than 40 years. All right, so that was the case in the United States, but in Europe things they were also going down a similar

Speaker 2:          12:43          entity

Speaker 1:          12:43          for you. Think about it, it's actually quite normal because research and innovation are for scientists and entrepreneurs and not for politicians. In fact, this is the problem. Many public r and D programs face who cannot work because their work is determined by politicians and by bureaucrats are visual politic. We've already discussed how governments can play a prominent role in research development and investing, but need to do so while being aware of their limitations. This is actually what has happened in Israel as we saw with, he yells in my program, which gave leadership to investors, entrepreneurs and scientists who worked in a competitive market. If this isn't done, programs and public aid can actually be really counterproductive. They can raise the costs of r and D and I hinder startups progress and ultimately holtz technological developments and innovations, which are the best ways, as we've mentioned, to improve everyone's quality of life.

Speaker 1:          13:38          All right, well, having settled with that, now it's your turn. Which countries do you think are going to lead the future of the technological race?
