Speaker 1:          00:07          Bangladesh is the only country with an Islamic majority whose president is a woman. Her name is Shankar on ads. This is not a literal example. We're talking about the third biggest Muslim country with more than 160 million inhabitants. Nonetheless, there is one Bangladeshi, even more famous than shake Asina. This is Mohammed, you know, sees the Nobel Peace Prize winner as well as the inventor of micro credits is also from Bangalore

Speaker 2:          00:30          Dash.

Speaker 1:          00:36          This is surprising given that in this country, only at one out of every three citizens has a bank accounts. It's like Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing economies of the last few years. They have reduced poverty faster than anyone else and they are also the world's second largest textile manufacturer, only surpassed by China. But despite all of that, most of the Bangladeshi people still keep them money at home. So now you might be wondering, well, why is this, what exactly is going on in Bangladesh that causes people not to trust the bank?

Speaker 1:          01:10          Well, the answer to this, well, it's religion. According to Islam. Lending money with interest is a sin and 90 percent of the Bangladeshi people are Muslim, but wait just a minute here because things are changing in the last few decades, Muslim countries have created a system that allows saving and lending money, which also meets that Islamic principles. Yes, dear viewer. We are talking of course about Islamic banking, a phenomenon that is becoming more and more important in Bangladesh, and you might think that this is great news for the governments of shakers scene of rice. Well, in fact, the opposite is actually true.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Islami back Bangladesh is most watched bankers, so now the question becomes why does the government of Bangladesh distrust Islamic banking? And it's more importantly, what role might Islamic banking having the future of Bangladesh? Well, today we're going to answer those questions, but before we do, let's answer the most important question of all Islamic banking all about. Okay, so imagine we have a thousand American dollars and they're just sitting in a savings accounts are western bank can give you an interest rate of say, three percent. Now unsure. Many of you have wondered, well, how is it possible that a bank just gives us money for money that is simply sitting in it, but where's the profit here? Well, the truth is that that a thousand dollars, it's not just staying in the bank safe. Instead they use that money to lend to companies and individuals. Those lanes, they simply have a higher interest rate so the bank makes money and gives us little sheriff that profits. This is the basic mechanism of the entire system of western

Speaker 2:          02:40          banking.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Now obviously this carries some degree of risk because the bank can lose the money, but depending on the country we live in, the is forced by law to keep a small percentage of that $1,000, that percentage, it cannot be humans and it's schools. The cash ratio. Now, according to Sharia law, this system is sinful because lending money with interest is seen as unfair. Of course, there is no problem with keeping your client's money, but you simply can't lend it to anyone in economic jargon. This means that Sharia law demands a 100 percent cash ratio.

Speaker 1:          03:20          So this in summary, is the way that Islamic banks work, and I love you wondering, well, why don't exactly is the business here? Well, mainly Islamic banks will make money by two means. First, the banks charge their clients commissions for keeping the money. So instead of giving you an interest rate, Islamic banks can only give you a little symbolic presence. This president, it's called the hip Bob. Another business practice that is allowed by Sharia law is adding over costs. For example, let's say we buy a house with an Islamic bank. In this case, the bank will buy the house for us and then sell it to us at a higher price. And this price is called the mercer rocket runs. We can pay for it in installments. If for whatever reason we can't compete the payments, the bank will sell the house on the market. If they do get some profit from the selling weed, the clients can take a share of the profits. But wait just a minute here because this is not the end of the story. The current bands, banks from investing in what they considered dirty businesses such as tobacco weapons or productive. There's even a special index. The Dow Jones Islamic markets has 1400 companies from the New York stock market where Islamic banks can invest. As you can imagine, these things are becoming really successful in several Muslim countries, but well in Bangladesh, they are absolutely kicking off.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Islamic banking is growing rapidly in Bangladesh with a market share of about 20 percent. Do they vent already? AIDS banks have this kind of Bangladesh, even Western banks like Citi on starting to offer banking services for those who demand them in a country where brides are a thing everywhere Islamic banks are famous for their transparency and good practices. Islamic banks for instance, a famous of having nothing to do with the Bangladeshi government, so if you want to get a loan from an Islamic Bank, you have to demonstrate the you are a reliable clients willing to pay back your debts, but hold on a minute here because well things they are not as good as they might seem for these banks. Good Bank, bad bank, Islamic banking arrived in Bangladesh in 1983 when some Saudi and Kuwaiti hedge funds decided to create the Islamic Bank. This bank played a crucial role in turning an agricultural country into the textile powerhouse that it is today.

Speaker 2:          05:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Today clothes make up 80 percent of Bangladeshi exports and Islamic Bank is the biggest bank in the country. Nonetheless, the growth of Islamic banking in the country is not clear enough. Talk about our central bank is not giving new Islamic banking licenses. Even those western banks that once to give Islamic banking services must wait. They clean. They need to create a brand new regulations on the matter of Islamic banking. Meanwhile, the governments of shake and CIENA has send inspectors to the Islamic bank officers and they are surveying all of their movements. Government initiates a coo at Bangladesh. Has biggest bank board members receive a visit from military intelligence?

Speaker 2:          06:31          Yes.

Speaker 1:          06:34          So now you might wonder what is wrong with the Islamic banks and the governments? Well, shake a scene of claims that they are financing terrorism. As we explained in another video, Islamic terrorism is becoming a real threat to the country and many people think some of these banks might be financing terrorist groups. However, there are several reasons to make us believe that at the end of the day, this is nothing but a power struggle shake us. He loves to take things under her control and the fact that the biggest bank in the country sympathizes with the proposals of the opposition party certainly does not help. This is why on January 2017 has seen an interview, interviewed the Islamic Bank and change the board of managers by her own son. Since then, loans have skyrocketed. The Bangladesh Central Bank itself has warned that some of these loans are too risky. Meanwhile, both Saudi and Qac hedge funds that created the bank 35 years ago and now taking back their money, they simply don't think it is safe anymore, but wait just a minute because this is not the first time that shake his senior is trying to control the financial industry in her.

Speaker 1:          07:48          You want the guy we mentioned at the beginning, Muhammad Yunus. Well, he is in. Has Seen as cross as to in the year 2006 after some terrorist attacks, the Bangladeshi army organized acute Atar and created a technocratic governments. Back then, Muhammad Yunus was a favorite candidates. Do you lead that government in the end though? That didn't happen, but Hasina learned a vital lesson. Beware of the bankers. Sometimes they like to get involved in politics. This is why has seen his first priority after taking position in 2008 was to take care of Eunice. First of all, she forced him to resign as the chairman of his own bag, the grommet.

Speaker 2:          08:33          Of course,

Speaker 1:          08:33          some of our claims were true and make no mistake. Muhammad Yunus is not a perfect guy, but we're going to talk about this in another video, but as if making him resigned was not enough. Has also started a campaign to diminish his image in Bangladeshi society.

Speaker 2:          08:49          No Nobel

Speaker 1:          08:50          laureate, Eunice Got Hillary Clinton to stop web funding for Padma says Hasina. In other words, shake us. He knows how to beat her political enemies. First it was eunice, now it's the Islamic Bank.

Speaker 1:          09:10          So the question is now, do you think there is an actual connection between Islamic banks and terrorism for. Is this just an excuse made on by shake Asina in order to keep the finance industry under control? And shouldn't Bangladesh allow Islamic banks? Do you operate in the country without restrictions?
