Speaker 1:          00:00          The People's Republic of China has changed a lot since it was founded in 1949 as a hard line socialist country. So much so that if Mao himself rose from the grave, it probably fall right back into it. Yeah. In the 1970s China was a country of very, very poor farmers. Well, now it's a world superpower and economic powerhouse. No country in history has grown so fast or has gotten so many people out of poverty as China has done in the last 40 years.

Speaker 2:          00:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35          Throughout this time, this country has grown as an average rate of almost 10% per year, and most importantly almost 800 million people, more than the entire population of Latin America, Spain and Portugal have escaped poverty.

Speaker 1:          00:55          I'm pretty sure this isn't news to you or anyone else. Box. How did China manage to change? Do you think that this entire transformation was the result of a carefully drawn plan, some intricate strategy maps out spite China's leaders? Well, you viewer, I think that this story has a twist that is probably going to surprise you. So listen up. By the way, before we get into the video today, I did want to thank everyone who has been supporting us on page on in just a few days. We've got 650 have you on board helping us out in making these videos? We're right now working hardware, preparing a lot of surprises and we're going to have great stuff in store for people who are supporting us on paper. You're on consider doing it if you want. It would be cool. There's a link in the description below and let's crack on.

Speaker 2:          01:41          Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46          On October the first 1949 miles a dong proclaims the existence of the People's Republic of China. He did this from Tienanmen Square in Beijing and he did so with a very clear slogan and that was China has stood up.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:20          However, in the following three decades that reality had changed a lot. Now is rather obsessed with the ideology willing to implant the societal model that he has. In his mind, that's pretty much any cost as among other things to view where he thought the Beijing could decide everything and determine the future of everything.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Much

Speaker 1:          02:43          to produce, what to produce, how to distribute the workers, how many factories were needed, how the goods were to be distributed and production, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. And not only that, the other thing that was clear to mouth was that any dissidents was a danger that hat to be eliminated. Of course, as you can imagine, these ideas in the hands of someone with so much power and so much stubbornness certainly had consequences. Some studies estimate that during the almost 30 years that mel was the supreme leader of China. Between 50 and 70 million people lost their lives due to famine, political persecution, and absolute poverty. Yeah. And after 30 years in power, after collectivizing all of China's lands and properties and brutally persecuting millions and millions of intellectuals, academics, and anyone who wasn't comfortable with the regime, well, China was plunged into misery, cultural revolution, wrecked, devastation on the lives of millions of Chinese people. For 10 years, the nation was reduced to a state of barbarism, Shao Hahn and associate professor at China, University of Political Science and law.

Speaker 1:          04:01          I've found time, more than 80% of all Chinese people lived in miserable conditions. Famine was common. Political terror purges where the order of the day and the living standard swear comparable to that of some countries in sub Saharan Africa and all of this, while Japan and the Asian dragons of Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, we're taking off enormously. That's why we call and be surprised that when mel died in 1976 the Chinese communist party divided into three very different sectors. The radicals they'd by Jen Ching now's own widow, how gong fangs moderate reformers, and it's the most aggressive reformers led by Dang Shao Ping. Yeah. Leanne's after a lot of push and pull and often making it clear that China couldn't stay the way it was any longer. In 1978 it was the latter. The most convinced reformers who took the lead.

Speaker 2:          04:56          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:06          black cat and the white cat. Remember the questions that I asked at the beginning of the video? Well, let's answer the first one right now. How did China manage to change? It's called

Speaker 2:          05:17          yes.

Speaker 1:          05:20          In December of 1978 at the 11th congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the reformist, Dang she, I'll ping, took over the country's leadership.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Then Shannon Penn argued that the ideological utopia that had damaged China so much had to be set aside and that they needed to commit to modernization. In fact, you might already be familiar with his most famous phrase. It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, Dung shall pain, and as a viewer, that's precisely what he did for the following 10 years because if we have to say something, it's that the reforms weren't exactly very quick, but you might now be wondering, well, okay, Simon, but what exactly were their priorities? Well, from an economic perspective, we can classify the reforms into three big blocks, agriculture, industry and trade and sweat. It all began in the fields. We've already mentioned that at the time, China was fundamentally a country of peasants.

Speaker 1:          06:22          Well, the agrarian reform do you collectivize the countryside and the communes were suppressed and replaced by the usual family exploitation model. In addition, the so called household responsibility system was implemented by which many decisions Sanchez, what type of crops to plant spot investments to make what tools and get and by past from the governments, from the bureaucrats to the families themselves. And not only that, the peasants had to sell parts of their harvest to the state and then could sell the rest on the free market, a completely free prices. And that was a huge revolution. But this time the good kinds agricultural production soared and food prices dropped. Well the peasants living conditions improved a lot. I'm, the results were good. So Beijing decided to apply similar reforms to the industry sector. That way the government gradually transfer decision making from Beijing's ministries to government owned companies. Yes, the decisions where it's still coming down from the government, but let's just say they were working under different criteria.

Speaker 2:          07:26          That one,

Speaker 1:          07:26          wait, let's all buy less. All throughout the 1980s governments owned company managers were able to make decisions such as sharing benefits among workers, paying productivity, bonuses, grounding the freedom to hire and fire employees, deciding which suppliers to work with the setting free prices. And the list goes on. It makes sense because who better than the companies own managers to decide what they need to work better? Well, in addition, this was all the companies by the legalization of private companies. So suddenly the government owned companies, they had competition, and there was also a trade reform in which little by little China allowed foreign trade by largely dismantling import barriers, tariffs. However, we owns agriculture, the reforms, they did face a huge problem. China was a very poor country, and of course it has been either capital nor technology. So, well, what did the government do? Well, this gets interesting.

Speaker 2:          08:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:31          Special economic zones. Beginning of the 1980s China was a very poor country. It was close to the world, and it lacks both money and technology. Or what he did have was a large workforce willing to work in better conditions than the ones they had in the countryside. So under these circumstances, then she, our pings government decided for an experiment. They didn't want to completely renounced the economic model of it. They'd inherited from mouth, but they did want to make something so they made special economic zones in areas where the communist system had stopped.

Speaker 2:          09:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:08          In these areas, foreign companies could invest and set up factories. That is, they had access to the Chinese workforce. That in itself was a huge advantage, but that wasn't all. They also have very few taxes, relatively this will bureaucracy and some no terrorists.

Speaker 2:          09:26          It was

Speaker 1:          09:27          essentially a smaller waist for multinationals in the middle of the then hostile and Hermetic People's Republic of China. Beijing's idea was very clear. Bring technology, bring capital, bring work. Initially for special economic zones were set up. Shen Zen Zhuhai shall men and Shanto. These were so successful that the authorities began planting them all over the country.

Speaker 2:          09:49          Okay?

Speaker 1:          09:54          There's the case for example of Shenzhen, when the special economic zone was created, the area was nothing more than a poor fishing village with just over 30,000 people. Today it stands at 12 million inhabitants. It's GDP will soon as the past out of Hong Kong itself, and it's one of the world capitals of technology and it's all happens in just a few decades.

Speaker 2:          10:17          Do you know

Speaker 1:          10:17          the company is quite away Dji or 10 cents? Well, they're from this city, these economic zones. Success was so great that we can state that they were the precursors of China's opening. The shenton special economic zone is an experiment. We need more time to see whether it has gone well. We wish it success. If it fails, it will provide some lessons. Dung shopping because folks Dang shall pings. Initial idea was to use these areas, not to open up the country to gain resources so that the government could maintain the old model. It's often thought that China's transformation was perfectly drawn designs and calculated by the Beijing government. However, and this might surprise you, it wasn't like this, the marginalist revolution,

Speaker 3:          11:07          Huh?

Speaker 1:          11:09          For the Chinese reforms where plans by the Beijing governments, but where are they really?

Speaker 3:          11:16          Well? Well,

Speaker 1:          11:16          you see often Mao's death, China with a wreck. The last crusade of these so called great helmsmen. The Cultural Revolution had left the country in tatters. Mao's cultural revolution producer results opposite to what he presumably intended leading many Chinese solutions, faith in their government altogether. Frank Dakota, Dutch historian who specializes in modern China. In fact, it was during this period, the black markets began to spread places where people try to survive outside of the system. And that also meant a very important cultural change. Perhaps that's why often Mao's death before the transitions chaos, some changes began to happen automatically. For example, while the government continued to promote collectivized agriculture, some regions revolted and decided to implement this, the family exploitation system on their own, even though this manager breaking the law and returning de facto to a private exploitation systems. And of course, as this initiative started gaining more and more followers, the Beijing government finally decided to establish these changes, uh, state policies, but it was actually following these changes that caused the change in society. Something similar. It happens with private businesses in the cities you see often Mao's death. Many young people had been sent to the countryside, returned to the cities, and since there was no work, they tried to sort it out themselves and the government is simply had to accept it and suddenly private stores be under multiplied like mushrooms in every Chinese city ending the state's commercial monopoly once and for all.

Speaker 1:          12:51          And in a way, the same thing happens with the municipal and regional companies which began to emerge outside of state control. This led them to be the most dynamic in China for years. Yes, it's true. Dang shopping's government didn't stop these changes. Is it? On the contrary, he ended up implementing them as policies. But as you can see, a large part of the change, far more than what we're often told, came from the bottom up and not the top down. By the way, maybe that's why China's transformation was so great and it happens in such a short amount of time, by the way, before you go and beat us up in the comments, we do know that Sean Penn was no saint, he was a dictator. And without going much further, we can see that the tnm and repression was his own

Speaker 2:          13:31          doing,

Speaker 1:          13:33          but now it's your turn. Do you think China will ends up ever becoming a democracy?
