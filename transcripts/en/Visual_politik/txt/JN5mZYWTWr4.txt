Speaker 1:          00:07          But if you have asked us to make a video about the Mexican elections, which are arguably the most important in the history of Mexico, but why all these elections so important? Well, that's because this might be the first time in the history of Mexico that we say goodbye to by partisan politics, election polls, Lopez Obrador is 10 point nine points above his biggest rival. But hold on a minute here because Mexico isn't even actually a bipartisan country. In fact, Mexico has had the same political party in governments. Five or 70 years. Yep. You heard that right from 1930 until the year 2000. Every Mexican president belongs to the Institutional Revolution Party. Also known as P, R I from their Spanish acronym and yeah, I know what you're thinking. How can you be a revolutionary and institutional at the same time?

Speaker 1:          01:04          Well, nobody really knows, but that's the name of the party got. Theoretically, pri is a sense of left wing party or they. Many Mexicans would say that just a casual party with no clear ideology or identity. The only simply their lust for power still for 70 years, PRI was winning. Every election after the year, 2000 Mexicans took a 12 year hiatus from pri with the conservative and National Action Party, also known as pan. Then in 2012, the PRI struck back and one of the presidency with Enrique Kenya. Yes sir. A guy who now holds the title of Mexico's most hated president ever, and that is why right now with Mexico about to hold these game changing elections on June the first John says that neither the Pri and all the here and we'll win office. The front runner is this man here, Andres Manuel Lopez, Obrador.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Then a worried by the Lopez Obrador economic agenda. This is the third time he's run for office and it might be the final time, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, as Mexicans knew him, and Lo has policies that, to put it mildly scap verse out of business people and foreign investors, some people argue the Mexico might be on the brink of becoming the new Venezuela there if they choose a populist politician like him. Nonetheless, his worst enemy is not businessmen. It's actually himself. His public statements are scaring away all the moderate voters and that is a problem because they could direct all of this and um, sentiment towards one of the other candidate. That's, that's today's questions are why can ambula win this election and all that legitimate reasons to be scared of his presidency feather. We also want to look at were there any other kinds of data could really overshadow him in the election? Well, today, good news. We're going to answer all of those questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the big Mexican disappointment at the beginning of the 21st century it seems like in Mexico was taking no prisoners with plenty of natural resources like oil and Silva. Mexico was one of the most appreciated emerging economies in 2010. The country's GDP growth rate of five point five cents. Nonetheless, just like the other emerging economies of Brazil and South Africa, Mexico went from hero to zero in 2016

Speaker 1:          03:35          can GDP. In US dollars is at its worst level since 2010. This is the pricing. If we take into account that Mexico has countless opportunities to become a wealthy nation, they have oil, a good climate for agriculture and all kinds of natural resources, and even more importantly than those things, they share a border with America. As you know, Nafta is a trade agreement between Mexico, the USA and Canada, and say 80 percent of Mexican exports go to Uncle Sam. Despite all of this, Mexico is still a mid level income country with low wages and a much lower quality of life than it's northern native.

Speaker 1:          04:15          You might be wondering, well, why is this well off to 70 years of a basically one party system with corruption and drug trafficking going on? Mexico has almost medieval institutions and I know you're probably thinking right now. You're thinking, oh, Simon's exaggerating again. Well, how about you judge for yourself until the year 2016? That judicial system had no presumption of innocence, so that wasn't even a need for evidence. In order to convict someone. In many cases, a confession obtained through torture would be more than enough to send someone to jail is fitting this academic school. This, the inquisitorial judicial system added this to the drug trafficking, which has already killed more than 200,000 people in just 11 years

Speaker 2:          04:58          for

Speaker 1:          04:59          better understanding in some areas of Mexico, narcos have more power than the state itself, and political sciences is called a failed state situation and this happens in many areas of Africa and in Mexico. In other words, Mexica needed more than reforms. It needed a 180 degree turn arounds for its institutions as well. Who was the man for this job? Well, of course that would be henrique a pen. Yeah, NASA. That his job was to do this when he got into office in 2012. The problem is that it's still too early for Mexicans to notice improvements in their day to day lives after the reforms. In fact, social unrest in Mexico, it actually keeps growing

Speaker 1:          05:39          and you can add to that the thanks that Kenya and yet says, worst enemy is actually opinion yet so himself. Few people have worked harder to damage that credibility basically has everything. One needs to become a hated politician. Corruption scandals, a fake phd size and lots of embezzlement, but this apparently wasn't enough for him. Do you remember Donald Trump's election campaign and you probably do. He was messing with Mexico every other day. As you can imagine, Mexicans, they're not big fans of trump because of this. Well, Kenya is brilliant. Idea was to invite trump for an official visit even before he became the president and you can probably guess what the reaction of the Mexican people was and then we got to consider the war on drugs. Festy jailed El Chapo Guzman who was the Mexican version of Pablo Escobar. After that, El Chapo escaped from jail via written all over. It was so well built. It was obvious. It received help from the police. Say to sum things up, Kenya is the man. People love to hate a survey in Mexico. Pentagon, the anthro is the Mexican president with the worst approval rating of all time. In other words, Kenya and Yetta and administration epitomizes the public's ultimate disappointments with the Mexican ruling class. So Pri is not to be trusted. Pa and is not very exciting either. So the traditional candidates and not really an option anymore. So I mean, what's left? Well, this is where I'm low, comes in,

Speaker 1:          07:15          um, low. There was a time when emily was a member of the PRI policy that was in the 19 seventies, but this institutional revolutionary party was already more institutional than revolutionary. Then that's why I'm. I left them and created the party of his own, the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the stronghold of the true Mexican left. As you can imagine, defeating the PRI was mission impossible in Sylvia thousands that yet brought the big crash of the biggest Mexican potty. For one, they lost the presidency to the Conservatives for another, they lost the mayor of the city of Mexico to unload.

Speaker 1:          07:56          Becoming the leader of the biggest metropolol all across Latin America is not a small deal. You get a great showcase for your policies, and this is why six years later, I'm low, almost won the presidency of the country. I say, what do you do when you almost win a national election and have become the new left wing Rockstar? Well, you accused the government of election fraud and organized lots of demonstrations on the streets and the let your followers name you fee, legitimate presidents and family almost winds this time around. All of this could happen again. I said in a democracy you can win and you can lose, but this was not a democracy. Clearly the selection was unfair and full of irregularities.

Speaker 3:          08:41          He does, he of,

Speaker 1:          08:49          but now we know his history. Let's have a look at his policies. Basically, Angelo wants to undo all of the made by previous presidents. How about some examples? Well, here we have the energy, though. Prior to this little, all next oil was managed by these state company. Pemex. This company itself suffered big losses and we'll kinds of corruption cases and yet and yet so and his energy bill wanted to end this monopoly so foreign companies could invest in the country as a result. Short term wise, gasoline prices went sky high in just a few months.

Speaker 1:          09:24          Timely wants to try and solve the problem by giving back to the way things were before. The same goes for the education bill. Prior to the current Ceville teachers' unions held a lot of sway over public education. The result was lots of protests organized by those teachers unions, and again, I'm low, wants to go backwards and make those teachers happy. And what about drug trafficking? Well, Emily's plans don't stop with ending the war on drugs, which could be kind of reasonable. He wants to provide amnesty for the big drug kingpin is so called dangerous. Criminals are mere babies compared to the corrupt politicians, but the best of his policies, what we like to call his magic tricks. For example, how do we end corruption symbol? We write a so called moral constitution and remove the illegal immunity that the members of parliaments currently enjoy. This one is especially funny because it's not exactly the first time that a politician has connected those two principles of corruption and legal immunity and guess what? The least corrupt countries on the planet, Denmark and New Zealand's have legal immunity for them, members of parliament. Then again, it does seem like a very appealing policy for populist politicians worldwide.

Speaker 1:          10:38          Anyway. I'm like basically seems to have easy and quick solutions for everything. So the more examples, well, youth unemployment easy, the government will employ thousands of youngsters and so on and so forth with other such examples and other words and low and his brand new political party, the so called marina generates a lot of sympathy in half of Mexico society and a lot of fear in the other half. And this is a problem because if you want to run for office scattering, your enemies might galvanize them on election day. So the real question now is to what extent is Amarillo willing to moderate his agenda,

Speaker 2:          11:17          popular

Speaker 1:          11:18          or populist? Remember this name, Alfonso Romo. He's a big businessman in Monterrey and has been hazed by amyloid to become the campaign spokesperson. So what's his mission? Well, he's the man in charge of moderating ambulance policies and making them more palatable for independent voters. With all the polls in his favor, amyloid needs those votes badly. And Alfonso Aroma is the man for the job. He comes from the business wells and supported conservative candidates in the past. In fact, many of emily's advisors come from different backgrounds, including the conservative Pan Party. And you can really tell that they are softening rhetoric,

Speaker 2:          11:53          right?

Speaker 1:          11:56          Remember how I told you that emily wanted to revoke the energy bill? Well now with phones, say Roman was essentially said, look guys, it wasn't so that at the end of the day we'll just renegotiate the contracts with foreign companies that they can stay in the country. I'm low changed as mine and now he says yes to energy, openness according to our funds or Oromo, but there's still a lot more last minute moderation. For example, Angela is from region, Coles, Tabasco here and the other is a kind of fish cold pack. And that's why some people live in, nicknamed him the pain. So now in order to give the impression that he will not nationalized companies, raised taxes or expropriate properties in Venezuela and fashion, he's launched a brand new economic agenda called payer nomics. No money is a big fan of risks and experiments. And with or without flashy names, Mexican businessman doesn't really trust. I'm like, this is why while the elections are getting closer and closer, this group has already found it's canceled. DEB's against this Mexico and like other countries like France has no second rounds during the presidential elections. That means that the candidate with the biggest share of the voters on July the first will become the presidents, and this is why it seems that the biggest antagonist to Amarillo is going to be the conservative candidates, Ricardo and Naya,

Speaker 1:          13:17          the Mexican business elite, will support in order to stop Lopez Obrador being 39 years old, and I was the youngest candidate in this election. He's been accused of money laundering, but this hasn't actually hurt him during the campaign. In fact, quite the opposite is true. People believe that this was just a dirty trick played by the PRI to disqualify him. Seven dd is gaining momentum in the polls, although he still has a long way to go in order to pass ambler.

Speaker 1:          13:43          So now the big question is, do you believe amyloid will become the next Mexican presidents and neither can actually beat him? Is amyloid risks to Mexico or is it hard to do worse than previous presidents?
