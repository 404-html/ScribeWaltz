Speaker 1:          00:00          We've already discussed it here on visual politic margin. Tina is a country where football is practically a state religion ends. We're not a single decade goes by without at least one major economic crisis. For decades, this country has been dominated by a political model, a kind of ideology, a political current parent ism, which is something like a mix of nationalism, protectionism and public spending.

Speaker 2:          00:25          Lab another job

Speaker 1:          00:36          in 2015, and you governments arrived that have Mauricio Macri with the mission of rebuilding the country from the top to the bottom.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Joel the same vineyard go there

Speaker 1:          01:00          in the 2017 legislative elections. The Argentine people renewed that trust in this process. Basically they came to say, well, well done mackery. So the question that has recently arisen is, well, Ms Dot Argentina finally ready once and for all for takeoff. Well, let's have a look at it. Shall We? On October the 22nd 2017 elections for Congress and the senators were held in Argentina. The government in coalition can be a moss, has an overwhelming triumph with more than 10 million votes. They won 15 out of the 24 electoral districts, including the top five. These are the most populated one spinal surgeries, providence, Buenos Aires city, Cordoba, Santa Fe, and Mendoza. Something like that hasn't happened since 1985

Speaker 3:          01:50          right

Speaker 1:          01:57          now, after these elections. Can Gay is close to having an absolute majority, which ensures the government's ability to push their reform agenda forward.

Speaker 4:          02:08          No.

Speaker 1:          02:21          For this reason, several analysts have stated that this is the true beginning of term, so after two years of power, what does mackery done? What hasn't been done, and what are his intentions? You're going to find the answers to all of these questions in today's video, but before we do that, let's take a look back at the history

Speaker 3:          02:41          downfall.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Trigo. Argentina was one of the richest countries in the wells, even richer than countries like Canada, Australia, France, or even

Speaker 3:          02:52          Gemini.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Not only that, when World War Two ended in 1945, this country was along with the United States, one of the largest creditors in the world, and also one of the largest gold owners on the entire planet at that time when our salaries, the Argentine capital was in full swing and could even rival New York, but of course having said all of that, while he might not be wondering, well, what the hell happened to Argentina? Even though things didn't look bad for this country after the Second World War? The truth is that something that was already changed. Great International Crisis of the 19 thirties affected this country a lot. Argentina, which was a huge agricultural exporter, suffers and just had its first major financial crisis, and since that time, all those years ago, nothing has been the same. Six began to intervene in every economic and societal feels. Finally, in 1946, what we could call it, the definitive term where it began, the governments of General Ferrell first and then Ken or Juan Domingo, Peron approved all kinds of rules and laws more than 16,000 in fact, which puts the economy under state control, which for example meant that things like foreign trade isn't as creation or competition, wouldn't really be a priority instead of policies such as import substitution, nationalization ends, launched state enterprises. They became the order of the day.

Speaker 1:          04:32          This is how a 70 year downfall began, which made Argentina become one of the very few countries that has gone from a developed country to a developing country economic crisis. Hyperinflation and payments suspension has become very, very common problems. Talked about in the Argentinian media in recent decades, and this process culminated with coaching tourism from Christina Fernandez to cut snap man to ruin. Tell two terms. As president and Cristina Fernandez de [inaudible] set up a model that could simply be defined as uneconomical. Yeah, Argentina. It was already pretty terrible at business, but Christina, she took it a step further. See, in CFA is Argentina. There were capital controls companies, gonna repatriate their profits, taxes on companies reached in comparable proportions in Latin America. There were lots of restrictions on imports and the central bank was only dedicated to making money in order to finance the governor. The model was so terribly uneconomic that CFA at set up a lot of taxes on exports. Yes. Who would really think of punishing companies that are exporting, selling to other countries. It's pretty crazy indeed.

Speaker 5:          05:58          Going to celebrate what he saw. A ton of posts get Tina independent dealer Florida or something. I can't do it,

Speaker 1:          06:25          but that isn't all with Christina at the helm of the castle respond on the Argentina Whitehouse. This country became one of the most protectionist in all of Latin America and also a country where setting up companies was incredibly difficult and of course the results they were immediate during his second term growth was no. The public deficits sort inflation rose to 40 percent investment collapsed and suddenly, again, nothing seemed to be.

Speaker 6:          06:52          This is how

Speaker 1:          06:52          in December of 2015, the Argentinian people chose Mauricio Macri, former presidents of Boca junior as the new president of Argentina.

Speaker 6:          07:01          Tito said he didn't see me in the door. The end, the color can dino.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Yeah. Mauricio Macri is first year at leading Argentina. It wasn't easy. Of course, this was bound to happen because of the terrible state that he inherited the country and for example, he reduced electricity and natural gas subsidies, but because reforms never have immediate results, things didn't look so great at the beginning. In 2016, the country suffered a severe recession with a GDP drop of two point six percent. Inflation also approached 40 percent poverty. Unemployment deficits and external debt also increased. In other words, there were ample opportunities to criticize mackerel. I mean, wasn't he the one who promised that things were going to change?

Speaker 3:          08:04          Well,

Speaker 1:          08:05          as we said a minute ago, reforms do not have immediate results, but in the end those changes, they do arrive in 2017. The Argentine economy was finally showing signs of improvement. This year's growth may exceed three percent in the appetite for investment is already more than evidence. Yep, that's right. It looks like Argentina maybe coming out of that

Speaker 3:          08:28          tunnel. Philadelphia

Speaker 1:          08:38          being these results have given macri the great electoral victory that we've just seen. Now we come to the question of, well, what exactly did the president do? Well, basically he reduced all of the crazy regulations and policies that have been put in

Speaker 3:          08:50          place.

Speaker 1:          08:53          The new government, it seemed to work reducing these because in their eyes there was no time to lose. As soon as he arrived, he eliminated currency controls. He allowed foreign investors to repatriate their profits, the eliminated the most incomprehensible export taxes and reduce subsidies and restrictions on imports and all of this was with one clear objective, Argentina, to recover its productive economy. Also, and this is really important here, mackery reached agreements with some of the international investors that Argentina hadn't paid in 2001 and with whom it's still had judicial fights.

Speaker 1:          09:31          Tina reached an agreement with the venture funds after 14 years of struggle in total to cover all the debts with the funds, mccree offers $6,500, million dollars. This agreement implies a 25 percent. Reduction. On the other hand is the new government's approved to kinds of fiscal amnesty which brought to light new less than a hundred and $17. Billion Dollars. Intelligent Indians had a broad and did not declared, but before you think this is a huge scandal, do you think about what would happen if you were afraid that your savings could be confiscated by the government? Sometimes it's not just about not paying taxes. When states don't have legal security, it's easy for money to simply disappear. The fact is that with all these measures, macaroons, government has managed to get much of that money back to Argentina, and since then there's been an influx of money which has triggered things like real estate sales, car sales. We are breaking records. More than 700. 80,000 cars have been sold to this day and most importantly trucks. This means that production is moving. Constructionist moving. Mauricio Macri, it looks like the engine, quite literally it started again, looks organ will invest $650, million US dollars to modernize plants in Argentina,

Speaker 3:          10:48          but

Speaker 1:          10:48          one question arises and that's everything, randy. So exemplary is everything really so perfect. Well, hold on a minute because the truth is that until now the reforms have been very, very gradual than that and had a fairly limited range, something in spite of the electoral results and all those calls to uncork the champagne has alerted several experts at the moment of truth. So far he hasn't done much beyond removing kitchener ism from power, which isn't little, even though he did say that these elections are the endorsement for the reforms. We don't really know what they are, what he wants to do. Carlos Rodriguez, Braun, Argentina, economist. But why so much distrust? Because despite the reforms we've seen, it seems that this government is struggling to overcome some of the typical problems of Argentina's previous governments. For example, public spending has not decreased. It continues to rise and rise, which has caused, among other things, foreign debt to soul by more than $50, billion dollars since macri came to power and that's not all taxes are through the roof. The central bank continues to finance the government with new money as according to the latest doing business reports, which the ease of doing business in the country. Argentina is still way down in 116th place.

Speaker 1:          12:04          Now, to be fair, we can see the macro has pretty good excuses. First is that not much time has passed and second is political position in Congress in the Senate was very weak now, but after these last elections, all of that is finally over reformist agenda.

Speaker 1:          12:27          It seems that often has crushing electoral trump. President Macri has made it clear we are entering a stage of permanent reformism. Argentina doesn't have to stop. It doesn't have to fear reforms because to reform is to grow, to evolve, to progress the ratio mccree. He certainly has a task out of him, which is somewhat complicated. Well, what are his priorities? Well, fundamentally view at first, it's something that is as popular as it is necessary, reducing public deficits and controlling inflation which are ultimately related. Then he's going to get Argentina back to being a competitive and attractive country in which to invest. To achieve this, it has promised to approve a tax reform that reduces taxes on businesses and the labor reform that facilitates hiring as well as more free trade agreements. Argentina and Chile signed the most ambitious free trade agreement in 20 years. Then pension, educational, and infrastructure reforms. The next yes, we can assess and say the macro has a lot of work to do if you want us to meet the high expectations that have been placed

Speaker 7:          13:25          on him. In any case,

Speaker 1:          13:29          it does seem as if a new political and economic era has begun the entre. Tina, a good example is [inaudible] commitment to reducing poverty by formalizing and extending property to the most disadvantaged. Argentina delivers housing certificates to one point 5 million people in slums. Government will give them the documents to access water and electricity legally. By the way, we will be discussing how to find poverty in a future video. Subscribe for now. The question is, will this country become great? Once again, if they manage to deepen their reforms and take advantage of all their opportunities, it's not trans. The lithium industry, which we've discussed previously. I have little doubt that this will be the case and now we want to know what you think will Argentina become a great example for the rest of Latin America?
