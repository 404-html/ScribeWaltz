Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:08          Okay. Before we get started with today's video, I've got to give you two warnings. The first is that we might include some spoilers about narcos on via sleep or given that it's a TV show based on real history, I don't think this is so much of a problem and the second warning is that today we're going to talk about drug trafficking, a topic where the information we have is pretty incomplete and all the time police to finding new bits of information that could prove parts of this video wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:34          Tell you. That being said, let's move on to Colombia. The country that is known of the country of a thousand rhythms, the country of coffee and the birthplace of so many of those Latino singers that got the whole world to dance. Nevertheless, what really made this country famous is sadly this man [inaudible] video [inaudible] the king of cocaine, the man who basically created one of the world's most dangerous industries at the ends of the 1980s Pablo Escobar or El Patron, as his neighbors used to know him, controlled it, and 90% of the worldwide production of cocaine. Suddenly it met a Yin and a city of 2 million inhabitants became the Hollywood of cocaine. However, on December the first 1993 he died during a shootout with the police. But well, you've probably already knew that. So the question now becomes, well, what happens after Pablo who took his business? Ma'Ams then there is the most important question of all, and that is, is there still cocaine trafficking in Columbia? Well, today we're certainly going to answer all of those questions, but before we get into any of that, let's talk a little bit about cocaine.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:46          weed. Cocaine is the second most consumed drug in the world, but it's unlike the first one that cocaine is extremely hard to find marijuana. It groves anywhere on the planet, even in cold places like North America grow houses are found all the time. And with just a little bit of expenditure, anyone can create at home the optimal conditions for growing cannabis. That's coca leaves. They are a different animal. You need a very specific habitat to grow them. And this is why only some countries can grow these leaves, but the main countries are Colombia. Peru and Bolivia ship.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Cool.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Okay. In other words, there is just space for a few suppliers, but on the other hand, the demand, it won't stop growing as well. It's a gullible demands. This is why it cocaine is such a high profit business, and this is why right after Pablo Escobar's death, there were lots of people willing to take his place.

Speaker 1:          02:44          [inaudible] feel

Speaker 2:          02:46          bores. As you know, probably West Guevara was the leader of the median cartel, but even before his death, there was already a second cocaine capital, and that was the city of Cali, also in Columbia and with a very similar population.

Speaker 3:          03:00          We're Pablo left a trail of bodies and chaos. Since week Kelly May problems disappear with an army of lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs. Met Him. Cartel was Miami, swimming pools, bikini girls. Taki is a two tone cadillac. The Cali cartel was New York, elegant, smooth, subtle, where they can fuel the 24 hour night, live with cocaine and still make sure everybody showed up for work on Wall Street. The next morning, the first met Ian and Kelly works side by side, but in Colombia when money's involved, blood inevitably flows.

Speaker 2:          03:38          The Cali cartel, they wanted to take the whole of Escobar's business that many in plenty of Narcos who wants to do the same thing. One of them with Diego Fernandez, Marillo Aka dawn.

Speaker 1:          03:49          Bye now.

Speaker 2:          03:54          It helps the police deal with Pablo Escobar and made an alliance with the Cali cartel. I'd even had close ties with a right wing paramilitary group called the Colombian self defense forces with Pablo Escobar dead and buried. Don dunner started a new organization with this paramilitary group, the so called office center, Dan Vergano. At the same time, smaller narcos in metagene. We're also fighting for their share. The street you see on the screen was the border between one band. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:23          Basically,

Speaker 2:          04:24          if you were a worker for the ovc now the end de Gallo and cross the street, someone would kill you immediately. So as you can imagine that these were extremely violent times for the city, different drug bands, or killing each other pretty much all the time. Meanwhile, the Cali cartel was way more subtle. This is Gilberto Rodriguez and his partner, Pasho Herrera. They were high class buyers with plenty of contact, some on politicians and judges. In fact, Gilberto Rodriguez paid over $6 million to finance the campaign of one of the Colombian presidents anesto Santa's nonetheless, despite beautifully when it's in the corruption after sometime the inevitable happens. Yes, Sonia, I'll go. We are not. Government has started the extradition process for the chief of the Cali cartel. Nonetheless, dawn burner volunteers. He was at a totally different story among all the characters that appear on the Narcos TV show. Dawn burner is the one who has lost the longest without being put behind bars, but we're just a minute because now we can talk about in the characters that didn't appear on the show at least in the first two seasons, and to prepare yourself because, well, there's a lot to tell.

Speaker 2:          05:30          Remember how don burner was working with this right wing group? Well, the political ideology was more important than what you might think for this group. The Colombian self defense forces. They were born to fight against communist guerrillas in the country.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Collusionary

Speaker 2:          05:45          armed forces of Colombia, Fark Fark. It's more than just a simple terrorist group. In some areas of the country, they became a parallel government more than an Alpha eater kind of thing. They could be better comparison with dash or Islamic state. Even today, a good parts of the Colombian rainforest is under the control of this Marxist Leninist group. Fox, they had their own doctors, their own hospitals, and of course they collected their own taxes. This group has over 20,000 members spread across 24 of Columbia's 32 provinces. As you can imagine, Fox, they were not good friends of drug trafficking. Yes, drug traffic isn't terrorists. They do have common enemies, but the idea of becoming a millionaire by selling a product on the international market doesn't sound very Marxist. Besides extortion and kidnapping, they were pretty lucrative businesses as well as FARC. They were experts on these matters. Add to this, the fact that don burner and this office seen to and vanguard who had an anticommunist group on their site, and you can imagine that the war, it was about to happen, but with this

Speaker 4:          06:49          is the boy, Huh? Municipality. I data today, it's covered by plants and trees. That is the north, apart from where bark launched rockets to the other part of the municipality,

Speaker 2:          06:59          but well, business is business and the mass of the money for could make with kidnapping. It was hard to resist the temptation of drug trafficking. So one day Mudita [inaudible] has one of the main thought leaders decided to try in the cocaine business.

Speaker 5:          07:12          Yes.

Speaker 4:          07:16          Jean Front of the FARC went from 200 members to over 800 due to cocaine revenue, which became one of the primary ways the Koreas finance their activities.

Speaker 2:          07:26          Don't forget the FARC have the control of all the areas where coca plantations, where in fact they had already extorted the growers. Nonetheless with Medina, Caracas is leader. FARC have created their own fields and their own distribution networks. This was all happening by the year 2000 at this time, the Cali cartel, it was already dismantled, but cocaine, it was still employing a good share of the Colombian workforce.

Speaker 2:          07:53          Well, to summarize, on the one hand, we have the office sooner to envision Gado with don burner as the leader and then we have FARC on the other hands and between these two there's also a plethora of independent drug trafficking bands called the backroom. It was during this time the Columbia chosen you president's Alvara rebate. Early Bay was born in Midian and this political goal was to end all the violence am's. Well, this marks the beginning of the tox mafioso oh Volvo or rebate. Was it ready to end the guerrilla warriors and the right wing groups at any cost. This is why in the year 2005 is Defense Minister Camilo or Spina signed the law that is thought of with sadness in Colombia. This law was directive zero to nine and as well. Now you might be wondering, well, what's so sad about that? It sounds like it could be a good thing.

Speaker 4:          08:43          This directive said literally that the government would give the equivalent of 1900 US dollars to anyone who would murder a guerrilla fighter or a paramilitary, right wing fighter.

Speaker 2:          08:57          Sure. Basically, if you were a soldier in the Colombian army ends, you wanted to have a good career. All you had to do was get out and go on a man Hans, and all of a sudden, well, the death toll at Fark Ama narcos, it absolutely skyrocketed, but hold on a minute because this was just the beginning. Finding FARC members, it wasn't an easy job, but the rewards given by the Colombian government was really, really tempting. This is why a lots of soldiers started killing innocent civilians. After that, they would dress the metaphoric uniform and take a picture of the dad's body. This was enough to go to the government office and gets the money and this is something that happens way more than once or twice. There is even a name for it. In Colombia, the dad civilians were called false positives and it became a major way for people to make money in Colombia. It's still today, the Colombian justice system has over 3000 ongoing cases of false positives that need to be investigated. But wait a minute, because while the policies of presidents or rebate, we're extremely controversial, one thing has to be set. He made it way more complicated for FARC guerrilla warriors, raids on cocaine fields and distribution networks. They became the norm. And when your enemy is killing dozens of your members, you are willing to sign an alliance with the devil himself.

Speaker 4:          10:13          Some emails prove the links between the FARC and the narco traffickers and one of the messages and Middle Kaneko Oh Korea leader shows a clear connection with the OPC and the end of the Godell.

Speaker 2:          10:30          As we said before, fuck would present at all the plantations. In some cases, those plantations, they belonged to the office scene to end Gatto or some belongs to the back room that we mentioned earlier. On the other hand, sometimes patients were managed directly by fog. These aren't where they grew and processed cocoa leaves and turns them into white powder. Then the big cartels steps into distributes the cocaine to other countries. Nonetheless, unlike the times of Pablo Escobar, Colombian cartels and no longer have a monopoly over distribution. For instance, when those Columbia narcos want to send [inaudible] to the u s they partner with Mexican drug dealers when they want to send it to Europe. They work with Italian, Greek and Albanian mafias, but we're going to talk about all of that in another video and not today.

Speaker 4:          11:16          The important thing is, despite drug trafficking still being an issue today, metagene is now a peaceful city. Of course, there are still bad neighborhoods where it's better not to walk through, especially on the outskirts of the city, but the city has made a big change change for the better.

Speaker 2:          11:31          This pax mafioso has allowed all the players involved with the cocaine business to make an agreement so that each of them has their territories and they have no reason to kill each other. Yes, cocaine is now easier to find than ever. There's less people die during the process.

Speaker 1:          11:45          Awesome.

Speaker 2:          11:51          Now, you might be wondering, well, what can happen that FARC have made a peace agreements with the Colombian government? Well, this could become an opportunity for the background to take back control of the business that is now in the qubit as Hams, but the truth is these Nike's, they're also trying to get a peace agreement with the government that is just as profitable as the one that fucking and negotiating crazy as it sounds for claims to be a political group with their ideology and propaganda even available on their website, which can be visited by anyone.

Speaker 1:          12:19          This is

Speaker 4:          12:19          why they sit on equal terms with the government. However, backroom are seen as normal criminals with no politics or ideology whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          12:28          Ads, of course, well days norcos they're thinking, hey, why can fox or with the governments and why can't we? The agreements between the FARC and the government, they're extremely good for the gorillas and once again, everyone, they want a piece of it.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Hey,

Speaker 2:          12:46          well that's a whole other story as well and now it's your turn.
