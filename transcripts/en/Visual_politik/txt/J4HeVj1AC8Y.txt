Speaker 1:          00:00          It's an image that will go down in history for the first time since plating ends and in 1953 and North Korean leader in this case, the ruthless dictator can Jong Uhmm Pacet ports in South Korea to declare his supposed intentions for peace and denuclearization. Now the questions are, is this really a moments of peace? What can we expect? Why does everything seem to suddenly be going so smoothly? I mean, is North Korea really willing to give up that nuclear bomb? Well, it's a view of these are some of the questions that I'm sure you are all thinking. Well, that's what we look at it. Shall We?

Speaker 2:          00:34          Okay, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39          Humming while walking and even holding hands toasting and dining together. This is how we were able to witness the north and South Korean leaders last Friday on April the 27th 2018 we're talking about the latest into Korea. Summit's in which both countries committed to seeking a definitive peace agreements. Technically, both careers are still at Wachter rebuild their relations and pursue the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. There's something took place in the demilitarized zone in the town of Pam and John in the exact place where the Korean War armistice was signed.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Both the North Korean leader, Kim Jong and South Korean president moon giant displays a level of complicity that would have been very hard to imagine only a few months ago pictures from that day. They are going to go down in history, and I'm really not exaggerating here. The scenes that we saw of walks, handshakes and whispers between the two leaders, what ends have been out of place in a romance movie.

Speaker 3:          01:46          Do you remember the honeymoon? I promise you we're going to have it.

Speaker 1:          02:06          And you know what, in a way that was precisely what was happening. It was a political courtship between two leaders who really couldn't be more different. On the one hand you have the South Korean president, Moon Jan, a lawyer who specialized in human rights, a man of humble origins, whose parents managed to flee from North Korea and she was an activist for democracy during his youth.

Speaker 2:          02:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:30          And on the other hands we have Kim John and one of the worst tyrants on the planet's. He's the omnipresent leader of one of the most terrible countries that anyone could possibly imagine

Speaker 2:          02:40          because

Speaker 1:          02:40          my friends, despite the summit's images in which Kim Jong Un almost looked like a cab app, let's not forget who we really is. Let's not forget that the North Korean leader heads a regime of terror in which human rights violations are part of the state's routine function.

Speaker 2:          02:56          Cool. Almost

Speaker 1:          02:56          forgotten the allegations that he had his half brother with a chemical weapon

Speaker 4:          03:00          just last year and then he had his uncle ripped apart with anti aircraft guns. Gary Samore, Obama's White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction.

Speaker 1:          03:09          In spite of that, and thanks to the images we saw as the declaration, both governments agreed on most of the press described this meeting as a historic day, the day when, once and for all peace tribe. All right, so now the question really has to be, well, how true is all of this? Are things really going that well? In other words, are we facing east sincere exercise in diplomacy or simply a big marketing scam? Has Pyongyang roadmap actually changed?

Speaker 4:          03:43          Dialogue is certainly better than a march to war. That said, we all need to keep our expectations in check. When Dr. Sherman, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs from 2011 to 2015 and in North Korea policy coordinator in the Clinton administration,

Speaker 1:          03:58          we'll explore this, but first here's a question that I'm sure many of us have asked. How the hell did we go in just a few months from hearing the drums of war?

Speaker 5:          04:07          Have you got time

Speaker 1:          04:21          assumption? Well cordio and harmonious meeting.

Speaker 2:          04:30          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:34          well we can come up with three different explanations. That's still compliments. The North Korean regime is new behavior, which in a very short time it wins from it threatening the United States to suspending its nuclear and missile tests.

Speaker 4:          04:48          Korea threatened to turn us into see a flames. North Korea says it will suspend nuclear and missile tests.

Speaker 1:          04:55          So let's take a look at the possible reasons for this change. And let me tell you things are not as simple as they seem.

Speaker 2:          05:08          Okay?

Speaker 4:          05:08          Pyongyang. We have a problem.

Speaker 2:          05:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:12          The first possible explanation, according to several analysts from the United States and South Korea in two studies by Chinese researchers, the Pong, every nuclear tests sensor located in the heart of a 2,200 meter high mountains in known as mountains man's hap could have collapsed after the last atomic test in which the thermonuclear bomb of 250 kilos tons with designated by North Korea and this area on September the third 2017

Speaker 5:          05:35          yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:42          explosion was so strong that it calls the 6.3 magnitude earthquake. Well, the collapse, it seems to have been confirmed and it isn't clear whether the center is operational a lot based

Speaker 4:          05:52          on the severity of the initial blast, the post test tremors and the extent of observable surface disturbances, we have to assume that there must have been substantial damage to the existing tunnel network under mount man tap, Frank v, pay Bian and Jack Lew.

Speaker 1:          06:07          If it isn't operational or if it's too badly damaged, it could take some time for the regime to rebuild it enough to be able to hold new tests in a safe manner. This could have definitely been a factor that could have altered the deadlines, but it doesn't seem like this could have been the main cause for the change of discourse

Speaker 4:          06:28          economy's stupid.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Another hypothesis has to do with the effects of international sanctions on the North Korean economy. As you all know, North Korea is a very, very poor country. You see, for years, a large part of the international community has imposed sanctions on North Korea, but these have generally not effective. The country's main partners, China, Russia, and Vietnam. However, all of this began to change with the sanctions that the United Nations began imposing on North Korea in 2017 in response to its continued nuclear tests for the first time, these sanctions were greatly fulfilled by China and that was a very hard blow to North Korea. The vast majority of North Korean trade happens with China. If that's cut well, Pyongyang has a very serious

Speaker 2:          07:14          problem

Speaker 1:          07:17          multiplied when in September after the last them a nuclear test, the United Nations Security Council bands, all of North Korea's key exports including coal, iron and textiles.

Speaker 4:          07:27          This resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime. The price the North Korean leadership will pay for its continued nuclear and missile development will be the loss of one third of its exports and hard currency.

Speaker 1:          07:44          An old lady that was in December, the same body agreed to limit their refined oil imports do half a million barrels per year, a 90% reduction compared to the amount of refined oil North Korea had purchased over the previous year. And what was the result of all of this? Well, several factories had to close due to a lack of raw materials and the army due to a lack of gasoline had to resort to coal engines. And even oxcarts. And although it may surprise you, this situation doesn't only accentuate North Korea's weaknesses, but it also is a hard blow to Kim Jong Un's governments making economic development's a big priority as of course these sanctions are also affecting the level of life the elite sends the incipient middle class. Enjoy. Well, hold on a moment. So an emerging middle class in North Korea. Well yeah, you had it right. In fact, here's a question for you. Do you think they've, a capitalist market can be developing within present day North Korea? Well, stay tuned for an upcoming video that we have on that. Even though all of this is important and to certainly influenced the situation, it doesn't sound like something that could put the regime at risk, at least not for the moment. You

Speaker 4:          08:49          think the North Koreans would revolt where the regime would collapse because of sanctions. You don't know anything. The North Koreans user, people who survived the famine by eating wheat came mission. A North Korean defector who works for South Korea's Essential Bank of Korea.

Speaker 1:          09:04          So then why is Pyongyang changed its discourse so much? Barb has it really just actually changed. North Korea is a nuclear power that is simply a fax. If according to American intelligence, this country currently could have between 20 and 60 warheads ready for use stan. Otherwise Pyongyang has already achieved it's great goal. It has its insurance, it has the best deterrent that has ever been built. Now, it is true that in the last April 27th into Korea, some is North Korea promise to denuclearize the peninsula, but Paul's on a moment because that doesn't mean it's willing to give up its nuclear weapons first because North Korea has already promised many things that they did and do. For example, the negotiations and agreements of 1991 1990 40,000 2007 2012 north grand promises not exactly something new and so far they've always been rather flimsy. You see, in 1994 Kim Jong UN's father Kim Jong Il even went so far as to started dismantling the nuclear program, allowing international inspectors to visit the country to verify the process. This was all in exchange for some generous health in the United States. However, years later the world found out that it had been a scam. The program had continued to developing clandestinely. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:42          In 2000 South Korean President Kim Die Junge announced that a new day would come after returning from his visit with Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2007 South Korean President Romeo Horn stated during his visit to North Korea, Kim Jong Il has shown a will to restore people. And the second reason we can't assume North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons is that we may not be on the same page about what constitutes denuclearization allow me to explain for beyond Yang. This time has got a lot to do, not only with its nuclear weapons, but also with the u s military is capabilities in the peninsula and in the region. And in any case, the truth is that it seems very difficult for Kim Jong Un to be willing to part with his best life insurance.

Speaker 4:          11:25          We must remember, North Korea is still North Korea. Kim is still at the same person he was when he purged potential rivals, imprisoned thousands of his people and had his relatives killed. This was a hopeful moment, but extreme caution as well. Warranted Abraham Denmark, director of the Asian program at the Woodrow Wilson Center and former US assistant secretary of defense for East Asia.

Speaker 1:          11:47          In fact, this is something that intercepted North Korea. Communications have definitely shown everything seems to be part of some kind of roadmap. First, ensure the survival of the regime, something he has achieved with its nuclear arsenal and seconds negotiate with the international community to ends the sanctions to launch a reform program that can attract investment from China and South Korea.

Speaker 2:          12:07          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:12          that means although far from how things might seem at first to Pyongyang could simply be following our well outlines plan was the insecurity or some summit, a big marketing exercise. Then this in a way explains why South Koreans, it's so skeptical of the North's promises. I mean just check out this survey, but now well it's your turn.
