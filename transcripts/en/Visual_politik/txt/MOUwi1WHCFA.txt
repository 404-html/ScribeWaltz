Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          Qatar is the wealthiest country on the planet. They're citizens enjoy a higher GDP per capita than the Swiss, or indeed any of the nationals from any of the other oil rich monarchies. But today we are not going to talk about this. In fact, the most important factor of this country is not their wealth, nor their absolute monarchy or their ties with radical terrorist green. Any doubt what made this country famous can be summarized in just two words, and those words are Algebra zero. It is the most influential TV network in the Arab world as one of the most important news networks on the entire planet. But at the beginning of the 1990s the royal family that rules guitar with an Iron Fist, the Al Tawny House had a dream. They wanted to turn the nation into the hedge and monique leader in the region. But the question was, how could they achieve this goal? I mean, we're talking about a tiny country with a smaller population than the city of Chicago. Of course they couldn't rival Saudi Arabia in the military fields and sharia law made it impossible to be a financial powerhouse. Further, their geographical position was nothing special either. There was only one possible strategy and that was the idea of so called soft

Speaker 1:          01:26          Hawaii

Speaker 2:          01:29          and otherwise influenced diplomacy. Well proper Ganzer. Since then, Qatar has invested more than any other country in improving their image to outsiders by doing things like hosting the soccer World Cup in 2020 to a formula one race and even directly sponsoring soccer teams. Among all these projects, the most successful am's famous of them all has to be their TV network, Algebra Xera. They aren't the market leader in terms of audience in the entire Arab wells. In fact, their market share some policies all of their rivals put together, and this is all despite the fact that the channel is banned in most countries.

Speaker 2:          02:22          I'll just say rabbi has led to the overthrow of governments in several nations. They have amplified the effects of the Arab spring and they've even become the unofficial loudspeaker for some terrorist groups since the attacks of September the 11th Algers era has become in many ways the only source of information for understanding what is going on in some parts of the worlds. Even CNN buys their footage. In other words, they are a respected media institution, but then again you might wonder, well, isn't Al Jazeera just a state propaganda channel? I mean, to what extent should we really trust their information and it's importantly what's their, well, today we are going to answer all of these questions, but before we do that, let's take a look at some history. Importance of being unique. In 1995 the BBC clothes, that Arab channel, because the Saudi government wanted to interfere in their editorial process, 150 journalism's got fired. All of them are of journalists who were trained at one of the most prestigious media organizations in the world. These people have a deep knowledge of Muslim culture, but at the same time they couldn't meet the high standards of Western media. This is where the emir of Qatar at the time, the hammered I'll tawny comes in. Right,

Speaker 1:          03:41          okay.

Speaker 2:          03:42          Tommy had just come to power, had a clear vision for his country. He wanted it to become the leader of the Islamic world. In order to achieve that, those 150 unemployed journalists weren't given an opportunity. As soon as they lost their jobs. Qatar offered them brands, new ones. Now what was their mission? Well, that was to create a brand new news network and Arab speaking media route and led that would meet the quality of Western media bounce. Benny cost has governments gave them a $147 million loan and with that, this team of 150 journalists could by state of the art studios. I've correspondence in many countries and broadcast through a satellite.

Speaker 1:          04:25          Everything

Speaker 2:          04:27          little detail was taken care of, for example, to design their logo via media made a public contest. Finally, this one, the one that you see on the screen now was the winner and as you can see and reads Algers Aaron

Speaker 2:          04:43          [inaudible] in 1996 Al Jazeera. That means the island in Arabic started broadcasting to the Arab world in very little time at all. They surpass the rest of their rivals. I think about it. I need, back in the day, Arab TV was extremely boring in this part of the world. Freedom of expression doesn't really exist and is therefore tv news just offered official announcements. I'll zero. It was different. They had a new problem with criticizing various politicians and royal families. They showed corruption scandals, Sam's, they even interviewed political dissonance. All of this was done in a dynamic style that had never been seen on Arabic television before. Nevertheless, the real turning point for elders here, right, was nine 11 or some have been laws and use this TV networks or broadcast his claim to the terrorist attack. All of a sudden, the name Algebra Syrup was being said on TV. News arounds the wells butts and autonomy that a month after the terrorist attack, the American government declared war on Afghanistan. Back then, all the big media corporations like CNN or CNBC had correspondence in Tokyo, London, or Berlin. There's no one had thought Kabul would be that newsletter.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Great.

Speaker 2:          05:55          Don's well. Dessie did an office in the Afghan capital. Yup. That would be Algebra Jazeera. Since they were a channel targeted to the Muslim world, they had correspondence in all of the Muslim countries. Suddenly Algers era footage was appearing on televisions all around the world. This is why in 2004 the emir of Qatar realized that what he had it not only was a powerful tool to reach the Arab world, but indeed the world at large and this is how English elder Xero was born and it was ready to broadcast into the most competitive media market in the world for United States of America.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Thanks.

Speaker 2:          06:32          Then Al Jazeera has become the TV news. The book's about countries that never appear on American TV news wants to know about Africa. Well tuned down with was era. What about the Middle East? Again, go to Al Jazeera Central Asia. Yup. You're beginning to get the picture. Lots of do. Wait a minute because things are not quite as great as they seem to be. Don't forget to, we are talking about a TV now. It's work that is being paid for by government in order to influence other countries. Starting to sounds a bit like it might be propaganda. Well, let's dive a little bit deeper. Islam's on fault. [inaudible] as we said before, Algebra's era was the first Arab TV network that openly criticized the governments in other countries.

Speaker 3:          07:17          We started the revolution back in 2011 rather. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:21          I'm surprisingly, this was not always welcome, especially given that most of these other countries are dictatorships. So in 2011 an uprising in Tunisia started out and the dictator of this nation abandoned. There's all of these facts. Could have had little to no impact abroad. There's Al Jazeera handed deep coverage of this uprising so that it can be seen in other countries. Since it was a satellite station, this signal was arriving, decides all across north Africa and the Arabian peninsula.

Speaker 1:          07:49          See, that

Speaker 2:          07:54          is how the inhabitants in other countries and next to Tina, Ziad like Egypt saw their neighbor's protesting and thought, wait a minute, we've also got a dictator. Couldn't we do something just like that ends. Of course, nearly every person in oppositions, you've never like had a news show that they could now watch ads. Of course, this was not something that wins over and brilliantly. Windows dictator. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:17          I'll just,

Speaker 2:          08:18          or a shutdown in Egypt as Mubarak fights for control of Airway, right. Well, what exactly is the problem here? Well, censoring the satellite TV station is harder than it seems. Of course. You can forbid it if you want, but if someone wants to access the station and they have a satellite dish, then technically it's possible.

Speaker 3:          08:39          If you were having problems receiving any allergies, there are channels. This guide will take you through the process of tuning your satellite receiver,

Speaker 2:          08:47          sorry. In a matter of a month, all of these Arab citizens were seeing then neighboring countries overthrowing their dictators and this explains in part the Arab spring phenomenon. No, wait a minute again because not everything is perfect. Of course. Salvagers there it helps to finish off a lot of dictatorships, but the truth is the people they promoted on their network when not really any more democratic. We came down for years. The Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader was given his own television show on Al Jazeera, even dash the Islamic state was portrayed by Al Jazeera as Johnston opposition force to al Assad in Syria and even as a group of moderate rebels. The same happens with other Sunni radical terrorists like al Qaeda and now you might be wondering is Al Jazeera and network as it stands for radicalism and against the West? Well, the truth is they've also been accused of just the opposite. Just ask the mayor of Bahrain and as governor,

Speaker 1:          09:56          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          09:56          Information Nabeel, I'll hummer told journalists that Al Jazeera correspondence had been banned from Bahrain. I'll hummer claimed that the station was a medium for quote Zionist infiltration of the Gulf

Speaker 1:          10:07          free drinks.

Speaker 2:          10:12          Surprised well for many Alphas era is a Zionist western propaganda. While for others it's the TV station of the radicals in fact is the only common grounds for Al Jazeera when it comes to ideology is the interests of the ones who finance them. The royal house of Owl Tawny, who by the way don't support freedom of speech and that beaks cables claim algae zero changed coverage to suit Qatari foreign policy. Nevertheless, if this doesn't mean they cannot show the dark side of guitar in fact to display being paid for by the royal house. Eldora Xera is more independent than many other states sponsored news net

Speaker 1:          10:53          blacks

Speaker 2:          10:57          for instance. What you see on the screen here are extracts from a talk show about being near slave, like whacking conditions suffered by immigrants, see work in Qatar as construction workers. This show foreign trade unionists were invited and had the chance to open the criticize the Al Tiny family and their policies. In other words, Algebra, there is directors are smart enough to limit that propaganda and not lose their audience. Of course they have an ideology and a lot of interests to meet but they are all aware but in today's world you cannot silence the reality of what's happening because if you don't tell us, oh this is going to tell it for you. The end of the day. Al Jazeera is forbidden in almost all countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia. Nonetheless, they are still the most influential amels, most watched TV network. Everyone knows who pays for them, but at the same time that they are the only source for many of the topics. In fact, the Al Jazeera model has lots of copycats. In 2003 the Saudis founded their own channel ally Realia. Further of the American government has their own narrative speaking network called Aha Ron. What about Iranian TV? His farm TV as a Spanish speaking network paid for by the Iranian government in order to influence the Hispanic world. They also have an English speaking channel called press TV and 2005 Russia launched Russia today also known as [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:30          Wow.

Speaker 2:          12:31          Algebra here, rob keeps exploring new possibilities. Their latest creation is a plus j a facebook page where they share viral.

Speaker 1:          12:38          Yes.

Speaker 2:          12:47          As now all question, it goes to you and that would be, do you think you'd stop watching Al Jazeera because you think it's propaganda or when do you keep enjoying the show as well?
