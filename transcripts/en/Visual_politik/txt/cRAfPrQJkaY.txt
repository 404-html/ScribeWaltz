Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          the full rights and Germany are two things that sound pretty scary. You when you put them together. This is why even though Angela Merkel has won the elections with a high margin, it has been a bittersweet victory. The facts, the alternative for Germany, a Zena phobic, ultra conservative party has become the third largest political force is bad enough to make merkel rather uneasy. We don't need to beat around the bush. We wanted a better result. That is clear. Angela Merkel it revision policy, what we plan to do a video this week about Germany, but the current news, forster, stupid spoon, that video so we could have time to prepare this one explaining what's an alternative for journey or afd as it's known in Germany is all about and yes, I probably know what you're thinking right now. You're probably thinking, come on Simon and how could you not predict that the far right would be a big hit in Germany because well, at the end of the day, Zena phobic parties that pretty much in fashion all across Europe plus afd did great in previous local elections.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Nevertheless, most of the polls said that Germans love moderation above all else, and that's not just the electoral polls talking, but also sociological studies. For instance, while in France, only 50% of the population places themselves on the center of the spectrum. This number in Germany is as high as 76% for the Germans have many reasons to be happy. They almost didn't suffer at all during the economic crisis and now that our economy is doing better than ever, it's salaries are rising, there's almost full employment and companies export abroad as if there was no tomorrow. So the big question here becomes who votes for the far right wing in Germany and most important of all, what is the alternative for Germany wants? Are they really a radical party or is the media exaggerating? Well, today we're going to answer all of those questions, but as usual before we get started, let's have a look at the history.

Speaker 2:          01:58          A party on the divide. Yes, it is true today alternative for Germany. They are a populist political party with a big focus on rejecting immigrants and refugees specifically. They want to reject those who come from Islamic countries, but just by all of this, it's origins couldn't be more different than what it is today. Let's go back to the year 2013 now. Back then, all the European media talks about was the debt crisis that was happening in countries like Spain, Italy, and it's specially Greece now. In case you don't know the history here, let's have a quick summary. Before 2008 German banks invested a lot of money in lending to companies and governments in the south of Europe, and it's after the financial crisis of 2008 these countries couldn't give the money back. In fact, they needed even more cash so that they could afford their current spending. This included things like the salaries of civil servants, highways and hospitals, and as you can imagine, paying day to day spending with debt. It's a far from ideal situation.

Speaker 2:          02:59          So this is where Angela Merkel comes along and says, all right guys, I'm going to lend you the money. I will even let you give it back whenever you want, but you've got to make some reforms. See your economic systems. These reforms, they were known as austerity. Germany, alongside with other northern European countries, wanted to lend money to Italy, Spain, and Greece, while at the same time demanding some budget cuts so that these countries would no longer need to borrow as much money in the future and so that they can pay back their debts. Those conditions. They were seen as pretty draconian by most of those southern European countries. They were asking the question, well, whose Germany to tell us how we should spend our money? Meanwhile, some Germans, they were also pretty mad at their governments. I mean, they were thinking, who are you merkel to go around giving money to everyone? This is the European Union, not an NGO. Now, among those angry Germans, there were three famous economists, Alexander Garlands, Burn luck, and Conrad Adam. These were the founders of the party electorial alternative 2013 which would later become an alternative for Germany. Any of these first supporters were bankers and university professors from the western part of Germany, cities like Frankfurt, Cologne and bond, and do you remember this? Because it's going to become really important later on

Speaker 2:          04:17          now in the electoral roll manifesto, they suggested that Germany should leave the euro and go back to the German mark as well. Why was that? Well, this is because they believe that they could avoid bailouts to porter economies by doing so and even more importantly, they could protect their economy from a luckily devaluation of the euro. As we've said in previous videos, Germany success was partly due to their strong currency

Speaker 2:          04:43          pain and Greece. They were pushing the European central banks print more money so that they could pay their debts back and as you probably know, economists, they thought that was a pretty bad idea. The first stereotypical afd voters weren't like the stereotype of an extreme right wing hooligan. They were considered to be businessmen, economists, and university teachers. This is why the media started calling this party, that quote to Teachers Party and why they couldn't win a single MP during the federal elections of 2013 I mean, think about it, and monetary policy has not exactly a sexy topic for an electoral campaign. I mean pretty much only you're going to be watching this video care about that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Okay. Nonetheless,

Speaker 2:          05:26          the phase of alternative for Germany, it was to change in July of 2015 at that moment, the economist burn lot of course the chairman bar to the brand new leader, frauke petry, she had other plants. I'd like the previous Cedars Petrie came from the eastern part of the country and this means she brought eight hopefully different political culture for her monetary policy deficits and fiscal responsibility wasn't really, that's important. Instead, she knew there was a big Nisha voters who wanted an iron fist on things like immigration and national identity. Besides these kinds of suggestions would give her the support of other leaders like Nigel Farrage from Britain's Ukip Party, Marine Le Pen from the National Front in France, and of course our favorite politician than the visual politic mascot. Yes, my dear viewer. Of course we are talking about the one and only

Speaker 1:          06:14          you up

Speaker 2:          06:16          Germany's far right wing party meets Putin allies in, yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:19          Moscow.

Speaker 2:          06:23          I know, I know Vladimir Putin is an ever popular topic here at visual politic. That's what I mean. How can we resist talking about him? No. During this time, thousands of refugees from Syria, Iraq and Libya, they came to Germany, Angela Merkel, she welcomes them with arms wide open and well some Germans, they didn't really like this, so in the regional elections of 2016 I'll tell him this. If the Germany launched an electoral platform, which had nothing to do with what the founders had in mind at the beginning, this is why many of those economists, they jumped ship among them. Luck. It was the first presidents,

Speaker 1:          07:01          pardon,

Speaker 2:          07:02          has fallen irretrievably into the wrong hands band. Luca since then, alternative for Germany has had two factions fighting each other. On the one hand, we have the people leftover from the first group, but they are less and less important to everyday ends. On the other hand, we have those who came under the leadership of Frauke petry. This new political structure. It does mean more voters, but it also means more problems.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Sorry.

Speaker 2:          07:26          The ftes, current crisis was triggered in mid January through a tableau breaking speech by right when you're bjorn hookah who in a beer hall and dressed in call for 180 degree turn in Germany's culture of remembering and atoning for the Nazi era regardless of how far right when you want it to be. These kinds of things then not really cool in Germany and this created many problems from this is patrick. There are some investigations open because apparently some of the proposals on her program might be illegal. Remember that German law is made to avoid any resurgence of Nazis. The issues in this party are big enough that even Fralca pitcher you herself had to resign one day after this last election due to in fighting with some of the more extreme factions of things

Speaker 1:          08:08          party.

Speaker 2:          08:10          Nevertheless, with or without the unfortunate quote, Sam's, the internal division, Alzheimer's. If for Germany, it has become the big surprise from this election. So the question now becomes, oh, voted for them. Well, let's take a look at this history of two. Germany's for the past few years, the German economy has been on fire, salaries are growing, companies are exporting and inequality is almost nonexistent. Well, actually just hold on for my own because that last bit, it's not exactly sure. Now of course there is almost no poverty on the streets and that our factories all over the country, but when we look at the income distribution by regions, do you see a clear division? If you pay attention to this map, you'll see a part, the red part,

Speaker 2:          09:04          it's a bleed. Pause is the wealthiest. The red part is the poorest. The blue part is what used to be western Germany and the red part is what used to be eastern Germany, communist Germany or that eastern part of the country is the Germany, the wing capitalist in 1989 but still doesn't have the same standard of living as the west. If you visit a city like Dresden in eastern Germany, you will see lots of construction going on. Most of the buildings they were completed just a couple of years ago, this is indicative that the reunification of Germany, it's still very much an ongoing process. Now, of course, if we compare these standards of living of an eastern German with a Greek or a Spaniard, it doesn't look that bad, but it's Germans. They like to be compared with other Germans, and when you do that, things look, wait, wes,

Speaker 3:          09:46          she made, doesn't have enough industrial opportunity and it lacks proper educational facilities. A large sport and cultural center aren't enough to keep people from leaving the city. It's dead quiet in the town center. Young people have left in droves for bigger cities in the west. A sculpture on the riverbank mirrors the city's troubled hopes for the future.

Speaker 2:          10:07          In this city, the city of sweat alternative for Germany got over 20% of the votes and Julissa further south in the state of Saxony. Most people are voting for the far right, but hold on a minute because we're not just talking about the economy here. We're talking about a totally different culture. Think about it. East Germans lived for entire generations under a totally different political system. This means a different education, a different lifestyle and different values here. Moderation. It's not really a good thing. In fact, of the left wing party day, Linka gets most of its votes in eastern Berlin, but there's more than that. Well, western German spent decades remembering their Nazi past. The government of the Democratic Republic of Germany tried to create a new sense of national pride. So when an afd candidate says that, we must appreciate the courage of the German soldiers during World War Two Germans from Cologne or frightened, but Germans from Leipzig say, well, okay, whatever. All right, but now there is a really important question. Why is eastern Germany is so much against refugees and immigrants? Well, many of you might think this is because they are tired of Muslims who don't want to integrate into their culture. Right? Well, here comes a number that is going to absolutely blow your minds. There aren't 9 million immigrants living in Germany and less than 500,000 in East German.

Speaker 2:          11:29          And when you're ready, think about it. This makes total sense. I mean those, he moved to Germany, they want to be in the wealthiest regions. So if you walked down the streets of Dresden, you're hardly ever going to see a woman covering her head with a hijab. And then guess who is the biggest immigrant community in eastern Germany? While surprise, surprise, that would be the Russians. Well then half of the immigrants living on this side of the country, it come from the lands of Putin and of course they are the biggest audience for German, Russia, Allan's well, this explains things like this.

Speaker 2:          11:58          FD Deploys Double Headed Eagle to snare Russian German voters. So now the question becomes, do you think alternative for Germany can keep growing in the next election or we'll it's internal divisions end up destroying the party.
