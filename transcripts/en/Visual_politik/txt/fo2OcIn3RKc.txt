Speaker 1:          00:08          In June of 2014, a single barrel of oil cost $114. Today the price is just $50. This drop is far beyond the usual fluctuations of price of this raw material and it's beyond the predictions of pessimistic defenders of the peak oil theory, the theory that we are about to have a severe shortage because petroleum is always running out more when the truth is that there are many different factors that suggest that the price of petroleum is going to remain low for quite some time. This is mainly due to two reasons. The first is the constant improvements of energy efficiency, meaning that we have a lesser need for energy. This is logical when you think that the group of OACD countries, that's the world's wealthiest countries are using the same amounts of primary energy as they used in the year 2000, but they are producing 30 percent more.

Speaker 1:          01:00          For us is the biggest market with 40,000 plugin cars purchased there in the first six months of this year. The second reason is innovation and technological development, a field of expertise that is inherent to human evolution. This is a development that has occurred on two fronts, both fossil fuels as well as renewable energies. The best example of this might be fracking. This is a technology that has provided the wells with a large amount of oil as well as natural gas. In fact, this technology alone has led to the u s doubling its oil production and it's currently that country is producing more oil than it has since the 19 seventies. Now, on the other hand, the ecological impacts of fracking is a highly controversial topic that that's something we're going to address in a later video. Now, the reduced price of oil has been an incredible sense back for Persian Gulf countries where 85 percent of their revenue relies on this until now. This has allowed for the payments of all kinds of bills. Citizens of got use to high levels of subsidies and allowances while also getting used to not having to pay any taxes to subsidize everything. Water, electricity, fuel, low interest loans, and citizens have also got used to the idea that they have a right to a well paid civil service

Speaker 2:          02:14          job.

Speaker 1:          02:20          More countries in the Persian Gulf of gotten used to spending an enormous amounts of money on guns. In fact, they've spent so much money on weaponry that Saudi Arabia now spends more on its military than Russia. This makes it the country with the third largest military budget globally.

Speaker 2:          02:43          We all

Speaker 1:          02:43          know that oil money has paid for pro Islamic campaigns all around the world. However, these preexisting policies have become completely unsustainable due to the drop in the price of oil. In fact, in 2015 alone oil producing countries last $360,000,000,000 in oil revenues.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:04          and this is all because of the harder drop in the price of oil. Now I'm going get me wrong. They do still get an enormous amounts of money from oil. Saudi Arabia, for example, against around $5,500 per capita from it's black gold mounted display link, this still significant amounts of income. They are able to maintain all of the subsidies that they have established because of this changing scenario, all countries in the Persian Gulf are announcing ambitious plans to diversify their economies. This will allow them to get some distance from the economy's completely relying on oil they aren't looking to follow do by his example, which has been one of the only countries do successfully transitioned away from a totally oil based economy in the last 40 years.

Speaker 2:          03:53          Because of this

Speaker 1:          03:53          diversification away from the emirates is becoming a world leader in terms of poor ism trade and the stick.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Tens of billions of dollars are being invested into Qatar with the hope that it will become an economy of knowledge. They proudly show off their education city development, a huge educational complex where some of the most prestigious schools in the wells can be found. There are also notable researchers working there with budgets that seem almost infinite. However, the most archetypical case is the one we find in Saudi Arabia, one of the world's most suffocating and terrifying countries. Human Rights in Saudi Arabia are nothing more than an illusion. Women are forced to marry under rage and they can't even drive further. Dozens of executions occur every year, and torture is quite routine lasts for me. Homosexual acts, trees, treason and murder, a punishable by death through beheading and Saudi Arabia and the Islamic state. Further, the country has even banned theaters and nightclubs in Saudi Arabia. Religion and fundamentalism are more important than anything else.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Last economic crisis cannot be escaped and today they are facing a very complex situation. In 2015, the deficit was at 15 percent of the GDP and this continued into 2016. This is threatening to swallow up all of the money that they saved during the black gold of years. Further, unemployment is becoming a major concern and this is no more true than among young people. The unemployment rate is currently sitting for young people at around 40 percent. This is why in April 2016, Prince Mohammed, Bill Sahlman, the strongest man in the kingdom, announced an ambitious reform plan known as Saudi Vision Twenty, 30. The goal of this reform plan is nothing less than do transform the country's economy.

Speaker 3:          05:49          They say, look, this is a good plan. We need to diversify our way because of necessity. Otherwise the country will have far more difficulties in the years to come.

Speaker 1:          06:00          The plan aims to achieve total independence from oil by 20 slash 20 and become one of the most globally competitive economy is by 20, 30. The first step of this stance by privatizing Aramco. This is one of the world's largest companies which controls 10 percent of global oil production. The company's estimated value is five times that of apple with all the money from them. Privatization, addition of foreign reserves of the privatization of public companies, and it's real estate. Saudi Arabia wants to generate a sovereign wealth funds, have $2,000,000,000,000 tell them to get a more predictable and stable income than they are currently getting from oil. They will see once you eliminate many of the subsidies that are currently threatening their economy and to invest in new sectors like mining, finance, and importantly the military industry.

Speaker 4:          06:53          Uber is getting a three and a half a billion dollar investment from Saudi Arabia's public investment fund.

Speaker 1:          06:59          New taxes are also going to be introduced as another method of earning for the governance. The prince still wants to change the higher educational system, which is currently closer to the Koran and develop. It's to meet modern market requirements, but the big question has to be, is Saudi Arabia going to succeed? It is no easy task for a country to quickly become an industrial power and it is unlikely that tourists are going to be drawn to a country which sees people regularly, stones for homosexuality or adultery. However, all of that said, Saudi Arabia success will benefit the wells no matter how repulsive we personally find that policies. Seventy percent of the Saudi population is under 30 years old and over the next 10 years they're going to require 2 million jobs. We all know that when frustration unemployment's ends, religious fundamentalism add up. The consequences can be truly dangerous to the Bonnie has proved that moderation and capitalism can lead to changes in fundamentalist regimes.

Speaker 1:          07:57          We can only hope that Saudi Arabia can successfully follow the example that has been set by Dubai, but that is our opinion here at visual politic. We want to know what you think. Do you think Saudi Arabia will succeed? Do you think it will successfully follow the example that has been set by Dubai? Do you think that capitalism can encourage moderation in countries like Saudi Arabia? Do you let us know your opinion in the comments below?
