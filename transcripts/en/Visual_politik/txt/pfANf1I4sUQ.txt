Speaker 1:          00:07          Uruguay's the country famous for soccer. As we celebrate Russia's, we'll see this summer we've checked the whole fame and there are only eight countries that have ever want to final year grier, really small country with a little more than 3 million inhabitants while there one of them, they've even won the cup twice and in both cases they beat their need as Brazil and Argentina.

Speaker 2:          00:26          Tina.

Speaker 1:          00:30          So in today's video we're going to talk about how Uruguayan has beaten then neighbors, but not in soccer, but rather in economics. Yes, alongside Chile. Uruguay is the wealthiest country in America when it comes to GDP per capita, but it's also one of the most stable when it comes to politics and that has some of the best public services, but there's even more to this story. We can actually say that Uruguay is the model for the entire South American left wing. Have you ever heard about their former presidents seem weaker? He's known as the world's poorest presidents and he quickly became the ultimate leftwing or rockstar. He's the only world leader. We refuse to live in the presidential palace and kept driving an old Volkswagen instead of an expensive official car.

Speaker 1:          01:13          From a life philosophy perspective, I believe it's better to live little luggage, just the minimum necessary, no material complexity. If you have too much complexity, you end up spending too much time. Nevertheless, while knew who kind of has this simple lifestyle, his country grew economically, it's attracted foreign companies and it became a pioneer with social rights with me here as President Uruguay passed a bill for the legalization of same sex marriage. That's undoubtedly his most famous policy was the legalization of recreational marijuana sales way before California or any other country. Uruguayan was the first country to legalize the sale and consumption of wheat and the country's progress. It doesn't stop them. If you take a static picture of Uruguay, you will see a country. There's arguably is the best place to live in all of South America.

Speaker 1:          02:03          If you take a static picture of Uruguay, you will see your country. There's arguably is the best place to live in all of South America. Unlike Brazil and Argentina, Uruguay is economy hasn't stopped growing since 2000 and to have a thriving middle class since the highest wages in the region along with Chile, but hold on a minute because not everything is a field of roses. ROSACEA. In fact, as such a prosperous country, you might expect it to have plenty of immigrant. Right? Well, the reality is actually ready difference, and this is not because they have strong immigration laws, people just don't pick a Uruguayan as a country of residence because well, things are actually starting to go rather sour. They have around an 80 percent unemployment rates and that economic growth speed is reducing. Well. Other countries like Peru and Chile seemed to offer opportunities for everyone. So today's question is why has Uruguayans economy worked out so well until now? Ones. What are the current problems they're facing? Well, today we're going to answer all of those questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history America. Switzerland. Uruguayan was born in 1830 after a war between Brazil and Argentina, the British words and negotiate the peace agreements, and they badly wanted Uruguay required to be an independent country.

Speaker 2:          03:18          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Why was this? Well, Montevideo is harbor was a jewel and they didn't want it ending up in Brazilian or Argentinian enhance back then Uruguay. It was almost uninhabited. It was inhabited by a tribe called the Cero [inaudible], but they were soon exterminated. This is why unlike many other South American countries and most of Uruguayans have a European ethnicity, mainly Spanish and Italian roots in those times, if you are an ambitious boy looking for a career and an opportunity to make money, Uruguay was the place to go. It was better than America and it was better than Australia. It was a modern democracy with rule of law and a thriving. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:52          Economy

Speaker 1:          03:56          until the sixties of the 20th century. This country was among the wealthiest in the world. It was way richer than many European nations. In fact. So now you might be wondering, well, what exactly happens? Because despite being prosperous among South American nations, Uruguay is still way behind any European country, let alone America. So what happens to make them stop growing so dramatically? Well, the answer lies in the whole things. The European Union. Yep. You heard me right? Devita. If you thought this idea of a trade war was donald trump's invention on the very mistaken in the year 1958, the European single market was created and one of the first things they did was to protect their agriculture from

Speaker 2:          04:37          neat

Speaker 1:          04:40          meant that rule quite lost their biggest customer. The United States didn't want to trade with them either. It was in the middle of the Cold War and they were too busy dealing with bigger problems than this little country to pay attention. So Day by day Uruguayan became stagnant and it's the government's in Montevideo, the country's capital. They didn't have any other alternative than to look to their neighbors. Argentina, all of a sudden, Uruguay and Argentina became something like the Robert Rodriguez and Quintin Tarantino of South America. Argentina had a financial crisis, so did Uruguay. If Argentina had a military dictatorship, well suited Uruguay, Argentina had a democracy. Well, yes, so data Uruguay. So Dev you are well what happens in Argentina in the year 2002? Well, they have the biggest financial crisis in all of history. The now in famous Carlita ends in the very same year. Uruguayans GDP fell by seven point seven percent, which was a big time catastrophe.

Speaker 1:          05:41          And this was when I realized they had to find new trade partners, but how would they do that? Well, let's look into it. Zero kilometer of South America during the 19 eighties, Uruguayan returns to democracy and the government did something really, really interesting. They created the so called Zonis frankness. These were special territory's inside of the country where companies were free to not pay taxes, no VAT, no income tax, no corporate tax. The only request was that 75 percent of the jobs that are given to locals. Maybe this reminds you of something because it's pretty much the same idea as the special economic zones that exist in China that we liked so much here at visual Polish,

Speaker 2:          06:21          sick

Speaker 3:          06:23          or acquire has 11 tax freeze,

Speaker 2:          06:30          the three d

Speaker 3:          06:32          different kinds. First we have those oriented to logistics and international trade. After that we have the zones that are designed for attracting multinational corporations that can use them as the headquarters for the South American. Finally, we have the areas that are meant to have high tech industry and this is why or requires a regional leader and things such as pharmaceutical research and software,

Speaker 1:          06:56          but this is not the end of the story. These tax free zones have a unique advantage. Something that makes Uruguay a model for other countries. Yes, if you are here, we're talking about political stability. In the year 2005 Uruguayan changed its government leadership and they had lost a left wing presidents that would be to bad Vasquez from the open friends party. You see in most South American countries, having such an ideological shift in the government means that most of the work made by the previous administrations, something goes into the trash.

Speaker 4:          07:32          Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:32          so you might think that under a brand new left wing government, those tax resigns would no longer exist. Rice. Well, the reality, it actually couldn't be more different. And this is the great thing about this country, the bipartisan consensus. This is why between 2005 and 2014, the accumulated investment in these tax free zones rose to almost $6,000,000,000 and all of this happens while first Vasquez and then Jose Mojica managed the country. She will keep them here for not looking only for profit. They also want safety and this is what roadway has to offer. It's not a matter of this or the other government. He is a genuine attitudinal neck. The emily one's a well, what does Uruguayan get from these tax free zones? Well, that is a double benefits of them. Actually. On the one hand, they are able to appeal to industries that otherwise would have set up in other countries with bigger markets and these foreign companies need providers. This is why sooner than expected, many small enterprises are created around the country and of course they require highly skilled labor and that means good salaries. This is why Uruguayans do need to emigrate in order to find a good one

Speaker 4:          08:46          job. The

Speaker 1:          08:51          of the moments here, because we said that Uruguayan needs to change trade partners, right? Maybe you remember how we said that they could no longer depends on Argentina or Brazil for their exports, so you might not be wondering, well, what did the tax free zones have to do with all of this? Well, just think about it. Thanks to these innovative industries that set up in the country. Uruguayan could stop relying on the commodity of sex prior to this. Their economy was based mainly on it and don't meet today. They create products that have more value added.

Speaker 1:          09:25          Giving you an example. All of the Syrup and he did in Pepsi drinks sold across all of South America is created in Uruguay. In fact, there's a particular type of Pepsi in Japan called Pepsi Zukie. This is made with a plant called sweet theme, and again, the Sarah for this beverage is produced a 200 kilometers away from Montevideo in total. Pepsi represents seven percent of everything. The country exports, and this is not the only example, one of the biggest papermaking companies on the planet, a Finnish company called UPM has one of them main factories in Uruguay and they've already announced the construction of a brand new facility that might represent a whole two point five percent extra GDP for the country, and if that isn't enough, Uruguay is also a software leader

Speaker 1:          10:12          or acquiring software developers among the best in all of Latin America. In summary, 30 percent of Uruguay's exports are produced from these tax free zones, and yes, here's the main buyer here. Well, let me give you a clue. It starts with a C and h and I, and it ends in an A. Nowadays Brazil and Argentina received just 20 percent of this country's exports. I don't think a friend of your required is the Netherlands. The Rotterdam harder is the gateway to Europe as many of the Uruguayan exports go that way to make a comparison. Chili's economy, despite being the wealthiest in the region, is heavily reliant on that copper mining, half of their exports of this commodity alone Uruguay. Instead, it's got a diversified economy. We've talked about software, paper drinks, and of course cy and nice, but if you thought of everything is all sunshine and rainbows and hold on a second, it's because things are not quite as perfect as you might think. Party versus government, as we said before, since the year 2005 Uruguay has had a left wing governments, more specifically, this country has been managed by the Open Front Party and one thing is certainly true. They are worthy of that name because it is really an open policy with plenty of different ideologies inside. This is why despite what it looks like, arguments a pretty common thing in the potty.

Speaker 1:          11:37          So on the one hand, despite the different presidents, why hasn't the same finance minister for the last 30 years? His name is denny Louis' story and you could say that he's one of the architects of this Uruguayans too,

Speaker 4:          11:51          but on the other is the open front

Speaker 1:          11:54          is really a battle fronts between the radical wing as the moderate wing champions by two that Vasquez hosting me because the left wing Rockstar, he's somewhere in the middle and this is why anytime Uruguayan government wants to sign a free trade deal with any other country, they must face that own party opposition. It happens during the first Vasquez administration when they tried to sign a deal with the United States. It happens when they tried to sign a deal with Chili and it might not happen as they want to sign a deal with China.

Speaker 3:          12:22          In Atlanta, Emilia, 2018, we will mark the 30 years of diplomatic relations with China and this is why we have put this date as a deadline to sign a free trade deal.

Speaker 1:          12:34          In this case, Uruguayan companies would save more than $100,000,000 in needless tariffs, but this radical wing of the open front seems to be allergic to the word free trade, and if this was not enough, some critics claim that Daniella a story the finance minister spends to missile.

Speaker 4:          12:52          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          12:53          this is actually one of the biggest problems in IRC required after Venezuela and Argentina, Uruguay has the largest share of civil servants in the region. One out of five workers is employed by the government, and if you add to this the enormous presence of an illegal economy, you'll understand why just one third of adults work for private companies in most developed nations, this number is more than half.

Speaker 1:          13:22          Of course, compared with Argentina or Brazil. Uruguay is a paradise on earth, but the truth is if they wanted to keep growing, they must solve these problems as soon as possible.

Speaker 4:          13:35          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          13:36          Now the final question is, do you think Uruguay should sign those free trade deals? Do you think it is still worth investing in as a country?
