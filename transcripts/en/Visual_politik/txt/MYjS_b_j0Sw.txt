Speaker 1:          00:00          Why is Donald Trump's so interested in punishing the Islamic Republic of Iran? If you've seen the previous two videos in this series, you might believe that he's interested in raising all prices, helping us Saudi friends. I'll just showing the European Union who's boss. But here's another hypothesis. What if Donald Trump is actually going after the end of authoritarian rule in Iran? This is not a stupid theory. Iran is that the edge of economic collapse and to government protests, uh, frequented. Unlike other countries in the regions in Iran, Dunn's have a secular, liberal and democratic. Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:48          This means

Speaker 1:          00:50          you don't need to wage real war to bring democracy to this country choking regime financially,

Speaker 2:          00:55          you know,

Speaker 1:          01:01          it actually works. Donald trump could even be looking at a Nobel peace prize. Not only that, it would make Obama look dumb and trump would win the 20, 20 election for sure, but what if it doesn't turn out as well as he plans? What if the ayatollah's regime is not as weak as he thinks? Can Trump win the bat? Well, there's video. It covers all of that. Iran is the man. America loves to hate, of course, the White House claims that the nuclear sanctions are not meant to topple the regime, but is that really true?

Speaker 1:          01:43          House national security advisor, John Bowlby says, the United States is not seeking to topple Iran's government, but since Washington does want authorities in Tehran to change their behavior, but truth is for decades, America has been trying to do everything possible to curb the Iot has power. For example, have you ever heard of Radio Free Europe? During the Cold War, the American Congress created this radio station to spread anticommunist messages into the Soviet Union. Today this radio is still exists. Indeed they have their offices very close to where I am recording this video in Prague, in the Czech Republic, and guess what? This radio has a whole department just defaulted to Iran. They broadcast and using the Farsi language to spread anti ayatollah messages in signing the contract.

Speaker 2:          02:32          Does

Speaker 1:          02:32          this mean this means that Washington is most definitely interested in a regime change in Tehran, but once you get really badly is one thing, whether it's actually possible is quite another. So the question that might be in your mind right now is, is Iran really that bad of a dictatorship? I mean, at the end of the day, they've got elections, they've got political parties, right? Well, yes and no. Yeah, it is true, but Iranians can vote for the president, but the actual person in charge is the supreme leader. Ayatollah Khomeini for better understanding how many shoes is most of the ministers and has the ultimate word on international affairs and many of the important, oh, and of course it goes without saying. The political dissidence I'll absolutely prosecuted and often killed by the government. In fact, despite having some opposition movements, there are almost no important leaders. Why? Well, that's because they're all dead in prison or exiled. Know what happens with the pro system, but physical forces, well rather than political parties, we should

Speaker 3:          03:38          talk about the different factions. One Hand. We have the so called hardliners, hardliners, support the system created by Khomeini to the letter religious law and state led economy. We have the reformers want to change the regime from the inside. As you can imagine, this faction is losing power nowadays.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Finally,

Speaker 3:          04:09          we have the pragmatist, who's most important representative would be the current president, Hassan Rouhani, pragmatist lie, somewhere in between the hardliners and the reformers. They want some economic reforms, better relations with the West, but also want to retain religious control over the political system.

Speaker 1:          04:26          And here we have the second question. Is it really possible for this whole political system to fall apart? Well, there is a chance you see when an economy is doing well, it's easy to keep an authoritarian system. Getting. Many citizens are pretty much happy to say, yeah, I'll trade a bit of freedom if I get some welfare, but Iran has spent too much time without welfare. Iranian currency. There y'all is devaluing every single day and this has led to a brutal inflation. Some non official estimates claim that Iran will have more than a hundred percent inflation rate this year. That means that some prices change on a daily basis. Many foods like chicken are starting to become scarce and there are more and more people living below the poverty. Even with the government privatizations. The economy is a mess. We're already told you, you right here on visual politic at the beginning of the year, 2018 started with massive protests against the Rouhani, governments, and many of those protesters were young university students. He wanted a shift in the system, uh, shifted to a system that's democratic, secular, and liberal. But the question that, the real question here is, is all of this enough to cause regime change? Well, today we're going to answer that question, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history

Speaker 1:          05:46          taurine guard. In the end. Nineteen 79, the Islamic revolution started in Iran. The supreme leader back then was the Ayatollah Khomeini, and he knew that the army might be transit anymore decades of saving the shower pleasure. It was hard for them to change their loyalties overnight. This is why in order to avoid acute ta come and he created his own parallel army. This is how the Islamic Revolutionary Guard was created. It's a sort of modern day Praetorian God designed to preserve the Islamic republican system. In the beginning, all of the members were volunteers, but things changed in the eight.

Speaker 2:          06:24          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Back then, Iran started a war with Iraq and who did they send to the front? Of course, they sent these Praetorian, see why willing to do anything for their cause and do you know what, in times of warfare, there's always money for weapons. This is how the Islamic revolution regard gained a lot more influence and certainly anymore weaponry and experience. By the end of the Iran, Iraq war, this Praetorian God already had more than 130,000 soldiers, plus many other smaller cause that dependence

Speaker 2:          06:56          them

Speaker 1:          07:04          today. This revolution regard hasn't signed intelligence service parallel to the government's Ministry of Intelligence and they can imprison people and investigate them without us even reporting to the authorities. In other words, they are the cornerstone of the Islamic revolution, but then again, they do have this parallel system and well, why are they important? Well, the truth is, as far as the economy goes, it's hard to create an alternative to the system. If you have an elite corp spying on any would be political activists and yeah, we really are talking about an elite core here. They're perfectly trained for hybrid warfare. They fought in many other wars such as in Syria, Iraq, and even in Afghanistan, and all of the experts say that training as well as class.

Speaker 1:          07:56          You might be wondering. I mean, we talked about weapons. How do they buy weapons if Iran is so isolated from the international market? How on earth is that possible? Well, the truth is that for decades, Ron has had its own weapons manufacturing industry. Yep. You had that right. They use Chinese and Russian designs, but the manufacturing is all done in Iran. So now of course the question becomes will they be affected by these economic sanctions? I mean, at the end of the day, if Iran has no money, there's got to be able to buy bullets and weapons. Right? Well, if you are, the reality is nothing

Speaker 1:          08:35          external pressure and black. A foreign competitors will most likely help the Irg see further consolidate it's grip over Iran's economy. Ali Elforni, Arab Gulf states institute in Washington for better understanding, a big portion of Iran's economy is in the revolution regards hands. They own many statement or police cleaning oil companies, refineries and real estate firms. For example, 51 percent of Iran telecom belongs to them. Add to this, the fact they pay almost no taxes and do you have completely self sustainable economics with a parallel army that so well maintained? It's hard to have regime change well bus, if you've thought this was the only asset that the ayatollah does have, well you'd be wrong, and now you're going to see why

Speaker 1:          09:21          China comes to the rescue. We've said this many times in this three video series, China will keep buying oil from Iran. They just can't stop doing this. China needs a lot of oil and for years Iran has been there six most important supplier. We're talking about more than 800,000 barrels that come from Iran every single day. With these numbers. It's really hard to change providers and. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Probably right now. You've probably seen those previous videos and you're thinking, well, America has got that secret weapon that's going to keep countries from buying Iranian oil. As we talked about in the last video, basically no tanker can dock in a harbor if it's not covered by an insurance company in most of the insurance companies. Well the European or American. So now the question comes is how does China buy oil from Iran with this problem? Well, check this out.

Speaker 1:          10:15          Elusive. China's shifts to Iranian tankers to keep oil flowing a mid US sanctions. Yeah, you have that right. Without insurance companies, Iran will take care of the transport and bad all of the risk and this. Well, this is pretty great for the people receiving the oil before that have to worry about maintenance, but now they're on bays. They'd have to worry about a ship now reaching its destination. Don't worry. Iran spaying ships things in the. See something terrible happens again, Iran pays, but this is still not the whole story. Think about it. If the rest of the world is going to stop investing in Iran, what do we have left? Exactly. We've just freed up space for China's money. Hence news like this

Speaker 2:          10:58          Chinese

Speaker 1:          10:59          from to invest $2,000,000,000 an oil refinery in Iran. Yeah. Yeah. You heard that right? China is taking advantage of the void. Other companies have all act. In fact, they are even buying the investments. Other European companies have nate, for example, of this type, all the French oil company in 2016, they started building what was meant to be the biggest gas field on the planet. Now with trump sanctions, chances are they're going to have to retard this projects. Guests who's ready to buy it. Well, that would be China

Speaker 2:          11:31          this summer

Speaker 1:          11:32          in 2018, the trend of development bank announced that they will provide more than $15, billion dollars in loans for all kinds of things.

Speaker 2:          11:41          Gotcha. Might

Speaker 1:          11:42          wonder in the grand scheme of things, is this a lot of money or not so much? Well, it has already helped to start building five brand new hospitals. And then what about other companies? Really when I told you that Iran is one of the biggest car manufacturers in the region. Well, one of the main brands there is cyber. They've already signed a joint venture with another Chinese company called Brilliance, but this, this is just the beginning. Was the most ambitious projects currently going on from China? Well, yeah. That's the one belt. One road projects. That's the new Silk Road that shooting pain wants to build. I's Iran as important belt and road pub. So far they've already started to renovate several railroads. The idea is to connect the main Iranian cities with high speed train so that they can transport goods and now you might be wondering, well, why is it so important? Well, just have a look at this map and Milan.

Speaker 1:          12:42          Imagine a train full of mobile phones traveling from China going through Central Asia and then going from Iran to Turkey. It looks like the perfect group for trying to just sell mobile phones. Dr. Right now, of course, this is just one idea. So far, Chinese businesses are already facing many issues in central Asia, but this is definitely a massive friend of the video. The truth is China is starting to invest heavily in Iran. Does this mean that Xi Jinping will save arounds economy? Of course. Nice, but will this be enough for the regime to survive? Well, just maybe, and this explains why in recent years the political relations between these two countries are becoming more and more fluid.

Speaker 1:          13:25          Ping Holtz talks with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. So now is your time. Do you really think that trump's sanctions will help end the ayatollah's regime?
