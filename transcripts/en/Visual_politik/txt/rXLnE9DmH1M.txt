Speaker 1:          00:08          Japan a country that brags about two things. The first is the used underwear vending machines, which yes, you really can find on the streets, and the second is the immigration rates, which is by far the lowest in the developed world for comparison in the United States. The immigrant population is about 14 percent. Canada and New Zealand's have 20 and 25 percent respectively. And then this Japan with an immigration population of less than two percent. What's the reason for this? Well, quite simply it's they're very restrictive immigration system. This makes Japan something of a dream country for politicians like Donald Trump or marine le pen. If there is one word that could define the current political debate, that word would be immigration. In Europe, countries are arguing about what to do with refugees and it seems the politicians across the board seemed to think that immigration is a problem that needs to be stopped.

Speaker 2:          01:08          Immigration has fallen under this government and we've cut net migration by a third.

Speaker 3:          01:12          Anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Since I took office, we've deployed more border agents and technology to our southern border than ever before,

Speaker 1:          01:31          so then Japan is a perfect example of what our country would look like without really many immigrants at all, and so now you might be wondering what exactly does that mean for Japan's economy? Do they really save money because they don't have to spend on social policies for immigrants further deep Japanese work as enjoy a higher standard of life because they don't have to compete for jobs with foreign workers. Hands on this episode of visual politics

Speaker 2:          01:55          going to be answering those questions. Before we get into all of that, we need to have a close look at Japan's immigration law.

Speaker 4:          02:03          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:05          country one culture, one race. This statement was said by the man who was the prime minister of Japan in the mid 19 eighties. Viceman was Yasuhiro Naca. The Statesman's clearly summarizes the immigration policy of Japan. Basically there are two ways to get into the land of the rising sun. One is where they work contracts and the other is with a tourist visa. If a company wants to hire you from overseas, you will need a work visa and the only possible way that you can get that visa is do you have a university degree or have some specific skills that are practically impossible to find in the Japanese labor markets, so if you are just to construction worker, you are never going to get a work permit for Japan. That is, unless you use this other program

Speaker 2:          02:47          on Japan, didn't have a lot to accept workers from other Asian countries like Vietnam or Philippines. They graded the so called technical internal training program.

Speaker 1:          03:01          This in summary is sort of like being an intern in Japan, except you get about half the salary. There's a Japanese in turn would get not only that, but with this technical internal training program, your boss has even allowed to hold onto your passport and access your bank accounts. More worryingly than that. Since they started this program, thousands of Asian immigrants have simply disappeared. For

Speaker 2:          03:25          when the Union Representative I spoke with me, she said that my attitude was bad and that if I continue to have this heavy dude, if my actions continued her friend, we'll hire a hitman to kill channel.

Speaker 1:          03:39          So well, what if you ended up with a tourist visa? Well, in that case you can stand the country for a year and a half as long as you can prove that you are studying Japanese. Once that initial time has passed, you need to get hired by a company. This could lead to you getting a work visa, but do watch out here because unlike in the United States or certain European countries, this work visa stipulates what your profession is. So for example, if you get that work visa saying that you are a chef, then you could only work in a restaurant. If you break this rule and do some sort of other work, then the government will not renew your visa. There is only one really effective way for a foreign. So you make a living in Japan,

Speaker 2:          04:16          the most part thing to get the was like the easiest thing to live here is marrying a Japanese person.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Now I heard you can understand why in a country with over 127 million inhabitants, I need 2 million of them are immigrants, but what consequences does this have on the daily lives of Japanese citizens?

Speaker 2:          04:40          He's a Japanese pensions.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Japan is the oldest country in the world, not because of that long history, but because of the actual physical age of their population. In fact estimation save. It's in the next 90 years, they're going to lose about 44 million people from their population, which is about the entire population of Canada and now this wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for these social security system. As you probably know the pen. As you know, the pension system in most countries in the world works in the following way. The people who are working today are the ones who are paying the pensions of the people who are retired today. As the workforce gets smaller and smaller night, year after year, the number of people paying those pensions is getting smaller. Further on the other side of things, more and more people are retiring who are drawing more ends, more social security, and this leads to problems like this.

Speaker 4:          05:30          Yes,

Speaker 2:          05:33          social security contributions cover only 60 percent of these benefits, the remaining 40 trillion jen comes from taxes or more precisely public deficits

Speaker 1:          05:48          way. The music you're hearing in this video is from the Spanish band Mescalina if you like it and want to check out more of their stuff and do you look in the description box?

Speaker 1:          06:04          Why pay attention to this mosque? Japan has the highest public debt of any country in the world. Their current debt level is more than double the GDP and to their fiscal deficits. The difference between the income and this spending is higher than the one in the United States. In other words, if Angela Merkel where to go to Japan, she had probably get very, very angry. So like now you might be wondering, well, what does all of this have to do with integration? Well, the answer is a lot. You see, we've all heard about how expensive it is to integrate immigrants. You have to pay for social programs, integration courses, etc. Etc. But no onE really talks about how much are you native citizens costs.

Speaker 4:          06:45          Yup.

Speaker 1:          06:47          For an example, an american Born citizen costs the government $150,000 by the time age 16, and this is only for education and health care depending on the state that that person lives in. You minds have to add in other expenses, but the government sees all of this as an investment because when that person stops paying taxes, they're going to get that money back. On the other hand, let's take an example of a vietnamese immigrants to Japan. He comes to the country when he is old enough to start whacking his education and healthcare was already paid for by the vehicle average of two years. That'd be in the knees. Immigrants is going to find a job. Now, of course, that might be a low page one and you might pay just a little tax, but the japanese government didn't have to invest any money in, so in other words, immigrant, so free cash, but the government, since Japan has so few immigrants, they are losing out on this easy influx of cash. this is why in the middle of a fiscal crisis in 2015, the japanese prime minister shinzo are. They made the following amount under pressure to accept more immigrants as workforce shrinks. But despite what it looks like, this is not japan's biggest problem. Japan has seen the last 20 years go by with no economic growth. This is what experts have goals the last decades and it has a lot to do with immigration as well.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Create that. It stopped innovating. We all want to enter in Japan as a country of technology and innovation. The country where companies like nintendo, sony, toshiba, where they will

Speaker 4:          08:28          on line.

Speaker 1:          08:31          So the reality is these companies are really old. Nintendo was founded in 18, 89, and so I always said it was created in 1937. Actually. Can anybody name any japanese companies that were created in the 21st century? You probably couldn't, but on the other hand, you could probably name five to 10 american companies that were formed during the same. It started at 52 percent of all new silicon valley companies between 1995 and 2005. The entrepreneurial rates among immigrant populations is two to three times higher than natives, and this is a trend that you find in every country. For instance, one of the founders of google, sanjay brinn was born in moscow. The cofounder of whatsapp was born in. Yeah, just about silicon valley startups. Just take a walk around your neighborhood and you'll see hundreds of chinese doors, mexican restaurants, and all other kinds of small businesses created by immigrants and it does make complete sense that immigrants will have an entrepreneurial spirit. At the end of the day, though, you seem leave their home country on risk takers. Not only that, immigrants bring with them their culture to a new country, which helps them. In thinking outside of the.

Speaker 4:          09:53          Let's take a look.

Speaker 1:          09:54          There's another example. Charles feldman was a german immigrants. Do New York city in the 19th century. Soon he realized that the work is in the city, needed some sort of food that can be cooked and sold on the streets, but that's when he decided to import sausages from his home country and that's when the hot dog was born. TodaY this meal feeds millions of people from all around the planets and this. This is just one example. There are thousands upon thousands more in short, when cultures mixed new ideas and methodologies are created. This is what business people call innovation and this. This is the special sauce that makes companies and countries

Speaker 1:          10:36          well, what's going on in Japan? I'm surprisingly, Japan has the lowest entrepreneurial rate in the developed world. Just seven percent oF the population decides to start a business by comparison and countries like Canada and New Zealand. That percentage is about 10 percent. The japanese dream isn't to start your own business. It's to get hot by one that already exists. You know those big companies that we previously mentioned, like sony and sheba, companies that have the same corporate and work structure that they had in the 19 eighties traditional japanese electronic power houses such as sharp and sony having kurt huge losses and shed thousands of jobs, well competitors, apple and sAmsung have continued to increase their market shares, lazy like football or what american schools soccer like keep up with the world cup or the us championships. Twenty years ago there were at least two japanese companies sponsoring these events in 2016. The european cup had no japanese sponsors and no matter where you look, japanese companies are struggling to compete with the european american indian, chinese companies, and the reason is not a lack of money. It's a lack of innovation. And this explains why japan's economy has been so frozen over the last few days.

Speaker 1:          11:55          This is having a major impact on the millions of Japan citizens in order to keep productivity up. Japanese workers have the longest working hours and the shortest holidays of any developed nation. Meanwhile, they still have the same salaries that the pattern. So that is our opinion here, a visual politic, and now we would love to know yours. Do you think Japan should open its doors to immigrants or do you think other countries should follow japan's example and close their doors to immigrants? Use the comment section below to let us know.
