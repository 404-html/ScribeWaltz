Speaker 1:          00:08          Showing you that is already a giant. This country is the largest trading power in the world,

Speaker 1:          00:16          the wells with hundreds of products and have one of the largest foreign currency reserves in the entire planet. I don't see even the petro monarchies in the Persian Gulf can compete with this giant country. Ends with all of this. It isn't surprising defined. Some analysts see states that China will surpass. The United States is the leading economic power and they're going to do that. We have a lot more inhabitants. However, we usually forget a very important thing and this is the GDP. Well, it's not everything. Economic power. The real power is closely related to corporate power and when it comes to that, China is still a long way from reaching the levels of the United States. If we look at the top 100 largest companies in the world, 56 of them are Americans and only 11 are Chinese, and this is something to really bear in mind because multinationals in controlled of foreign investments ends of 80 percent of the world's exports. Now the big question is, what's going to happen to these Chinese companies in the future? How are things changing and what can we really expect? These are some of the questions that we're going to be answering in today's video.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Chinese giant development, the Chinese economy, as had unimpressive growth rates in the last three decades and key to this was the concept of them being the welds factory. This is what China is known for. They are known as a country that has become a world power and has lifted hundreds of thousands of people from poverty with a relatively simple premise, producing everything and producing it at a low cost. Toys, electronics, tools, clothing. When you enter a store, you aren't going to find hundreds of products with something in common and that's that. They are all manufactured in massive industrial areas located all over China.

Speaker 1:          02:02          The in order for a country to really be the leading economic power, these companies need to start producing much more complex products. Mans they will have to stop competing on cost and start looking at far higher added value. This can include the production of things like capital assets, planes, medical devices, and computer processes. That driverless car, I have seen it all entails driving the future traffic, light street lamps, business runs on the cloud, and the cloud runs on Intel and today all these sectors are dominated by the large multinational companies of the United States, South Korea, Europe, and Japan. It is true that many leading products are manufactured in China, for example, the iphone, but this is not exactly true because what China actually is more like the assembly. What this means is that the more complex parts they're bought from other countries and then they simply put together in China to better illustrate this, consider this.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Each year trying to import more than $200,000,000,000 in semiconductors, which are essential in the manufacturing of mobile devices.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Just for comparison. That is more money than what the entire country spends on petrol. However, Chinese companies have made many advances

Speaker 2:          03:26          today. A fourth of all exports are capital goods such as machines for example, or high tech products.

Speaker 1:          03:34          In some sectors like telecommunications, wind turbines or high speed trains. Chinese companies, all the world leaders, just that because Chinese companies are also learning how to make it in the international market.

Speaker 3:          03:49          Yes,

Speaker 2:          03:53          great. Chinese conquest.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Two Thousand and 16 was the 40th anniversary of the ends of the cultural revolution. This was a telephone campaign which now organized in order to purify the revolution and finish off all remnants of capitalism in Chinese society. Since then, things have changed a lot so much that China is only behind the United States in terms of numbers of multinational companies, companies in this country that's starting to make it into global markets as well. They're doing it really, really well.

Speaker 2:          04:26          20 16 Chinese companies spent an incredible amount of money, $225, billion dollars in the purchase of foreign companies in Europe and the United States alone. They acquired more than 450 company.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Chinese companies are buying all kinds of businesses, mining companies, banks, oil companies, pharmaceutical companies, agricultural companies, even luxury hotel chains, jewelry companies, and football clubs. Yep. Yeah. That right to view of the Chinese have even bought into Milan and that is just one example.

Speaker 2:          05:01          Just your city gets a $400, million dollar Chinese investment deal,

Speaker 1:          05:05          but if there is one thing in particular that the Chinese love to invest in, well that would be developing country

Speaker 2:          05:14          Australia and the United States are the two countries that receive the most in Chinese investment dollars. More than half of all Chinese investment is made in emerging countries located in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Almost save at the more risky the country, the more willing the Chinese art to invest in it. Know this might surprise you, but this, this is not the end of the story. Chinese companies are also starting to compete hard. Well, if there was only one Chinese company and the top 100 most valuable companies in 2006, that was 14 by the year, 2015. And take a look at the smart phone industry.

Speaker 3:          05:52          Yeah, up

Speaker 1:          05:56          until having a Chinese

Speaker 3:          05:58          phone. Well, it was a bit weird, right? Well today the four main Chinese manufacturer is Apo. Huawei, Vivo in Chalmette ons, just more famous than they were a few years ago because they also take more than 10 percent of the welds profits in this industry and this is a figure that is growing more and more every single year and if you want another example, whether you just have to look to Lenovo, which is a Chinese multinational company that was born just a few years ago and indeed it bought the laptop division of IBM and is now the largest computer company in the world as they even supply equipment to the Pentagon and how about even more examples this hire the biggest manufacturer of household appliances or go a company that's acquiring land all over the world like sugarcane plantations in Australia, French vineyards or soy plantations in Brazil and then this Guidea Cola company which you might not have heard of, but it actually bought out Volvo in 2010 Volvo. That legendary Swedish car company is now property of a Chinese company.

Speaker 1:          07:00          That is a sector where China is really getting ahead. It is against all the odds, the Internet, and I say against all odds here because as you probably know, China is subject to complete control of its Internet by the Chinese government with something known as the great firewall. This blocks access to you facebook, Google ends the economist to name just three. However, on the other hand, in China, it's pretty normal to do everything via apps. For example, when you visit China, you rarely pay with credit cards. The most common thing is to pay with a mobile phone using the APP we chat. This is something of a super app that is like an all in one facebook page, twitter, etc.

Speaker 2:          07:39          By the way, we chat is also owned by ten cent, one of the top 15 most valuable companies in the world, which is also the world's largest supplier of online games and one of the largest shareholders of tests

Speaker 1:          07:54          by now. You proBably realizing that, oh yes, the chinese, they are everywhere. as for another example of their success, do consider ali baba or an ecommerce company that brings in $450,000,000,000 every year and in China relaying this company, it has $400, million clients and dwelled, as napoleon said, let's try and asleep for when she wakes up, she will shake the wells, but before we all getting at sketch, just have a think about what it means. It means more competition. It means better prices, better products, and faster technological developments. As consumers, we can benefit a great deal from this transition. Now obviously it does have plenty of risks to, or at least this is what us intelligence agencies all warning,

Speaker 2:          08:40          according to the house, permanent select committee on intelligence is report. Chinese companies cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus posted security threat to the United States and to our system,

Speaker 1:          08:53          and then there's the risk are companies which are going to have more and more competition all day. They're also going to have more and more opportunities to which we previously discussed in the video. That will link to you on the screen now, but let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Chinese companies all still far behind in technological terms as they are in debt and well a great deal of it.

Speaker 2:          09:15          Chinese corporate debt levels are too high, but it will take time to bring them down to more manageable level.

Speaker 1:          09:22          This, this is not the end of this. Don't forget that China is a dictatorship and this means that the government tends to much power when it comes to corporate decisions. Further, the government's is pretty arbitrary and it's really unpredictable. For example, a few years ago, the government encouraged chinese companies do try the international markets and they would loan them as much money as they needed to do so. Now they've decided they want to do the opposite. If a chinese company that wants to buy out a foreign company, the need the approval of the chinese communist party and there are new tough limitations on money leaving the country further to that, we have to mention the censorship, the legal uncertainty, trade obstacles and the bad reputation of chinese products and so on and so forth. So we can say that right now, the United States, his position as leader is not in particular danger unless something changes that is more dramatic than we are currently seeing. Long term though.
