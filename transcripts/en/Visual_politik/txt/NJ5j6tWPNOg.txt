Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          it's hard to put a sign. Two thoughts when thinking about Africa. The first is the thing that Africa is a continent forever sentence do poverty, illness, starvation and tragedy and the loss of tragedy. So the Africa is often thought of as a somewhat compact territory web. Everything is connected to westernize. Africa can look more like a country than a consonance with many feedings or realize the colossal size on this continent. Africa is as big as Europe, the US, India, China and Argentina combined. So now you can imagine the deluge felicity, that this huge territory must contain in 2010 if the economist referred to Africa as the consonants without hope buses as can often happen, things rapidly changed in Africa since the start of the 21st century. Africa that has experienced a significant boost, especially in the poorest countries on the continent with the exception of South Africa. The countries of sub Saharan Africa achieved annual growth rates of 6.2% while comparison that is twice the growth rates of countries in Latin America during the same time period in 2015 five of the 10 economies that grew the most in the world. Where in Africa, these are the Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The growth rate of these countries exceeded 7%

Speaker 3:          01:27          Democratic Republic of Congo is been ranked among the top 10 countries for reforms in the world. For example, in 2014 there are already nearly 7,000 enterprises that have been created.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Although the growth figures were a bit smaller, the situation remains similar in the year 2016 all of this growth has led to some really significant social consequences. So let's have a look at some of these. Foreign life expectancy has increased significantly over the last eight years and child mortality figures and those dying from starvation has been cut in half. To sum up extreme poverty, you still affect 58% of the population in 1990 900 now it is decreased to just 35% it is still true that more than 420 million people are still suffering from extreme poverty in Africa, which is tragic. There's fortunately the future is looking brighter than ever. Right? Another thing is also certain Africa is going to have a major global role over the coming decades and it's middleclass or consumer class is the fastest growing in the world. The fact is Africa is no longer an emerging. It is here now. Africa is being urbanized quickly which allows for both the provision of public services and also economies of scale. In the near future. We are going to find as many of the world's biggest cities are on this call.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Smith

Speaker 2:          02:47          who knows Lagos, Nairobi or accurate money to become the new Shanghai in just a few short decades. For example, the tallest skyscraper in Africa for Haas Tower is currently being built in Nairobi in Acra, the capitalist of Ghana. Six malls have been built in only six years and while that might not seem like a lot when you consider that there was only one mall in the entire city before those six new ones were built, it seems like a little bit more foreign investments has also grown strongly in the last few years and it's half of these investments operating areas they'd have nothing to do with Africa's natural resources. This is important because many of the countries in Africa are trying to develop industries outside of raw materials, so they are depending less on these natural resources. These economies are known as the African lions, the African lions. These African lions include Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia.

Speaker 2:          03:41          These other countries in Africa that are developing the fastest. Now we're going to discuss each of them in detail in upcoming videos, but today we're just going to focus on three of them. Russel Rwanda, this is a small country with a population of only 12 million people and it doesn't have any coastline. It is still a poor country but it is registered and almost 9% annual growth since the year 2001 and importantly this country has no oil or other important natural resources. So the big question is, well how did they do it? This has actually been mostly down. So you supporting business creation. This is why Rwanda is the second easiest country to do business in in sub Saharan Africa according to the world's bank doing business report. So the question you might be asking is this is a coincidence and we have visual politic, we really don't think so.

Speaker 2:          04:27          We are know what example looking at under the 50th their 50th if we got word organized, if we other way with it and you put everything that's needed and to the world are connected. The portable growth. Now thanks to all of this, nearly all children have primary education and as a 98% of its people already have access to health care. As a consequence, child mortality has been reduced by 60% had to aids and malaria have also seen significant reductions. Further Rwanda, President Paul Kagame, he claims to be a disciple of Lee Kuan Yew, the legendary leader of Singapore. Here we're going to be discussing in an upcoming episode, so don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already, so you will get notified of our bats. And also Wayne miss out on any of our other videos, if you up yet

Speaker 2:          05:11          is a much larger country with a population of nearly 100 million people in Ethiopia. Around 20 million people still have nutritional problems and that is not the only problem they have. The government's also become more authoritarian recently. However, things aren't changing fast. And today, Ethiopia's Capitol Adis Abba is always pursuing significant construction projects. In fact, about a year ago at us, out of the bar opens the first modern tram system in all of sub Saharan Africa. And to be honest, they deserve it. Ethiopia is a country which has grown significantly in the last 10 years. It's economy as multiplied by a factor of five in this period and it's GDP has grown by over 10% every year.

Speaker 4:          05:48          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:54          Now you might be asking, well, how did they do it? Well, they were simply trying to be more attractive to investors and then neighboring countries. In doing so, the country has established at two main priorities. One achieved stable macro economics and to establish attractive taxation, for example, and in boards of technological equipment such as machinery, does not have any important charge that other companies don't have to pay any tax in their first five years, which is pretty cool. Nice.

Speaker 2:          06:24          We couldn't do this video without mentioning Botswana, the country which recently celebrated in 2016 at the 50th anniversary of its independence. What's one APP has been the greatest economic success story in all of Africa? In fact, it is even one of the most successful worldwide at the time of Botswana's independence in the year 1966 it was one of the poorest countries on the planet on top of that, and so the country has suffered severe droughts and does suffered from the second largest aids epidemic in the world. In spite of all these obstacles, the country, it has experienced developments, so significance, but it's GDP in purchasing power parity is equivalent to two countries such as Columbia, Brazil, or Thailand's. This is obviously considering the different levels of prices among these countries.

Speaker 5:          07:06          Si.

Speaker 2:          07:11          Yeah, the key to success and can be found in the strength of its national institutions that healthy public finances and above all the country's legal certainty. In fact, in the last CPI corruption perception index, Botswana was ranked in 31st position. This is a better position than countries like Spain, Israel, or Taiwan, rule of law,

Speaker 6:          07:31          regulatory reform, good governance, all those things matter even more because people should be able to start a business and ship their goods without having to pay a bribe or hire somebody whose cousin.

Speaker 2:          07:42          But now, how about some more surprising facts about Africa? You should know that this continent is already home. It's a 400 companies with a turnover of more than a billion dollars a year. So it really does seem that the ends of Africa being a totally poor consonant is coming to an end. Furthermore in Africa we can also find Nollywood is the second largest film industry in terms of films produced in the world. Only 2,500 films less than Bollywood. Further in Nigeria alone, the film industry employees around a million workers. Now for just one final surprise, Africa is the wells leader in online banking and mobile phone payments. Yes, you probably weren't expecting that, but it is absolutely true today many farmers share information through SMS and in the string silvery ones it is popular to use safe motos, which is like a Rwandan version of Uber, except there's a small difference.

Speaker 2:          08:36          Instead of using cars, they use motorcycles because there are very few cars available. So the thing about Africa is that it is changing incredibly fast, but the truth is that there are still many challenges and difficulties that the continent is going to face. A hat, for example, consolidating the rule of law, reducing poverty and improving their infrastructure. And of course they supports in ends once and for all to all those terrible dictatorships in countries like Angola, Eritrea or Equatorial Guinea. However, everything does seem to indicate that the future of Africa is brighter than it has ever been. So I hope you found that video interesting, and we would love to know what you think.
