Speaker 1:          00:08          Let's don't today's video with a question. Which country would you say is the US? His biggest ally is a Canada. Maybe it's the UK as well. What about Israel? Now, this is not an easy question. Zones are, and it definitely depends on who you asked. Whether that is a country which has improved. It's aligns with the U. s a great deal over the last few years. It has improved enough that it is for Republicans, the best friend of the country, its biggest ally more so than any other country. I know it's not Canada and the UK or Israel. It is Australia. The country of Surf Kangaroos and the Sydney Opera House.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Surprised. Well you shouldn't be. Australia is Devi. You are the only country in the world to have fought with the US in all of them. Big Wars, World War One, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Afghanistan, Iraq, and now we'll see the operations against isis for the bends. Again, we could almost say that Australia is to the USA. What these score is to Imovie and at first might go unnoticed, but remove that music and you can see that it's really something that's going to be missed on January the 28th, 2017, and despite this old alliance, Donald Trump decided to hang up the phone on Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, not just that though before we told him to get lost and hung up on him at trump, accused him of trying to export terrorists, do the United States, and this was all just about a slight disagreement that these two countries had over 1000, 250 refugees, but that's the story that we're going to get into another day. Yes, this brief diplomatic tussle might not seem like that much in the grand scheme of things, but it has had a lot of consequences. Many Australians are left wondering if it isn't time to start cooling off the relationship with the United States. Spike just listen.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Well naturally. This is something we started wondering as well. It raises questions like how important is Australia for the United States and was it really sensible for trump to hang up the phone on his greatest ally and all kinds of consequences? Is this going to have for him? Well, let's take a look. Shall we time for Asia, probably not news to you, especially if you've been following this channel for a while else has changed ends. Both the political and economic power centers are moving quickly to Asia, like 20, 20. It is expected that more than half of the world's economy and population will be located in this continence and China is emerging as a new superpower as well. That's a fact. I've been told now a map of the world has looked pretty close to

Speaker 2:          02:43          why

Speaker 1:          02:47          from now on, we're going to see things looking closer and closer to this.

Speaker 2:          02:51          Yes, as you

Speaker 1:          02:53          can see, Europe is leaving the center of the Weld Indians taking up a position in the corner. All right, so that's a fun comparison, but we come really denied that the world's changing. What the hell is that? It's where you've been living this whole time, the 20th century. It's going to be Asia's century something. We've discussed a bunch of visual politic that is my former US president, Barack Obama decided to bet strongly on Asia and make this continent is top priority for American diplomacy. It was under these circumstances that Australia became such a valuable friends, but how close is this friendship between the US and Australia? Well, let's have a place to look.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Big Alliance,

Speaker 1:          03:38          November of 2011, Barack Obama and Australia's prime minister at the time, Julio Guillaune signing military agreements, which meant a new era for military cooperation between these two countries. We could always say that this new treaty started a military friendship between the US and Australia. In fact, let's take a look at the description. The New York Times wrote about this agreement agreement with Australia and mounts the first longterm expansion of the American military presence in the Pacific since the end of the Vietnam War bus. Well, what did this agreements, what did it really mean? Well, for starters, thanks to the treaty, the US can deploy a floating force of up to 2,500 soldiers in Australia. These treats are from the Marine Corps and they are able to quickly deploy it in the event of any conflict, but don't think that this is the end of things. Since the collaboration between these two countries has grown and grown, it has grown enough to become an essential relationship for Washington. It's not just the marines. The United States wants to make Australia the key home base for their activities in both the Pacific and Indian Ocean. Now you're probably getting the idea the US wants to have access to landing strips situated in the north of the country. From here. They want to be able to deploy B, two and B, 52 bombers. They also sent out a large naval base near path for their enormous fleet of nuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear sub

Speaker 2:          04:59          marines

Speaker 1:          05:06          and there's more. The United States is also trying to locate and monitoring centers and missile launch warning facilities that to even once he rents parts of the Coco islands in the Indian Ocean, which an Australian sovereignty. So you might now be thinking, what do you need? Why would the United States wants to rent some random remote islands in the Indian Ocean? Well, the answer is actually pretty clear. The US wants to locate to their long range surveillance aircrafts and armed drones on the Coco Islands. They also wanted to use this archipelago as another deployment center for that bombers in case of war, but wait, because there is still more, the United States wants to improve the integration between their army and the Australian military so that the two forces could work together whenever need it. Now, if you don't exactly understand what the results of this could be, well, do consider this in the last few years, Australia has carried out a significant renovation of them military equipment. We're talking about purchase contracts worth billions and billions of dollars and among these there is quite a lot of American material. Take the controversial f 35 as an example, Australia has committed to buying 72 units, which is going to cost $19,000,000,000. This is a serious amount of cash and it's. We're talking about the country with a little more than 24 million inhabitants. It's like per person. It's really a lot of money.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Alright, so now you've got to be wondering why Australia, right? Well that's for several reasons. First because both countries are culturally similar and as we've said before, they fought together and many times, seconds it's because Australia's geographical position is almost perfect. It's situated between the Indian and the Pacific oceans and it is close enough to the hot spots in Asia that the US could carry out attacks and deploy troops there quickly and last but not least, there's another important factor. Australia is an important energy, raw material and food suppliers or Trynna, so it depends again, believes that in the event of a conflict or tough tensions between the two countries, it would be convenient to have control over Australia. I'd say, well, what about the other side? What do the Australians once they basically understand that the US can sort of be an insurance policy, no way to ensure their own safety. Some voices who disagree, these voices, they seem to be growing louder and further. Trump hasn't helped with his whole hanging up the phone

Speaker 2:          07:30          thing.

Speaker 3:          07:33          That Chinese alternative

Speaker 2:          07:36          China.

Speaker 1:          07:37          It is by far the largest trade partner for Australia. It is the first destination for Australia's exports. It's the country of origin for many of the immigrants coming to Australia and besides that on more and more Chinese people who visit the country every year who have decided to study that anyway. The Chinese mean a lot of money for the Australian and well that has its consequences.

Speaker 3:          08:00          A 2016 survey conducted by the Public Policy Group Lowy Institute asked respondents to identify the country that was more important to Australia. Forty three percent chose the United States and 43 percent China in 2014, 48 percent had answered the United States and only 37 percent had chosen China, New York Times and look

Speaker 1:          08:18          under 45 year olds clearly have opted for China and almost half of the country's population believed their country should keep some distance from trump's America book eating and important Australian x prime minister, for example, is one of the personalities. He thinks it would be best at trying to improve relations with China and less relations with the United States, cooled down a bit and pay particular attention to how he explains his.

Speaker 3:          08:42          The Society of artists is a better society than the United States. It's more even. It's more fair. We've had a 50 percent increase in real incomes in the last 20 years. Media in America has had zero zero for now. Australia has made some

Speaker 1:          08:56          kinds of gestures towards the Asian giants. As an example of when spanaway Washington didn't like this at all, the country decided to participate in the Asian infrastructure. Investment Bank and institution led by China whose aim is to increase China's influence in the country. The Australian government itself has made it clear that China is above all a source for opportunities for the country. Luckily for trump though, there are still many things that protect his relationship with Australia, American culture and the fear of the Chinese.

Speaker 2:          09:30          Australia.

Speaker 1:          09:31          I'm the US all politically, culturally and economically similar countries. They are so similar. In fact, it's an international level that it could be argued that Australia is nothing more than an extension of the American lifestyle in Asia, and the truth is that a lot of Australians are pretty proud to be considered

Speaker 2:          09:47          that way.

Speaker 1:          09:49          Whatever happens, I will not tell my affection for the American people and the best of American culture that was not raised in America, but I was raised in the American century. I have not yet ready to say goodbye Lisa prior. Furthermore, the United States is still the largest investor in Australia and investment. If that exceeds $500,000,000,000.

Speaker 2:          10:07          Yes,

Speaker 1:          10:09          mostly the fact that China is still a dictatorship is making Australia suspicious. Many simply don't trust Beijing's intentions. In fact, the government has stopped and many Chinese investments operations that intended to buy land in Australia, so we can't say that it kind of all of indicates that the alliance with theu s will continue, but the Australians, while there are very practical people and they have made it clear that they don't want to be affected by a future hypothetical war of power between China and the United States. It's like, well, that's what we think here at visual politic, and now we'd love to know what you think. Do you think the United States will despise trump, uh, carry out the projects they had planned to do in Australia? Or do you think China will achieve more and more influence in the country?
