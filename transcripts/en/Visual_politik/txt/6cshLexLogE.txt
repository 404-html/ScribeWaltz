Speaker 1:          00:00          This is a special video today we're talking about a topic that heavily affects both this channel and in general all of Youtube as a platform, but don't worry, nobody is shutting down this channel, but maybe those of us who watched from the European Union will no longer be able to watch some videos yesterday were talking about article 13, something you might have heard of it, especially if you live in Europe because youtube seems to have replaced all of my youtube ads which were previously. Would you love a chocolate bar with something related to article 13? Now, let's quickly make one thing clear here. We definitely biased, but that's probably not a huge surprise to you. In fact, we're playing an active role in this matter. One member of the visual holistic team was in Brussels recently talking about article 13 with policymakers who are currently negotiating it. That by the way, it would be Fonseca also known as the drunk Spanish guy doing the voiceovers in some of the earlier episodes. According to some comments.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04          To this day, there is an association representing European online creators. This is why a group of European Youtube channels decided to take a bit of an initiative and show our concerns, do the relevant politicians, visual politic. We were one of them, so for those who don't know, it's article 13 is part of an EU directive which aims to regulate copyright online, but the question is now, well, what exactly is article 13? Is it as terrible as everyone is saying and most important of all, what can we content creators do about this? Well, today we're going to answer all of these questions, but before we do, as always, let's take a look back at the history for me for the last few years answering the what do you do for a living question? I kind of got sort of complicated. Some people, especially maybe the oldest, they tend to think, oh, well that's nice dear, but you know what you do for actual money. Some of them I've just given up on. I'm pretty sure that my grandma thinks I'm a television presenter here in Prague.

Speaker 2:          02:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:14          But the answer is yes, I make a living doing this and it's probably not all that surprising to all of you millennials watching. Now we British, we don't like talking about money. Indeed. Fun factor were seven times more likely to tell someone we've had an std that we all to reveal our income to the awkwardness. Let's just take visual politic. Both the English and the Spanish version combines. They get about 10 million views a month and as you can imagine, this translates in do something. You know, it's a lot of people watching now. No visual politic. It doesn't make us millionaires, but along with the Patriot on donations, thank you very much. And the ads, we can all draw a decent salary and look, we're not the only ones. There aren't thousands of creators just like us all across Europe, creators, enough of an audience to make an income and even create new jobs. And that's only youtube. It also happens on other platforms like instagram and facebook and twitch. This means that online creators, we've become an industry. I mean it's not exactly an oil and gas, but it does exist. It's an industry that employs thousands of people in Europe and creates value for society most of the time. Yes. Youtube might be an American company, but the world's biggest youtube. That's Pewdie Pie I think.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Hold on.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Yes, go Pewdie Pie. He is still beating t series and he's Swedish. Alright, so what exactly is the problem then? Well, like I said, there is no association that represents US creators,

Speaker 1:          03:49          media corporations in record labels and they've got trade associations and they've even got big lobbies in Brussels. We don't why? Well, mainly because we started out little by little. The story behind every youtuber is pretty much the same. You start small, make a few videos, hopefully you see a bit of growth and then suddenly you can be like, oh, I do this as a job. And as you can imagine during this process, as someone who's been through this process, I haven't. And I imagine most people don't think at any point now I should create a trade association, you know, just in case one day the European Union is like, let's introduce a big old directive that really affects these people. It's just something that doesn't come across on mine.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Alright, so at this point it's probably important for you to know exactly how copyright works in Europe. Well, to this day we're under these so called ecommerce directive and also the copyright directive. Both of these were passed back in 2001 so. Well, how does this legislation work? Well, let's imagine that I upload a video to visual politic and I use a video clip from a band. So let's say I upload a song by the band Tasmania who often provide music for this channel, but let's assume I upload their song without permission. This means I'm actually created something illegal Tasmania role. The record label who holds their rights can then sue me.

Speaker 1:          05:16          This means that essentially they can request a big fine from me. And do they do it well? Probably not. I'm a pretty small creator in my pockets. I'll just not that deep so well. What can Tasmania do? Well, they can go to youtube and they can ask them to take down the video. Indeed, this process is often mostly automatic. Youtube actually has a tool that small filter called content id. In this case, Tasmania would send all of the information about their on to youtube. This way youtube can scan the platform looking for that song. Anytime they find it, they can take down the offending video. This is how the law works. Well, that's all fine and that's all that good, but just

Speaker 2:          05:58          hold on a second because this is where the interesting part comes in. Now it says mania can pretty much ask youtube, hey youtube, how about instead of just taking that video down, your slice me off a bit, a sweet sweet revenue pie and send it my way. Now according to the letter of the law, Youtube doesn't have to block the song if requested, but the law doesn't say anything about paying licenses, which is essentially what Tasmania wants. Nonetheless, since youtube is apparently pretty chill, they want to do business with Tasmania, so they essentially say, all right, then what we'll do is we'll negotiate a license, we'll give you a little slice and everyone's happy. Sounds good, and otherwise they've negotiated a contract and now you might be wondering, well, how big is that slice of the revenue pie? Well, according to the record labels, it's pretty low. Just consider what economy.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Some user upload content platforms refused to compensate artists and all music creators fairly for their work. While they exploited it for their own profit. Sir Paul Mccartney, the question now is, is Paul Mccartney, right or wrong? Youtube states they give to the majority of the revenue to the record label, but we don't really know because the labels want to keep this information confidential. We also don't know because, well we asked them and nobody would tell us. There is one thing we do know though, the European music associations like IFP, why or impala, they want youtube to pay more. They claim there is a so called value gap between the Revenue Youtube generates and what they pay them. In other words, they want to have a stronger negotiation position and how can they do that? Well, that would be with a new copyright law that forces platforms like youtube to pay a license. This is why in the year 2016, the European Commission wrote the first draft for this

Speaker 2:          07:50          direct

Speaker 1:          07:51          Dev on copyright in the digital single market. According to this law, Youtube and the rest of the user generated content platforms, ms dot compensate fairly to create us. This means that youtube doesn't give that added percentage because they're chill, but rather because they're legally compelled to. And this is a big deal. This means that the record labels have a better negotiating position. Alright, so so far all of this, it doesn't actually sound that terrible. So just hold on a moment though because this is where things get really complicated. Devil is in the details as you might or might not know, the European Commission itself cannot pass the law. They have to send it first to the European Parliament and vendor, the European Council. These two institutions, they have to write their own versions of the Lauren. This is where the real issue with article 13 comes up.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Online content sharing service providers perform an act of communication to the public. Article Thirteen, paragraph one, EU parliament vision. All right, so now you might be thinking, all right, Simon, what is up? Where exactly is the problem? What does it mean for you? I really do need to translate what we just heard from the language of the European Parliament. It basically means Youtube would have unlimited liability on the content that stays on that platform to illustrate the impact of this. Let's go back to Tasmania band example. Now they couldn't do see me. They could also sue me and youtube and remember that I mentioned the deep pockets swell. Youtube appsolutely has those other words. According to this legislation, youtube would have to spend millions in losses.

Speaker 1:          09:40          Just think about it because there's such a huge quantity of video going up to youtube and need over 300 hours of videos are uploaded every minute. The chances are many of those videos can have some sort of copyright violation and youtube just needs to have one video with a copyright issue to give them a potentially multi million dollar legal headache. Now obviously youtube cannot deal with that kind of legal exposure, so they have to find a way to avoid it and how do they do that? Well, they have to build a wall, in this case, a very strict firewall. Basically any video with third party content would have to be blocked. Of course, if you're in America, you could still watch it because this law only affects content watched or uploaded inside Europe. So if this gets passed, well, good luck trying to watch videos inside of European. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          10:27          union

Speaker 1:          10:31          and I'm not just talking about people who are purposefully violating copyright here. I'm talking about most videos because it's really hard to work out what is and what. It's not third party content. In fact, it's pretty much almost impossible. Basically everything just beyond a dude talking to a camera with a white backgrounds would have a risk of being blocked and. Well, that actually includes this video because right now I'm going to show you a quote from Donald Trump on CNN. I think you should let me run the country. You run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings, if I may ask the question was present from it and I know what you're going to say. You're probably thinking, well, come on son. You haven't done anything illegal there. I mean that's got to be fair use, right? And yes, you're absolutely right. According to the law, I can use content in this manner for Satta an illustration, but you know what? That youtube firewall isn't a lawyer. It's an algorithm and algorithms don't understand content store the law, so there's brand new youtube far. Well, we'll just say whoa. Third Party content, block it and last Vance and the same goes for when I show you this clip from Tasmania.

Speaker 2:          11:38          Your

Speaker 1:          11:41          is this a legal? No, but good luck trying to make a robot understands legal caveats and really all of my youtube creator comrades watching this video are going to agree with me that there are many problems with the filters on youtube already. So imagine how tough it is going to be when there's an even more aggressive firewall, but hold on a moment because it's not all bad news. There is an alternative indeed, there is a solution. It's a solution that makes everybody moderately happy and that is actually pretty realistic.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Can it be done about this? As I told you before, this copyright directive has been voted on in the European parliaments, but this doesn't mean the legislation has been passed. In fact, we're still in the middle of it all. You see the process to pass an EU directive, it goes as follows. First step, the European Commission creates a first draft. That's how we got the first version of article 13. Second step. This draft goes to the EU parliament. They write another draft and they vote on it. This is why we have another version of article 13, but now there is a third step and a third player coming in and that's the European Council.

Speaker 2:          12:49          So

Speaker 1:          12:54          the European Council is where all of the member states are represented and Oh yes, they have approved another veteran of article 13, so yes, dear view is we don't just have what our for 13, we actually have three different versions. One from the commission, Waterford, the parliament and one from the council. European political institutions are so simple, said no one ever so. Well. What happens next? Well, now we are in the third step, which is when the condition, the parliaments and the council, they get together and they negotiate in Brussels speak. This is cooled of the trial logs

Speaker 1:          13:31          and yes, that is sort of a dialogue, but with three people, like I said, things are never simple in Brussels. Even the words they use, so let's imagine a big room with a big round table. On the one hand we have the commission representative and our advisors on the other. We have the representative of the parliaments and on the other we have the one from the council counseling all of the representatives and advisors. We have over 30 people negotiating. They meet almost every week and you better believe me, it is a long process which probably doesn't surprise you. In this case we have three different texts and believe me, the one from the council is very different.

Speaker 3:          14:12          The absence of the authorization and online content sharing provider shall not be liable for the acts of the communication to the public when it demonstrates that it has made its best efforts and upon notification by rights holders, it has acted expedia mostly to remove or disable access to these works. Article 13, paragraph four.

Speaker 1:          14:37          All right. Let me translate that for you. This means that youtube is liable for the content on their platform, but the liability is missing. Jesus still, we might need to clarify what that means, so let's get back to the Tasmania. For example, with this new lauren hand, Youtube must report to them the songs that are uploaded on the platform and they have to ask them whether they want to take the video down or get a license from it. At this moment, Tasmania will have to add their data and metadata into a form. This way, that filter youtube already has these so called content ID system already knows what to track, but not only that, according to this article 13 version, if youtube shows they have done everything possible to protect the copyright, they cannot be sued. In other words, if youtube plays by the rules, they can avoid a lot of legal uncertainty. Now, yes, they would have to pay more money to the record labels, but there's no existential risk anymore, and of course we. Their content creators would also be happy to because we didn't have to worry about all of our videos being blocked. And finally, of course, the record labels are happy as well because they get what they need. Better conditions for negotiating.

Speaker 1:          15:52          So let me quickly summarize for you what's the difference between the parliament and the council positions? The consequences of the parliaments of Ashton is that European youtube would just become another TV channel. One of the creators you already have a big audience would survive. Why? Because they're the only ones you can pay a lawyer to manage all of the copyright issue so that Youtube will let them upload videos, but there's going to be a pretty big pool and it's going to be pretty impossible to surpass for the hundreds of thousands of small creators, but there is a way to find a common ground for all of the players here, and of course it's compromise and compromise. That's what politics is all about. So now the big question is, well, what comes after this step? What is the fourth step here? While officer, this legislation has been negotiated by the trial logs.

Speaker 1:          16:36          They bring it back to the parliaments that they vote yes or no on the text and then we go to the final step. And this is an EU directive. Now an EU directive is not actually a law, but it's rather a guideline. So after the director of gets passed, it has to go to all of the member states where they turn it international laws, and this is another moment where online creators have to show up and speak to their national governments. And yes, if you're a European youtube creator watching this right now, that includes you. So if there's one thing that we learned from our trip to Brussels is kind of the policymakers, they don't even know you exist, and if they don't know about us as an industry, if they don't know that thousands of people live off creating content online, they will not understand how many people might get unemployed because of a bad regulation. So if you liked this video, rather than asking you to subscribe today, I suggest that you share it with a friend as a creator of Fanny European, hopefully someone who will help make a difference. Now at some point in the future, we're probably going to need to act on this. And here are visual politic. We're going to keep you posted and thank you for watching.
