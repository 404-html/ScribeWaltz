Speaker 1:          00:08          Is to currencies. What tinder is, taps. Everybody loves to criticize it, but at the end of the day, a lot of people wouldn't expect to use it. Totally do. I'm sure many of you have heard economists and experts have all kinds making predictions about the ends of the single European currency

Speaker 1:          00:29          thing Germany could do for Europe is to quit the single currency, but it won't. Larry Elliott for the Guardian Euro, is it patently flawed construct, which it's architects knew at the time of its creation, George Soros. Nevertheless, the reality is way different. In fact, the euro is the second most common worldwide reserve currency and at the end of the video today, you're going to see how it might not be far from being the first and at this point you might be thinking, but the u s dollars fast. There's absolutely no way that's going anywhere, but maybe I'm right. Look, one third of international trade uses the euro as its exchange currency. Twenty percent of the reserve currencies from central banks are denominated in euros and many other countries also issue debt in this currency,

Speaker 1:          01:21          but this is not the end of the story. If you follow visual politic every week, you already know that Donald trump is putting lots of terrorists on international trade. So what does that mean? Well, think about it. If Americans are going to buy less stuff abroad, there will be fewer dollars in circulation. And then you've got to think about who's signing free trade deals with seemingly everyone, and of course that's the European Union. They've already passed a treaty with Canada, the so-called seater, but this is not the only one. In the last two years, Europe has reduced terrorists with Japan, Mexico, and many other countries.

Speaker 1:          01:59          In other words, the more Europeans by abroad, the more euros there will be in circulation. This means that could be a moment where instead of having one hegemonic reserve currency, we might have two US dollar and the euro, so I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. I mean, what good does this really do anyone? Is it actually useful for the Europeans to have the euro as their currency? Well, yeah, and at the same time, no. If you're watching this from a country and you have a company, well having the euro as the world's reserve currency, it's not going to help you,

Speaker 2:          02:39          but if

Speaker 1:          02:39          you're working for a European governments, boy, you're probably feeling really lucky. If there's a big demand for euros, the European Central Bank will have a bigger margins of prince money without devaluing it. Anyway, we actually talked about this in our video about the dollar. If you haven't seen that one yet, you'll find a link in the description below. Check it out after watching this one. Now the big question is why is the euro more popular than any other currency? For example, why the euro and why not the Chinese yuan and why are so many economists critical of the Europe? Well, today we're going to answer these questions, but before we do, as we always do, let's take a look back at the history central crisis. During the seventies, European countries were happy to trade with each other, although there was no European Union back then. There was something very similar and that was the common market.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Nonetheless, there was a problem. Each country had its own national currency at each currency works in a different way. For example, the German market was strong and stable, but the Italian lira was devaluing every other day. You mentioned the situation, you work in a German bank and do you lend a million layers? Do An Italian company at the moment that you lend at a million layers is worth a thousand German marks, but when it's time for that Italian company to give you the money back, the lira has been devalued. So even if you get a million lawyers back when you exchanged Clo who currency, you only get about 900 German marks, not exactly business brilliance.

Speaker 1:          04:17          Alright, so in order to avoid this European politicians, they met together in a room, and I'm really not making this up. Apparently they decided to try something called verse snake in the tunnel. So here's the snake is kind of a metaphor for currency fluctuations because currencies go up and down, like apparently a snake, it goes up and down. So if you don't want the snake to go crazy, you make a tunnel and put the snake in the tunnel. That way the currency doesn't fluctuate. Look for any possible excuse for this sort of analogy was that it was the 19 seventies. Bob Marley was alive. Bell bottoms with trendy. It was just a really different time.

Speaker 1:          04:58          Alright, so importantly, did this snake in the tunnel agreement work? Well? Now your dividends during the 19 eighties, European currencies went up and down like a drunk snake in a very wide tunnel. Trying to continue that terrible seventies metaphor. This is why decades later European politicians met again in another room. This time it was 1992 ads. They had moved on from the ridiculous names of the 19 seventies and they decided to call it the Maastricht treaty. And then this one they got really serious and said, let's not fool around with any more snakes than any more tunnels. That was weird. It was the seventies. Let's just, let's make a currency that everyone can use. There'll be no more exchange rates, there'll be no more fluctuations that we no more bullshit that we had to deal with before. Alright, everyone sound good and then essentially Great Britain post lands up in is like, guys, I don't, I don't. I don't want to end with that. I really liked my pound sterling and everyone else in the room was basically Geico yourself for doing this anyway, and this is how a three step process to create a single currency started.

Speaker 1:          06:02          In 1999, all the stock market started listing in euros and later on European citizens started using the new coins for their daily traits. Today we've all gotten used to hearing about the euro like any other normal currency, but make no mistake. Back then, it was an unprecedented financial experiments and this is how the first critics came to be

Speaker 1:          06:28          exemplifies situation unfavorable to a common currency. It is composed of separate nations, speaking different languages with different customs and having citizens feeling far greater loyalty and attachment to their own country than to a common market or to the idea of Europe. Milton Friedman and I am. One's a. what's the problem? We're the single currency unless easy. If we have a single currency, that German bank we talked about before, we'll have no problems sending money to an Italian or a green company, so. Well, what happens then? Well, since there's no currency risk of German banks, you have a lot of money lender to poorer Italian, Greek and Spanish companies. All of a sudden, rich countries have started to invest in poor countries like there is no tomorrow and yet. Yeah, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. What's the problem with all of this? It sounds pretty great. Well, the problem comes with the crisis.

Speaker 1:          07:27          Banks must take bigger losses on Greek loans, says German finance minister. Basically the southern European economies that poor a weekend when there's a crisis, their companies are the first ones to go bankrupt, so if companies can't pay their debts back, the banks can go bankrupt too, and this is what we call the risk of contagion. This explains why during the 2008 crisis, so many politicians and economists suggested abandoning the euro. One of them talked about the creation of two different years, one for the wealthy countries who are solid and stable and another kind of shitty year for the poorer countries and that kind of week a year a, they'd just be happy to evaluate as they want. Nonetheless, today the euro, it's still alive and kicking and it wasn't split into two different parts. So why was this? Well, let's roll into the next section. The chaos critics are rice. The European Central Bank, also known as the ECB is a modern day tower of Babel. It works similarly to a country's

Speaker 2:          08:30          government.

Speaker 1:          08:35          The current president is a man named Mario Draghi, and the executive board is something like the executive power, but there's also a legislative power and that's the governing council. This is where you have representatives from all of the eurozone countries. This one from Spain, this one from France, Germany, Slovenia, well, all the countries that have the euro as their currency, these guys that the real decision makers, they decide whether to raise or lower interest rates or prince more or less money, but before they do, they have to reach an agreement and this is where the problems really start. The southern European countries, they want to print more money, but the northern neighbors, they don't. Since they can't come to an agreement, it's almost impossible to make drastic decision.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Now this is all true and the problem is, well actually where is the problem? I mean, where is the problem in having a currency that cannot be devalued because those who are in charge of printing is don't agree with each other. I mean, isn't this actually a strength? We've talked about this hundreds of times on visual politic. The best currency is the strongest one. If the value of your money doesn't change, there is low inflation and you can do your shopping without being afraid of losing all your money. You could also, if you wanted to start a tech company, because you know you can invest long term, so now you might be wondering, well Simon is the euro actually that stable? Well, have a look at this

Speaker 3:          09:59          shops

Speaker 1:          10:06          here you can see a comparison between the monetary supply, the so-called m two, if the ECB and the American Federal Reserve. Can you see how they go hand in hand in less than 20 years, the euro has become as solid as the American dollar. In fact, Europeans have already forgotten what infection even is for a better understanding. The American Federal Reserve has two main goals, keeping inflation low and keeping unemployment low as well. European Central Bank instead has just one goal on their agenda and that's monetary stability and so far all they've achieved it. So yeah, we can see that the euro is as solid and abundant as the US dollar, but the question is now, could it be even more solid and even more abundance? And the short answer is yeah. Today the eurozone has around $320 million inhabitants. That's almost the same as the United States, but despite the European economy being smaller than the American one, the euro zone can increase as long as new countries joining.

Speaker 3:          11:06          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:10          the last 10 years, six new countries have adopted the euro as their currency and despite the fact that the political climate is not currently very much in favor of it, Poland or the Nordic countries might end up joining the euro at some point as well. This wasn't enough. There are many other currencies that are linked to the array. Do you remember in a previous video we talked about French colonies in Africa. In that video we said how countries like the Ivory Coast and Senegal have a common currency called the CFA franc. This currency is actually linked to the euro and we're talking about more than a hundred and 50 million people in emerging economies here. In other words, with so many people using euros in their daily lives, there are enough coins out there to make it easy for any company to get their hands on them. As an now you might be thinking, well, yes, I'm in. A lot of people do use the euro, no doubt, but you know who else has a lot of users that Chinese yuan. This is also known as the renminbi and it's becoming more and more fashionable these days. Well, so why are we using euros instead of Renminbi is well, that's

Speaker 1:          12:17          the laws of the UN. Well, you're absolutely right. China is full of a lot of people who are using this currency for that day. You transactions. This means high demand for this currency and lots of notes and lots of coins in circulation. At first glance, this should be enough for the nuance, become an international reserve currency, but there is a problem.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Put 15,000 United States dollars and you will personal cap on overseas bank card withdrawals. Yeah. Yeah. That ride. China does not want us to leave the country. This is why they put lots of capital controls in place. In other words, finding new ones in the international markets. It's not an easy job. In fact, China wants to avoid Chinese businessman taking money out of the country. Hence, the Chinese People's Bank has lots and lots of restrictions and as you can imagine in a dictatorship like that Chinese one, it's hard to believe in the independence of their central bank. In other words, if she needed to, he could simply changed the rules and just stopped printing as much money as he wants it.

Speaker 1:          13:21          Don't believe me. Well, the political system doesn't affect the currency. If you do, you should probably watch a video on Turkey. They all see what happens when you mix authoritarianism and economic crisis and it's not good for now though, it's your turn. Do you think the euro can become as important as the dollar or maybe we see a brand new crisis destroying the European single currency.
