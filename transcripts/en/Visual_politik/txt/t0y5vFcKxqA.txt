Speaker 1:          00:00          Here are the real politic. We love talking about Asia and do you probably know that by now and we like it because there were certain things that this region has the can contribute a loss to the improvements of all. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:13          How was it? Not Everything is as good as it sounds it Asia. While we can certainly see plenty of lights, there are also lots of shadows and the largest shadow is that without any doubt the area has become a huge powder keg ready to blow. On the one hand, the area is spending more and more in weapons. In fact, it is expected that by 2020 the region will accounts for more than 30% of all of the welds military spending. On top of that, it's also becoming a chess board for geo politics. China and India are big emerging powers and with time they are demanding a larger and larger international influence. Putin's Russia has started to feel concerned by the Pacific hands. Well, so as the United States,

Speaker 1:          00:58          this area is extremely important. Now on the other hands, there are many disagreements between the different countries in this region and it seems that lately they have been looking for any reason to start a fight. We can find all kinds of conflicts here back in. I'll make territorial historical, I mean China, China's conflict with Vietnam here with Japan over there, and then there is India. The situation with Taiwan and the problems between Japan and Russia, that's not even considering the situation in Korea. I mean the list just grows longer and longer. We own stalk about many of these, but today we're going to focus on the sleeping giants and that's Japan.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:38          Two nightmares of Japan.

Speaker 1:          01:42          It is the world's third largest economy, but despite that, this country has a modest role in international politics and it's been that way for the last few decades. However, the situation is changing particularly for two reasons. China and North Korea. First, there is the emergence of China as a superpower, but why does Japan care about that? Well, basically because the emergence of China has led to sets Max in Japan's regional influence. Both countries maintain a bit of conflict. Over a small archipelago known as the Senkaku islands.

Speaker 3:          02:14          Senkaku islands are abandoned, but they're still a key area in the fishing industry, be called large deposits, petrol and gas, and there are also strategic in sea trade.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Just take a look at this chart to see how the military budget of both countries has evolved in the last few years. He'll give you a better understanding of Japan is concerned about China's emergent. Second Zahn more recently there is North Korea. How's it been obsessed for the last 20 years about developing unconventional walk capacities. These are mainly being its nuclear capability for now. North Korea has managed to create it. Atomic bomb 30 Keela tons, which is comparable, do twice the bomb that was on her Russia map. They've also succeeded in making ballistic missiles which can reach not only South Korea. There's also Japan.

Speaker 3:          03:07          March, 2017 North Korea launched for ballistic missiles and Japan's direction it was successful and three out of four of them reached Japanese territorial waters, less than 200 miles from the Japanese code

Speaker 2:          03:21          Si.

Speaker 1:          03:23          All of this is producing a real psychosis in Japan. The Japanese government itself has started to conduct evacuation drills in the event of a hypothetical attack and does either distributed a detailed guide to explain how Japanese citizens should respond to to a North Korean nuclear attack. Tokyo says that people should have about 10 minutes to react to that might be an overestimation. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:47          Ms. May

Speaker 3:          03:47          not be detected as soon as it leaves launchpad pending on the case. The warnings and alarms might only sound four or five minutes before a missile arrives.

Speaker 1:          03:58          With all of this going on, we shouldn't be surprised to find out that Japan is acquiring many nuclear shelters as well as equipment for purifying the air, which all designed to fight radiation as well as poisonous gas

Speaker 3:          04:09          lobby the Japanese prime minister has confirmed. North Korea also has the ability to launch serin gas missiles,

Speaker 1:          04:16          so ignoring whether the North Korean threat is real on us. The reality is that China and North Korea are perceived as being significant threats by Tokyo before explaining how the country is planning to fight these threats. Let's have a look at what has been the foundation of their defense policy in the last few decades.

Speaker 3:          04:39          Pat a passivist country,

Speaker 1:          04:43          Japan was one of the countries that lost World War II. As a consequence of this defeats the country had to establish a constitution in 1940 700 that constitution is still enforced today in this constitution. It states that war and the use of force is not to be used unless in self defense.

Speaker 3:          05:01          Firing sincerely to an international piece based on justice and order. The Japanese people forever renounced war as a sovereign right of the nation in order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces as well as other war potential will never be maintained. Article Nine of the Japanese Constitution.

Speaker 1:          05:23          This means that at first the idea was that Japan couldn't even have an army. The country protection was the responsibility of the u s however, the Korean War and the tensions suffered during the years of the Cold War changed everything. All of a sudden, both Tokyo as well as Washington understood it was essential to form a support force for the American army. In case Japan and needed defense and that is how the Japanese self defense forces were born. This is an army whose only possible purpose is defense, but one thing is tree. Formerly the U s still takes cat of Japan's protection and keeps more than 40,000 soldiers deployed in the country and also maintains some of its largest military bases in Japan. This is a forced, by the way, that is co financed by the government of Japan itself. We could even say the Japan is the largest spearhead of the U S in Asia. However, the new threats Japan perceives in the region from China runs North Korea, of course, Japan's and no longer be satisfied with this protection. So the big question is how is Japan responding to these threats?

Speaker 3:          06:27          Are these new diplomacy?

Speaker 1:          06:30          It's the beginning with the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo all they has started an unusual diplomatic race who work against the growing influence of China. For now, he has managed to improve the country's relations with South Korea and to strengthen its bonds with the u s and even bridge the gap existing with Putin's Russia.

Speaker 3:          06:45          Japan maintains an intense dispute over the sovereignty of a small archipelago known as the Kuril islands, which Russia claims is now under their sovereignty.

Speaker 1:          06:55          In fact, the diplomacy are, they has started is so intense that the country is now competing with China in Africa,

Speaker 3:          07:02          Japan and China Compete for African market.

Speaker 1:          07:05          I'm just a curious fact. Shinzo all bay was also the first international leader to meet with trump and the famous residents the American President owns in Florida. It seems like after this encounter all bay manage, do you win over the president's and Macon? Forget all the attacks made against Japan when he was still a candidate for the presidency because one thing is true from complained quite a lot about Japan, but you know, things can change.

Speaker 3:          07:30          Made it to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control. The friendship between our two peoples runs a very, very deep,

Speaker 1:          07:40          of course diplomacy is not always enough

Speaker 3:          07:47          and we are.

Speaker 1:          07:50          And so finally we reached the key points. The Japanese Self Defense Forces often thought of as some sort of small bands of men, but really nothing is further from the truth. The Japanese army is larger than the army of France and the UK combined.

Speaker 1:          08:06          No, it is true that given their name, you may not think that they are important, but the abilities and capacity of this stream, Jami is impressive. Many analysts, they are still the best army in all of Asia, although China certainly competes for that top spot antidote. Japan's investment in defense is quite low with less than 1% of its GDP, but that is still a lot of money. Take a look at this. In 2016 Japan was the country with the seventh highest spending on defense. In 2017 the governments will give, the force is the largest budget in its history, more than 5 trillion yen, which is around $45 billion and of course such a quantity in such a small, and by the way, very well trained army is enough for them to acquire some of the most modern systems available. For example, there's the f 35 the best American drones, the Zulu Pass aircraft, or even the new fifth generation fighter jets, which Mitsibushi is developing.

Speaker 1:          08:59          Japan reveals the prototype of it's splashed furtive fighters. The thing is that since all they became prime minister in 2012 he has had to declare idea of leaving behind the pacifist character sent by the Japanese Constitution Ams. This has happened in 2014 the Chinese government decided to stop all restrictions on the export of warfare material with the goal of starting a new Japanese military industry a bit later in 2015 are they all say ladder reform. So for the self defense forces could operate abroad and today they even have a military base in Djibouti brands. Of course the military budget has increased again, often many years of budget cuts, but not only this, they aren't even thinking about changing the constitution. The radical military shift of Japan echoes the ghost of World War Two so now it comes to the point in the video where we ask what you think. Do you think Japan should leave?
