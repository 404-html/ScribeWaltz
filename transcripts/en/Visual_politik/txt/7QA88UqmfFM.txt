Speaker 1:          00:08          Just before we get started, I do want to say I've got a brand new channel. It's called biographics, longer form, 20 minutes ish. Biographies about notable people from history, not just politicians at all sorts of different folks. Please follow the link in the description below and check it out if you're looking for something else to watch. All right, so in the tax it is the largest fashion distribution on the planet and it's the most successful company in the history of Spain. It's got an annual turnover of $27,000,000,000 and consequently this company has managed to make it into the top 60 largest companies in the world. And if you want a buyer, well then you better have a thick wallet. Get need to spend $125, billion dollars to make the acquisition. Company name might be unfamiliar to some of you, but I am sure you will recognize many of its fashion labels. Look inside this corporation and you'll find such well known brands as Zara. Massimo Dutti, his Stradivarius show, Zahra Parkway, and although smaller, you can also find lefties, they are low cost brand, partly flagship brands of this corporation is definitely Zara. I'm sure you know it's. It's our stores open in almost every country around the world and it is here in Zuora where the corporation makes 60 percent of its total sales for the most striking thing here is not just the figures, it's the company's evolution. It just a few years into Texas, turns into the world's largest textile group with stores on the most expensive streets in the world and it all started as a modest Spanish

Speaker 2:          01:37          in a. This

Speaker 1:          01:47          kind of thing might be less unusual in a country like the USA, but I can assure you it's ratified in such a phenomenon in Spain. That is why we're going to analyze interjects today from its humble beginnings, through the keys to its success, and of course, well, it's immense. Profits, origins of a giant.

Speaker 2:          02:15          No. The

Speaker 1:          02:15          origins of insects. We must go back to the seventies when Spanish businessmen that Amancio Ortega opens the first Zara store. Now you might be wondering, where did Ortega get the inspiration to start out such a profitable moneymaker? Well, it's difficult to say, but we do know this man has been involved with the fashion industry from a very young age. When he was only 14, he was already working as a delivery boy for a well known shirt shop in a small industrial city in the north of Spain. Yup. Times have absolutely changed. Back then, Spain was very different to how it is now. It was a much poorer country and it wasn't unusual to find a 14 year olds in employment, but let's focus it on the thing. Ortega sort was a clear business opportunity and he seemed designed it to make his mark on the international market in 1988.

Speaker 1:          03:02          He opened his first store outside Spanish, borders in Porto in Portugal. Soon after he crossed the Atlantic and set foot in New York and he has been unstoppable since then. The UK, Japan, Kuwait. Right now you can find an intersect store in almost every large city in capital city in the world into tanks, brand owner of Zara and plans to open stores in Vietnam, New Zealand, Paraguay of Aruba and Nicaragua. This year, the voice of Vietnam today into it says more than 7,000, 300 stores across the globe. It's made markets were Intersex, has more shops outside Spain that in China and Russia, as you can imagine, all of there's international expansion. Well, it's certainly had a reward or take it to that child who saw no other choice but to work to survive and do founded into tax when he was almost 40. Is today one of the wealthiest people on Earth. According to Forbes. Ortega's fortune is more than $55,000,000,000 and well there is the billion dollar question. Well, how did he do it? Well, let's take a look at that. Keys to success. As you say that innovation is limited to the realms of the high tech industry. Well, you probably don't know about into tax and pay attention here because we're going to look at how this company has turned the entire textile industry upside down by competing in a very different way to rival company

Speaker 1:          04:29          for textile industry thing. It doesn't exactly sound incredibly groundbreaking does it as well. This company, they've achieved immense growth growth which can mainly be attributed to innovation like daring to be different. Now let's analyze in depth some of the keys to business success first. Well, we need to pay attention to the company's brain. Yes, interface does have some sort of brain and this is the operation room that the company established in our t show. A small town in Galicia. Now you could be forgiven for mistaking. This is some sort of NASA control room, but at least for now, no rockets or satellites have managed from here in this room. They control and analyze everything that takes place across all of the companies. Stores can real time. You see, even though a large part of the clothing production takes place in countries like Morocco, Turkey, Brazil, or Bangladesh, everything or almost everything goes through Spain before it is sent to stores. For instance, let's think about a Zara store in Shanghai. It would be logical for us to think that since the clothes are made in Bangladesh, that they should be sent directly to China from that. Right? Well, that's not what happens at all. They're actually taken to Spain and then they sent back to Asia. This might seem counterintuitive, but it does have an explanation.

Speaker 2:          05:42          No.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Shops sell the same quantity of each type of clothing. The purpose of this operation is to control how much is sold and what's kind of thesis are sent to each of the groups, shops, the model, the color, the size, et.

Speaker 2:          05:55          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Considering this data, the stores receive pieces of clothing as appropriate for that individual needs. It is only logical, for example, that the Zara on Fifth Avenue of does not sell the same items that the Zara's of Miami beach or I bet key to success is logistics, which is closely related to the first one, intersect supplies its doors two or even three times a week, and they can deliver to any of their stores in just 48 hours. You can imagine what's in it for this requires, but with this time in the company, it gets several things in return. They reduce stock in storage and reduce the storage space required in the shops. Less dark means less money and less storage. Space means more space for sale. In all of this means, well of course that means more money. Furthermore, it also helps to have an updated sales line, and this by the way, is the third key to into Texas success. No more lasting collections

Speaker 1:          06:58          company. The clothes aren't often renewed on average every fortnight, so dive Teesha is not selling. It's out just like that in finishes from the shelves and never to be seen again. However, if a piece of clothing is selling well, the customer knows he won't find many people wearing the same products because it's production is limited to a short period of time, so when something is popular in itself as well, the company doesn't provide more of these items. What the designers do is they sort of recycle the model. The essence is kept, but some modifications are made so they follow the trend, but they don't repeat it. It all explains why every time we walk into one of these shops, most of what we see is different to the products we saw the last time. So to sum up with the operation room, daily analysis, logistics, new designs, well, this company is starting to not sound that traditional, isn't it? But I'm sure you probably want to know more about those huge figures. Say, well, let's jump into that now. The large figures,

Speaker 1:          08:01          if there weren't three words to define this enormous player of the fashion industry, these would be well growth, growth, and yeah, the third word would also be growth. Now we've discussed the main keys that have helped to build this empire. So now let's see what's going on within the company and to do this, we need to take a look at the periods between 2006 and 2016 and only 10 years into text has been able to multiply their sales by three. They've doubled the number of stores and they've expanded to 50 new countries. Not so bad for just 10 years. Right? Well, in previous videos like the one we did on Amazon, we said we'd like to highlight the real money company generates. That is the difference between the money that comes in and the money that goes out the cash flow. Well, if we do it again for Inditex, we can see the cash flow has multiplied by three in the last 10 years. If we look at the numbers, we see how this real profit has gone from one point 4 billion euros to 4 billion euros every year. In other words, Mr Ortega System, it's certainly works and this does not just work great for shareholders because inditex has been an absolute employment machine. This company now has more than a hundred and 60,000 workers around the world, but that's not the end of it, not even close because if we bear in mind all the suppliers that inditex works with, that number could be in excess of a million workers,

Speaker 1:          09:29          million people that in one way or another have a drama because of a company that was born in the 19 seventies in a small city in the north of Spain, a company that was founded by a humble man, a worker with ambition. It's all variable.

Speaker 1:          09:46          I. That is why would Tayga has become an idol for many young Spanish school students. They aspire to be like him when they grow up. Spanish high school students want to be like a month ago or take a in the future. Anyway, now I see all. Do you often find yourself shopping in stores even though maybe it never heard of it before?
