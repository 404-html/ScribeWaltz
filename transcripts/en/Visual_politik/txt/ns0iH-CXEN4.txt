Speaker 1:          00:07          I'm going to start today off with a question because I want to know when is the last time you bought a music cd like this one. In fact, this. This is naturally a music cd. This is a CD that my Internet provider sent me to set up my router seriously for the millennials watching this video, compact disc was a thing that had songs on it. Yup. Before the Internet era, if you wanted to listen to music, you actually have to buy it. There was this thing, good, a record shop and there was a cd or a cassette tape and these things can cost up to $30. I know, I know. It all seems pretty bizarre these days going to a physical store to purchase music in less than 20 years, record sales have almost disappeared in the year. 2,000. More than 900 million cds were sold in America alone. Eighteen years later, this number has dropped to 90 million. That's less than a 10th of what it used to be. The reason of course is internet downloads. Platforms like napster, email and torrance have completely changed the industry, and of course you might think in this situation, record labels must be going totally bankrupt, right? Well, I mean actually the opposite is true.

Speaker 2:          01:24          University

Speaker 1:          01:25          music group turned over an average of 17 point $5,000,000 per day in 2017 as the company's annual sales hit record highs topping $6,000,000,000, and this is just one example. Other music companies like Sony, music or Warner are in a similar situation, absolutely record profits sands in case you were wondering, the answer is no. Streaming platforms like Pandora, Deezer, and of course spotify are not enough to explain this phenomenon. For example, Taylor swift is one of the world's most famous artists. Injury now hardly even makes $400,000 a year from spotify listens. Now, this might seem like a lot, but believe me, it is absolute pennies compared with the mega money that Michael Jackson made from the sales of thriller. So why are record labels making so much money? How could they even survive all the illegal internet downloads and file sharing platforms like napster and email? Well, today we're going to answer these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history, creative destruction in the. In 1935, the Union of American musicians published this statement are multiplied and duplicated by the thousands and then sold to and used in places where otherwise musicians would be employed. According to this union, more than 8,000 professional musicians that lost their jobs because of the so-called jukeboxes. A box for those who don't know is a big record plant, sits in a bar or restaurant so you can insert a coin and choose a song that you want

Speaker 1:          03:00          by the end. Nineteen 35, more than 135,000 machines like this one was sold throughout the United States, but at the same time that those 8,000 traditional musicians were taken out of business, Benny Goodman was signing a million dollar contract with a label called RCA victor. The business model of the music industry had already changed forever. Prior to this, musicians lived off the money they made from concerts. In fact, the first music records swept used as advertising for the life performances, but now 90 percent of their income was coming from record sales. This is a process which we call creative destruction,

Speaker 1:          03:45          but this was more of an economic shift. The way we listened to music changed forever as well. All of a sudden, some local music genre started being enjoyed nationwide, for example, of jazz music was a typical genre in New Orleans, but it ended up expanding all over America and not only that, this also changed the way that we understood music. Think about it before we could record music, musicians could only do live performances. That maximum audience was just a few hundred people. Suddenly radios and records allowed them to reach millions and this way it made a whole lot more money is how a new genre was created, a musical style made for radio, and that's of course rock and roll. This is a style of music that originated in America and ended up expanding to all parts of the West from Los Angeles to Berlin rock stars. We're no longer just simple artists. They were engines inside of a complex machine, the record label, paying for marketing campaigns, organized massive concerts, and even negotiated advertising deals for them and meanwhile the Rockstar gave the whole industry a young, fresh face

Speaker 1:          05:04          is why wild about is like Elvis and the Beatles became millionaires. The big companies. It just got bigger and bigger. Since then, music was not just listened to all across the developed world. A record like Michael Jackson's thriller could sell more than 66 million copies in a brand new market that stretched from La to Tokyo. By the in 1999 in the music industry had reached its ceiling. Well, there's $1,200 million records had been sold. The business was bigger than the GDP of a country like the Dominican Republic. And what happens when an industry generates so much money? Well, the big guys start eating the smaller for a better understanding. In that moment, 78 percent of the industry was concentrated in just five big multinationals. And then when the music industry was the ultimate moneymaking machine, something rather surprising habits. Remember that thing I said about creative destruction? Well, if there's one good example of positive distraction, it's napster. Napster was the first software that allowed users to download songs in MP three format in a fast free and of course illegal way from one day to the next. Those records that could cost $30 could be found for free online, and as you can see on this chart, this was the beginning of the end.

Speaker 1:          06:30          Even though napster lost a case in the courts, it was already too late. The music business had already changed forever. At the end of the day, why would you buy something if you can get it for

Speaker 2:          06:40          great,

Speaker 1:          06:44          but just hold on a minute here because I haven't looked at the chart again, if you pay attention, you'll see that despite a dramatic decline in record sales, the profit for company is like universal music group hasn't actually changed that much. Why? Well, let's explain that right now. Size matters drillers. 8,000 musicians that lost their jobs in 1935. Well, in the year 2000, something similar happened. Universal music, fod, 4,000 people practically overnight. This was 34 percent of their staff at this point, record sales were almost 90 percent of their income and those sales, they were falling by 20 percent. Yeah, often. Yeah, and this moment is when the executives of the big record labels started singing the same old tune that we've been talking about over and over again in this video, and of course creative destruction if they wanted to survive that to make a 180 degree shift to the company, they had to stop being a record label and start becoming a music label. Oh, okay. But you know, what does that actually mean? Well, let's have a look at the example of universal music reading. The first step for creative destruction is of course destruction.

Speaker 1:          08:06          In the past decade of the 21st century, universal got rid of everything that was not making it any money. What was that? Well, that would be the record. Manufacturing factories, they sold as many of those things as possible. And what's next up in creative destruction? Well, of course, that's creativity with all the money they got from selling the factories. Universal bought all the music labels they possibly could. The main goal was to expand them, use a catalog as much as possible, which explains news like this, universal music group purchases, Emi music label group will acquire catalogs of the Beatles. Pink Floyd, radiohead and more so what happens after some creative destruction like this? Well tastes to musical genres. They changed. For example, we have k pop with songs like gangnam

Speaker 2:          08:54          style

Speaker 1:          08:59          genre in South Korea. That's ended up expanding to the rest of the wells. Yep. Of Us in the 19 thirties, the music industry was limited to the United States then in the eighties and it expanded throughout the West. Now in the two thousands, music is a 100 percent global industry and companies like universal have bought labels in every market. You could have

Speaker 2:          09:23          university.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Oh, music science. Ten cent deal for China expands music group to relaunch emi records in.

Speaker 2:          09:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Bursal buys majority stake in Kenyan label ai records and now you might wonder, okay, but no matter how many labels you have by, if people don't buy music anymore, you're income's going to fold inevitably. Alright. Well, yeah. Yeah. You are right. In fact, the music industry today is nothing but a shadow of what it used to be so well. What's the difference? Well, now, despite the cake being smaller, oh, way less people using, as you can see on the chart, 72 percent of the industry is covered by three big multinationals, universal, Sony, music and Warner, and yes now is when we start talking about spotify, as we said before, spotify gives various or money to the artists. 1 million listens only means about $7,000, but when you have the rights of 25 percent of the music produced in the world, even if you make one point zero, $0 per listen, you're still become a million app today. Record sales, they've gone from being 90 percent of the industry's profits to just $25

Speaker 1:          10:46          and streaming music represents six out of every $10 entering the music industry. Of course, this is great news for multinational corporations which make more and more money that as you can imagine, this is not so good news for the musicians. It's harder and harder to make money with music and this is why you need to be extremely popular to make any money out of this. On the other hand, those three big labels aren't willing to risk what they have by experimenting with new formulas, but always a minute because this is not so bad. If you've been following the news and the music industry lately, you'll probably see that there's a bit more room for some creative destruction.

Speaker 1:          11:28          Now let's artists bypass labels and upload their own music. Yes, do you is if you have a bands, you can now upload your songs directly to spotify and get your royalties without a middleman way, and by the way, if you do make good music and you want some free advertising, do send us.
