Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:08          in this video, we are going to take a look at the career of one of the most surprising and controversial figures of the century. The figure is Mikhail Saakashvili. Wait a second, you don't know him. Well, imagine a person who is capable of being one of the best allies of Washington and at the same time one of the greatest enemies of flatten map Putin. He was president of one country, a candidate to preside over another and today beat doesn't even have a nationality. This is a man how politician worthy of starring and his very own political thriller. In fact, I would imagine they probably wouldn't be surprising to see a netflix original produced about this guy

Speaker 1:          01:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:09          This is today's character for visual politic. It is Mikhail Saakashvili.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Maybe a

Speaker 2:          01:19          be shoved the governor. What does it start our story? We need to go back to maybe the 30th 2015 but that's a petro Poroshenko. The president of Ukraine appointed may coming Elsa Cash Villi as the governor of the province of a Dessa.

Speaker 1:          01:35          With it

Speaker 2:          01:36          position Misha was given Ukrainian nationality. However, to becoming Ukrainian citizen, he had to give up citizenship from his home country, Georgia, the country he had led US president between 2004 and 2013

Speaker 1:          01:49          yes.

Speaker 2:          01:51          Addition to the Ukrainian government was quite the treat for the media band. Well, that's only logical. You see at that time your crane was going through a really tense situation after the circled maidan revolution and the fall of pro Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. That was almost a feeling of civil war in Ukraine, a war between Kiev supporters and supporters of Moscow, and Odessa was one of the most pro Russian provinces. So you can imagine the picture of the foreign ex presidents and not just any ex president, but what of Putin's worst enemies appointed as the governor of a, this event was hugely discussed in all the national media as well as the international press, the president of Ukraine, who was, by the way, in old friends and fellow college students of meshes, Petro Poroshenko. Describe to Misha as the man who makes possible the impossible, pretty flattering, right at that time, their friendship when it seemed bulletproof. Well, the mission of the new governor was to stabilize a dessa grounds power to Kiev, chase corruption, and sets the groundwork for the region to prosper in order to carry it all out to make sure. Brought in many of his former collaborators from Georgia. He also hired many young professionals to be thought to be corruption free like Yulia and Mary chef's got an activist who became famous here on Youtube. But with the video, I am a Ukrainian. Misha also brought in some people from Putin's opposition in Russia, like the Russian activist, Maria guider who was appointed vice governor. No.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Yes.

Speaker 2:          03:19          That was a lot to do and it had to be done fast, so wow. As it was sad. So it was done.

Speaker 1:          03:29          One

Speaker 2:          03:30          See, took the Odessa governorship. The new governor started a thorough investigation to find and punish corrupt public workers. He changed most of the high level positions in the public administration. He's simplified the process for creating companies and introduced independent controls and even liberated public beaches that had been illegally occupied so that once again Adesa citizens joy them. Hold on a second tier because Misha has a strange work methodology and it is as effective as it is controversial. If anything doesn't work properly and does corrupt, he just dismantles it. He fires all the workers and he sets it up again. He did the same during his time in office in Georgia with the traffic police anti threatened to do it again with the Odessa port, the largest commercial port in Ukraine, well known for bribes and payments to customs officers. You need to fire them all. We have 130 new people.

Speaker 2:          04:20          They are young, new and trained and the old ones are hopeless. He Calls Saakashvili in the end though here and you have to follow some of the customs officers so that the corruption would stop. Consider this. A number of businessmen noted that bribes at the port really had stopped in recent months, mainly because people were scared of becoming the next victim of one of soccer stability is public anticorruption tirades rates. Shawn Walker, correspondent of the Guardian with all these changes and with the help of me, she has contacts. ADESA started to receive help from the USA and since we should didn't trust the police, the first thing he did was establish an independent police force to fight corruption.

Speaker 1:          04:57          One

Speaker 2:          04:58          has a police force that was organized and trained by the FBI and the California Highway Patrol, so it looks like everything was going pretty good. Right. Well just hold on a second because both sac is really and his team soon realized that it was going to be much, much harder than they anticipated. The problem was that Odessa was not a battlefield of Kiev supporters versus pro Russians, but it was a battlefield between the rule of law and an oligarchy that has dominated Ukraine at, since it's independence kingdom of all the guards, more and more experts have said, so your cranes biggest problem is not a Russia. It is the oligarchy corruption in Ukraine is so embedded that we could almost say it is a sort of feudal country where the nobility or of course these mighty oligarchy

Speaker 1:          05:54          thanks. They

Speaker 2:          05:56          control the, the political power, the administration, even the media, almost nothing escapes that power which is consolidated both by money and by fear. Then level of impunity is almost absolute police, government judges that all a part of the game. Things have been this way since you crane got its independence, but since the maidan revolution, it's all got a whole lot worse after the fall of the pro Russian president vixy you knock a bitch and with the civil conflict to the country was going through the new government felt incapable of trusting the army, all the police. Since both institutions were corrupt, they were disorganized and they were badly equipped. That is why he made a decision. He appointed several oligarchs is governors of some of the most vulnerable regions in the country. These oligarchs paid for that own private armies and with nice incentives, the police followed their orders as well.

Speaker 2:          06:46          Earning a sum for the heads of every separatist. Yeah, but as I told you, the government essentially placed the mafia directly in charge of several governorships. Oh, that was the case for e Hok. Hello Boyski who was appointed governor of Denise [inaudible]. I'm sorry if I'm screwing the pronunciation up on that. This took like 17 takes. This region is one of the most important in the country. Economically speaking. So yes, this is the Ukraine Mikhail Saccos philly was dealing with. There was not a single state enterprise in Ukraine that has not been usurped by one clan or another. I verus Abramovic. Yes, former minister of economy and trade of Ukraine. As you can imagine, all these oligarchs did not welcome Misha or his reform agenda. Indeed, once he was even kicked out of an interview when he suggested all of these mafia members have to be sent to prison, that the media is also the property of the oligarchy. The thing is Misha soon started to work to fight and ultimately ends the situation.

Speaker 2:          07:43          I will do whatever it takes for complete victory to read new crane of this filth of this corrupt scum which capitalize on the blood of our soldiers whose only motivation in life is to fill its own pockets, strengthen its own clan and bleed Ukraine dry, Mikhail Saakashvili and so he did Misha. It started to publicly report all kinds of influence, peddling favorable treatment and privileges. On one occasion he even came on national television and reported the details that they corrupt scheme of the airlines owned by column Boyski and oligarch. You'd nearly obtained a monopoly on national flights. The public reports ended the situation and took many of the people involved to course. Let's, as you can imagine, Mr Colin [inaudible] didn't take it well. He promised to get his revenge and here's what he said about satish civilian public. When a dog without a muscle bite someone, we need to punish both the dog and more importantly the owner. He Horror Calamos Ski. Now, Dino thing that all Meesha did was report the oligarchs. Not at all.

Speaker 1:          08:41          Okay,

Speaker 2:          08:42          train crash Saakashvili is reforms in Odessa didn't complete the work. Many of them were stops and sabotage by the government in Kiev. This wasn't just the audio gox. You see, corruption was so commonplace that it was difficult to tell the difference between the Mafia and the authority.

Speaker 2:          09:04          Nisha, he didn't think twice the government became his target. Many analysts claim that this new war against the government had a hidden agenda to take a leap. International politics. Well, maybe, but the thing is, he did it. He started by reporting the corruption of the very prime minister. Our any Yatsenyuk man's many ministers followed this. Evil included his own friends. The president's Petro Poroshenko, the person who had placed him in a Dasa. What difference for Ukrainians does it make who will treat them like dirt Poroshenko or you're kind of itch? What difference? Who will steal from them? Mikhail Saakashvili, the friendship that didn't last long as we have seen Poroshenko appointed meesha governor in May of 2015 in just a year. The battle it, yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Gone.

Speaker 2:          09:48          Finally in November, 2016 at resigned as governor and began his own political party. The M N F I hadn't see soon gains more than 20,000 members. Yup. The former Georgian presidents now wanted to lead Ukraine and his own words. Yes, fine. To turn this disaster of a country into a complete European super. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          10:11          Am I now be wondering about the responsive Poroshenko ans the government to this campaign and pay close attention here in July, 2017 Poroshenko took advantage of the fact that there's a, Misha was in the USA and he revoked his Ukrainian citizenship. All of a sudden, Mikhail Saakashvili was a stateless person. Now if thing that stopped him, you are absolutely wrong. Look, when his nationality, it was taken away. Misha, he simply moved opponents and we have to say, Michelle is a well loved guy in eastern Europe. In fact, many countries offered him citizenship, but nope bishop, he was determined to go back to Ukraine as well. That's exactly what he did. Despite the warnings of the government to give on September the 10th surrounded by a supportive crowd. Michelle crossed the border on foot between Poland and Ukraine. The images of his confrontation with the border guards. Well, they're quite

Speaker 1:          11:00          nice.

Speaker 2:          11:20          What do you think is up to now that he's back despite his irregular situation? Nisha, he's campaigning around the country, but all of that said there is still an important question. Why out [inaudible] Philly,

Speaker 2:          11:35          the Saakashvili Revolution in 2003 Michelle at a popular uprising against the corrupt George and political system of Eduard Shevardnadze and then what is known as the Rose Revolution. He even made it to the Georgian parliament. Elections were held mans as the successful revolutions. Nida Saakashvili easily beat the rest. The reform process that started there was a fierce fight against corruption and a tough policy towards Moscow. That came to be a model for the former Soviet countries.
