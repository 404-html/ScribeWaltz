Speaker 1:          00:07          It's so good just for one week, one week was really all the time that was needed for this man. The president of the United States stab his first diplomatic crisis. So who was this crisis with? Well, you can probably guess the answer is Mexico. Mexico. Mexico is the new China. Mexico is killing us. The country of Mexico is killing us. Donald trump is well, let's say unique. He might be the only head of state capable of defying in public a foreign presidents in this case. That's opinion. Yet though, like telling him on twitter if doesn't travel to Washington with the idea of paying for the wall, he may as well stay at home. Needless to say, the visit never happens. Live Travis Mikiko, but don't worry. View as we've had enough trump talk to the donald is not going to be the main character in this video. Today we're going to focus on the Nafta agreement and especially on the relationship between Mexico and the United States of America. Laughter is a free trade agreements between the US, Canada, and Mexico. It was negotiated by President George H, w Bush in 1992, and it was ratified and implemented by Bill Clinton in 1995.

Speaker 2:          01:20          Hey,

Speaker 1:          01:26          Nafta has been supported both by Democrats and the Republicans, but let's take a look back and analyze which events took place. South of the Bravo Riverton.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:36          let's travel back and tell him to the 19 eighties. It's telling. When Mexico was exhausted, the country's economic model was a worn out closed economy and they were in a state of crisis. In fact, it was a dance hall. Him with a massive immigration from Mexico to the US started to happen and it wasn't just any migratory wave. It was one of the biggest migration waves of all time

Speaker 1:          02:09          and all of this happens in a time when Americans weren't particularly liked in Mexico since the war with the US from easy 46 to 18, 48 when Mexico lost more than half of its territory. The popular sentiment in the country was that the US was a great villain and an enemy that Mexico was facing by 1988. It was clear that Mexico is closed. System was worn out and the president of Mexico, who at the time was Carlos Salinas, a Harvard graduate by the way, decided to end this and opted for opening up Mexico to the outside world in his own words, the US is not the worst threat that have the best opportunity and the leaders in North America decided they didn't want to waste this chops. They got down to business and decided to bet on extending to Mexico a free trade agreements that they had recently signed with Canada with this. Nafta was born. Since then, relations between the U S and have expanded a great deal. It is estimated the trade between the two countries today exceeds half $8,000,000,000,000. Now a half a trillion, which is $500. Million dollars is quite a hard number to get your head around in more relatable terms each minute. So that means more than a million dollars worth of products crosses the border of the U, s and Mexico,

Speaker 1:          03:25          or to put it in a more international context, trade between the US and Mexico is the equivalence of the Chilean economy and does more than the entire economy of Argentina. The Gardens, American President, Donald Trump threatens this agreement. Sam does even considered putting an end to it because according to him, it is the worst agreements that the US has ever signed. Nafta is the worst trade deal ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. Now that's just what he says and the reality. Well, bits rob. The difference after has in general been something of a goldmine for the United States.

Speaker 1:          04:04          It has been said that whenever trump has a nightmare, it's always the same thing he sees and Mexicans stealing. Here's what your company anyway, we don't know if this is true bits, probably nice, but it would explain his obsession with Mexico and also why whenever he thinks of Nafta, he thinks of the American people getting robbed, but zone thing that it is only the president you holds in his opinion, they need defenders of protectionism. In the US stated that Mexican and Canadian workers are causing American jobs to disappear because of free trade. Specifically, they claimed that imports exceed exports by almost $80, billion dollars, and that's a lot of money, but the reality is that these figures are about as reliable as a chocolate teapot. First, there are two goods that twists those numbers which have nothing to do with Nafta, petrol and natural gas. And this is really important because if we don't consider those products that treat all that trump is talking about pretty much disappears.

Speaker 1:          05:08          Now, some of you are probably thinking, well, Simon, why wouldn't you consider petrol and natural gas? And that's a good question. Well, that's because unless trump wants to take the United States back to the Stone Age, he will have to keep getting all the petrol the country needs, whether that's from Mexico, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Orwell, well anywhere else, but these budget figures aren't the only ones. The protection is dreamers also fudged the biggest for. They also do this by not considering service businesses. This includes things like the financial sector, the insurance sector, traveling, consulting, the Internet, etc. And etc. Etc. But ignoring these things is like sAying the banks don't make money and the google simply doesn't exist. So if we adjust these two figures, it turns out that the us' results is not a deficit, but it's actually a surplus that's true for both Mexico runs, whether it's Canada, it's actually a surplus of more than $40 billion

Speaker 2:          05:58          donuts.

Speaker 1:          06:03          The americans are really the ones who are making off like bandits in this trade relationship. All right, but in mExico it's a bit different because even correcting the numbers, the us still gets the deficits in this relationship. So the question is, what is the actual number? Well, waiver, it's approximately in drum roll. Please zero point five percent of its gdp. Yes. I'm sorry to disappoint you. It is really that missile. In fact, the deficit is actually smaller than the one they have with China, Japan or Germany. Almost all american industries export to Mexico more than the emBossed with the exception of autism.

Speaker 1:          06:56          You can guess where the profits are going to end up, but there is more. It is said that the main reason for the company's moving that factories to Mexico is because the wages are lower, but that's only half the truth and certainly isn't the main reason. What's interesting about Mexico for car companies is that Mexico has many more free trade agreements with other countries than the us does and this allows them to produce and sell their cars in other markets like Brazil and the european union without terrorists, which saves them a lot of money. About $700,000,000 a year.

Speaker 2:          07:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:30          The benefits of these operations getting to end dump. Yes. Once again, back in the pockets of the United States of America, john salon cabins with casinos. The house always wins, so thanks to Mexico. Car companies in the usa are more competitive and to have more profits. Well, consumers in America combine much cheaper. All of this, americans have more money to go to the senator, to buy clothes, to change their small phones more often and take part in all that consumer spending that we all love so much. This all makes the economic wheels spin them faster.

Speaker 2:          08:04          Boss

Speaker 1:          08:11          now probably seems to you, yeah, Mexico is actually pretty important to the usa, but imagine the other way round. Almost 80 percent of mexican exports ends up in northern neighbor, so it's no surprise that the threat of the ends of nafta has reminded many of the famous quotes attributed to porfirio, diaz, Mexico. It's so far from god and so near the usa. Nafta has been incredibly positive than Mexico. As a quick example, do you know which is the biggest employer in Mexico? Well, that's

Speaker 2:          08:42          unfortunately really

Speaker 1:          08:42          this huge investment by us companies hasn't actually given the growth that was expected and for the reason for that, so we need to look at responsibility inside Mexico itself. Now, the truth is the mexican politicians don't know how to advantaGe of this fantastic opportunity to make Mexico more modern and more competitive, and does he know bad politics equals bad, right

Speaker 2:          09:02          results.

Speaker 1:          09:07          All of this means that Mexico has to kneel in front of Donald Trump. Well, sesame, not

Speaker 2:          09:18          Donald Trump,

Speaker 1:          09:19          threatens Mexico with high tariffs on their products. If they refuse to pay for the wall to be specific, trump's administration is threatened. A 20 percent tariff increase for starters weld. This would be illegal. There are rules in the world trade organization that prevent this from happening. One of these is known as the most favored nation, which means that one member of the wto cannot discriminate against another, in fact, to this means that the maximum tariff would be limited to three percent in the case that nafta were abolished. This would be a tax for consumers and american companies and wouldn't affect the trade between the two nations, but even if the u s with the approval of congress were willing to ignore international law, Mexico has enough resources to fight and try and stop this first at Mexico would be able to take advantage of the influence of the multinational corporations operating in Mexico, which could stand to lose billions of dollars and this is not just the influence of a few rich men were talking about all of these companies, workers and their shareholders as well as millions of individual savers throughout the United States and the second reason, well relations between Mexico and theu , s on just commercial immigration, drug trafficking, terrorism.

Speaker 1:          10:24          TheSe are just a few aspects of that relationship. If trump attacks economically, Mexico could find back, for example, by letting the us drown in drugs and immigration waves from countries all across latin America. The fact is that the u, s and Mexico need each other more than it seems, and Mexico is not seen as weak of a position as trump thinks. Although the president is in Mexico is unpredictable. It does look like he understands this and the message from his government is clear. Let's talk about nafta. We can renegotiate this treaty, but then all these other treaties, so we're also going to be open to negotiation. It's like this is what we think's going to happen here, a visual politic, and we'd love to know what you think. Do you think Mexico should defend itself tooth and nail even with the risk of triggering a trade war with the United States, or do you think the nation should be patient to let things go and look for a solution elsewhere? Let us know in the comments below. We do read them and we tried to reply when we can. Don't forget that we put up brand new videos every monday and thursday, so do not forget to subscribe and as always I'll see you in the next video.

Speaker 3:          11:21          I think I'm going to win the mexican vogue. Mexico, Mexico, Mexico. We have a problem called Mexico. Mexico's killing us. Mexico's killing us. Mexico is the disgusting Mexico. They're killing us. jeff alarm, gray pedelec. When I don't care if I mispronounce it doesn't matter.
