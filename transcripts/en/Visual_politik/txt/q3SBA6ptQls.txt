Speaker 1:          00:00          It's the second most populated country on earth. Seventh biggest economy.

Speaker 2:          00:05          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07          One of the 10 biggest military budgets in the world and is a nuclear power. India is a stranger in political terms. If I were to ask you, who's the prime minister of India, could you tell me? No. I am aware that many of you will actually know this, especially if you're watching this video from India, but if you don't know who the prime minister of India is, don't worry because. Well, that happens a lot

Speaker 1:          00:44          on the 26th of May, 2014 after an absolute majority, which had not been seen in 30 years. Narendra Modi became the prime minister of India. Moody's mission, whether it was clear boost growth investments, and to create millions of jobs in conclusion, turn India into a superpower capable of competing with China on an economic, political, and military level. Gene Kim, how todd? You know India because you're a politic view is, is something all on eternal promise. It's always that country that seems to be the next one that's going to take off, but it never really does. Where you can see that this is definitely the case. If we take a look at India's GDP and compare it to that of China,

Speaker 1:          01:33          they seem quite different economic development in the last few decades, so with Moody's victory expectations all, once again, high end, India has again become the talk of the town. Moody is repeating over and over again. The 21st century is going to be India's century. Well, before we get into all of that, let's take a look at boody himself. Oh, he's Narendra Modi, vegetarian, single ends, a yoga enthusiast, Modi escapes the traditional politician profile. He comes from a family of limited means and when he was a child, used to help his father sell tea in a train station. This has helped him and the sympathy of many poor people in the country. They see him as an example of a rags to riches story and shows that rags to riches in India can sometimes work. His political ideology has always been very attached to Hinduism and he is not always taken a moderate approach. In fact, before getting involved with the BJP party, he was involved with the rfs as potty. The RSS Party isn't extreme rights policy that had Mahatma Gandhi's assassin as one of its members for 13 years, between 2011 and 2014. Moody was the regional Prime Minister in the state of good Gerard Gerard. It's 65 million inhabitants has become numb to Moody's leadership, India's greatest economic driver with an annual growth rate of 10 percent.

Speaker 1:          03:01          It's like these impressive figures. Social Welfare has also greatly improved. Almost every home has access to the plumbing, electricity, and preschool education. While the general election in India was taking place, moody promised to replicate what he'd done in his state in the rest of India. Furthermore, he promised to do this in just 10 years, which is only two political terms,

Speaker 3:          03:20          Lauren Nigga, we did look by his dish arms, arms, shit, abuse, because I've magical Niggas don't niggas.

Speaker 1:          03:30          This is because for Moody, the Year Twenty, 22 is a landmark. Yeah. It's the 75th anniversary of India's independence. The country will also support us, China as the world's most populous country. Reaching a population of one point 6 billion people, Moody says that by the year 20, 22, it's going to be clear that the 21st century is India

Speaker 2:          03:51          century.

Speaker 1:          04:00          This is certainly not going to be easy, especially in a country where the population is growing by 28 people every minute.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Yes, measure problem. Now India has many problems, but three, do you stand out as particularly important? The first is that India is a bureaucrat's paradise. In fact, if bureaucracy was the key to prosperity, India would probably be the most prosperous country in the world. Unfortunately though bureaucracy instead of encouraging business actually prevents it. John Cody has blamed the Indian bureaucracy for putting roadblocks in the group of Indian economy. According to the doing business report from the wells bank, which estimates how easy it is to do business in India occupies the 130th position each step of the way to establishing a business in India takes a ton of documents and then the taxes are not only high. Not that anyone really pays them, but they are also a nightmare to sort out, for example, on not only different taxes in each individual state, but there are sometimes different taxes for each individual product or different models of the same product. This is something that commonly happens with vehicles and it is a real nice math. Anyone to work out

Speaker 3:          05:18          Katina with the hand or they buddy nick lingered further.

Speaker 1:          05:25          DSM among public workers has reached such a critical state that some hospitals have been forced to closed temporarily because of the lack of staff. The second big problem is that regulations in the marketplace make it so complicated that the market is barely able to function on the borders between different states. You'll find trucks that are just cuing to cross the border. Not a few people say that it's actually easier to import something from abroad than it is to get something from another state. Further, there is the terrible state of the country's infrastructure as well. Estimated that half of the country's harvest goes to waste every year because of these delays. And the third big problem is that corruption is a big issue in Indian society. As a quick example of this, it is estimated that 50 percent of all money that the government gives for welfare either ends up in the hands of corrupt politicians or middlemen. And so this is the country for Moody, is having to deal with

Speaker 2:          06:24          government policies.

Speaker 1:          06:28          Some have suggested it has not yet taken place. However, the truth is is that the government has achieved some notable advances. For example, we could highlight the following in order to reduce bureaucracy. The government has created a committee with the purpose of determining which rules and regulations are obsolete and should be eliminated. So far they've done away with more than 1700 of these rules. Moody has eliminated many restrictions on foreign investments is past the first bankruptcy law. And to set up a powerful planet to make India a destination for business

Speaker 1:          07:01          is also set forth an ambitious plan for better financial inclusion. This plan has a pretty unpronounceable name, so I'm just going to show it on the screen now. And this plan has basically allowed for people to have a bank account for the first time, the number of people who've taken this up, it's about $200 million. And this basically means that that welfare money that is coming from the government, it doesn't have to go through any middlemen further. The government has also put forth a plan to simplify a very complicated tax system. Having a flat sales tax at the national level.

Speaker 2:          07:32          There's also

Speaker 1:          07:32          announced that they're going to be spending a lot of money on infrastructure with a hundred and $30,000,000,000 being spent on rail by 2020. So again this year, our plan is to really connect a lot of these small towns and cities to the main national highway and, and the target or the government is to construct 10,000 kilometers of road every year. But these aside, Moody's most risky moves so far happens in November of 2016 mbs cash crisis. In order to fight corruption, India suddenly made the countries 501,000 rupee notes illegal. These represented 85 percent of all of our cash in India. A country that is really a cash based economy, the goal was to find dirty money and punish it when the owners came into the bank to switch out that 500 and the phenols and notes for ones in the new design. However, the plan was an utter disaster.

Speaker 1:          08:26          The government didn't have enough cash to replace the money that people wanted to exchange. Further, the country's atfs weren't working properly because the new currency was a different shape to the old currency and the ATM is hadn't been adjusted. I don't know what to do. People here have no money to buy my products so I can't buy stock from the market either. It's the end of my business. This was a botched operation that left the country moneyless and caused significant damage to the economy. Sales fell in November. By more than 30 percent. Many businesses simply weren't able to pay workers, and many business transactions have to be canceled. Some studies estimate that the total damage was two points of India's GDP. This would mean for the bank note switch cost India. $50,000,000,000 ends. Unfortunately, the poorest in the country were the hardest hit. Then the government tried to save, but it was all part of some big plans who encourage people to use more electronic money, a politician foreign policy agenda. Now this is the field where the prime minister has really excelled. In his first year alone, he visited my new team members

Speaker 1:          09:39          that he's only been in power for a short amount of time, that he has a treatment, some notable advances. The Pakistan treaty has improved India, Pakistan, one relationship. It's a relationship with China, has started dealing with some economic and commercial issues. At a joint press conference, President Xi Jinping announced 20 billion US dollars worth of investment in India's infrastructure in five years. However, without any doubt, the greatest strength of Moody's political agenda has been his approach to the United States. The chemistry between Obama and Moody has been quite significant and their encounters have been frequent and friendly. They have both even published an article altogether in the Washington.

Speaker 1:          10:17          What we really need to ask now is we'll moody achieve his goals. That I'll certainly a great deal of challenges that he is going to have to overcome. For example, it's been made clear to the prime minister just how tricky it is, but the limits on bureaucracy further moody has avoided many essential reforms such as ending India's labor regulation, which has mentioned that four out of every five jobs in the country are on the gray market. Moody claims to be an admirer of Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore's ex prime minister Modi doesn't seem to have the same drive or determination to transform India's model. So this is just our opinion here, revisional politic, and we would love to know what you think. Do you think that the 21st century is going to be India Century? Do you think that Modi is going to achieve all that he has set out to achieve? Do let us know in the comments below? We'd love to hear from you.
