Speaker 1:          00:07          So have you guys have requested faster, make a video about France now Francis, one of the wealthiest countries in the welds. Yes. One with some of the artists, economic problems today. France is the second largest economic power in the European Union bus that might not last for much longer. They youth unemployment rate is over 23 percent in their public debt is twice as big as that entire GDP. Ten years ago, the entire world was buying Renno cars or Alcatel mobile phones, but today French experts of almonds are half of what they used to be just a short time ago. Their companies are simply unable to face the competition that's coming from China, from South Korea, rob, even from the United States in general. And as you can imagine, this economic crisis has had a great effect on French society. If you don't believe me, let's just have a look at the presidential elections of this year. That's 2017. None of the candidates from the traditional parties have made it to the second rounds. French voters are simply fed up with their political establishment, and this is why they've chosen a politician who wants to make a one 80 shift in the French

Speaker 2:          01:18          system.

Speaker 1:          01:22          You might be wondering what are the reasons behind this French crisis and more importantly, what is macron propose in order to solve it all today, we're going to answer that question, but before we get started, as usual, let's take a look at the history,

Speaker 2:          01:37          right

Speaker 1:          01:38          is to the French people. Right after World War Two, all the European powers were on the verge of bankruptcy men. This included France, half the country was destroyed by bombing and this included houses as well as factories. Luckily enough though, Uncle Sam was there and then he was ready to

Speaker 2:          01:54          hell no

Speaker 1:          01:59          states was interested in having a strong Europe say that the consonants could purchase goods from them. This lead duty, so called Marshall Plan being put into place. It was a cash injection of billions of dollars, which would lead to the reconstruction of the European nations, but do hold on just a minute because each of these countries use the finance in very different ways. For instance, the German government created that political theory called auto liberalism, a gay social liberalism. This was a combination of social programs and free enterprise. In other words, the government would provide a safety net for their citizens and subsidize the companies as well, but on the other hand is these companies were privates as they could compete with them. A very, very different case. Back then, the president was general Charles de Gaulle, and he was no friend of free enterprise, so his political theory, Deer Ridge Ism was pretty different from that of the gym.

Speaker 2:          02:55          His cabinet

Speaker 1:          02:56          is not giving proposals, but to give so used all of this money from the United States do nationalize the big corporations, steel factories, electric companies, phone companies, even the car making them off like Renno and citron. They all had the government as their biggest shareholder, but not only that, they also created a deregister system on society where the state would play a major role in all areas, including conditions for hiring workers as well as the minimum wage. This is a really important point because not all welfare states that created the same in Germany. There was no minimum wage and there was a bigger space for trade unions and companies do negotiate contract conditions. Further, healthcare was provided by private insurance and regional governments has a lot to say when it came to the laws and regulations. Nevertheless, in France, all of the social policies came from the central authority, in other words, to go represents kind of the opposite of what we like era, visual,

Speaker 2:          03:49          holistic,

Speaker 1:          03:54          but despite all of that, during these first few years after World War Two from center to these so called glorious 30 for three decades, the average wage triples and those companies sponsored by the governments became a global leader.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Give some context. This was way before American companies started moving their factories to China. Renu initial inward opening factories in Spain where salaries were much lower, but let's be honest, during that time, every European country was growing at the same rate. Just think about it. We're talking about the 19 sixties. That was not the economic powerhouse that it is today. Latin America was full of dictatorships of all kinds, and the Soviet Union was simply unable to produce high enough quality goods to be sold in the international market. Nonetheless, France had unimportant industrial tradition. They've had a well educated society, and overall it had good rule of law and stable political system

Speaker 2:          04:49          companies.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Not only that, in 1958, so those countries already rebuilds by the Marshall Plan, decided to create a free trade union which would eventually become the European Union. At this time, if France had the largest population of these countries, and I don't forget the back in that time, Germany was still divided into two hops. All of this meant that France was in the strongest position. Do you negotiate that entry conditions? And as I said before, Charles, the goal was no fan of free trade. He used his negotiating how to make France the dominant country in certain industries such as aggregate

Speaker 2:          05:25          culture,

Speaker 1:          05:28          Europe, Europe, Europe. It doesn't help anything nor means anything. So if you are watching this video from anywhere in Europe, you might have heard about the common agricultural policy. This is a policy created to keep European consumers from buying agricultural goods from the developing world, but not only that, it also imposes production quotas inside of the European economic area. This means Polish or Spanish. Farmers cannot sell enough that they want to sell. There is a maximum quota imposed by Brussels and you can probably guess that, Oh yes, this was a French invention. It helps explain things like,

Speaker 2:          06:02          yes,

Speaker 1:          06:05          price value of 70 point 4 billion euros in 2011. French agricultural production is the leader in Europe. The goal held power for decades and the following French presidents kept this dirigiste model at the end of the day, during the 19 sixties and seventies, France was on fire, so if something works, why would you fix it? Oh, well actually now I'm going to tell you exactly why you should fix it,

Speaker 2:          06:31          st

Speaker 1:          06:33          to a different problem. The problem starts when the rest of the world is running faster than you were. Of course. Talking about the eighties and nineties, the Berlin Wall came down. China started opening up their economy and lots of new countries like Spain and Greece became members of the European. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          06:47          union,

Speaker 1:          06:49          and of course all of these countries wanted to sell their products. In other words, all of the sudden France had rifles, and this is what explains why this kind of news is quite so common, furious French farmers who have been attacking Spanish fruit and vegetable deliveries has affects of the e coli crisis, continue to bite Spanish producers of slash their prices to make up for huge losses and now up to forty cents a kilo cheaper than their French counterparts. The same happens with other industries. Take a look at this chart that represents the trade balance in France. Pay Attention. You can see how often the nineties exports on dropping slowly. This trend is especially true after the financial crisis, so maybe you under the Alcatel mobile phones, these were mobile phones that were really popular when mobile phones were just becoming a thing. Alcatel was an absolute juggernaut in this area and now they've said disappeared in a market dominated by American Chinese and South Korean companies, and this is just one example of how France is losing their ability to

Speaker 2:          07:57          innovative.

Speaker 1:          08:00          Now you might be wondering what of all the French government's done to tackle this problem? Well, really they just protected the companies from the rest of the welds. For an opposite example, let's have a look at Sweden. He makes Volvo cars where the Chinese company wanted to buy this from. The Swedish government didn't intervene at all in Sweden. There was a clear separation between business and the state, but we cannot say the same of France. Just have a look at what happens when it Pepsi wanted to buy the new moon in 2000 and

Speaker 2:          08:26          fine

Speaker 1:          08:29          barlow. The labor minister said the government will do all we can to oppose a bid and Terry Britain, the finance minister, pledge to protect Donald, but this is not the only thing that doesn't change. In France. They're social spending is still the highest in the European Union. Even larger than that of the Nordic countries and further the French administration employees, more civil sevens than any other European country and their salaries are also pretty enormous. So basically France has a lower income than they had in the past, but they keep spending like they did during the glory days. This explains why their public debt is quite as large as it is, what things they might just be on the verge of change.

Speaker 1:          09:12          Crones, quiet revolution. Alright, so politicians do you promise a lot during elections and they don't do always deliver on those promises, but there is something we have to admit. In the case of Kronk, his program is a complete break with the French dirigisme. All the political analysts have labeled this man, is it motor a politician? He wants to continue the work of his predecessors, but the big question is, is that really true? The truth is that some of his proposals, they've never even been put forward by another French presidents from any side of the political spectrum is precisely a big reform program to open up a series of services and increased competition in terms of products. And good markets, transportation on some for the better understanding in an electoral campaign that became famous because of the populous tone of Mrs [inaudible], Mr Macron is proposing to retire over 120,000 civil sevens know many of you might think that this is a pretty horrible idea, but there is something we must admit he's being on it.

Speaker 2:          10:12          Yes.

Speaker 1:          10:15          No, the politician who would suggest such an unpopular thing during an election. Nonetheless, macron has won this election by often doing the opposite of what a candidate should supposedly do. On his manifesto, he promised that he would never reduce the return and sage and other words, macron is really committed to reducing French publix

Speaker 2:          10:33          ending

Speaker 1:          10:37          on the other hands. Macron combines all of these budget cuts with lowering taxes and helping small companies in his own words. Macron wants to substitute the French dirigisme with something closer to the model of Germany or Sweden where welfare states coexist with the free market economy. So now you might be wondering, even after winning the elections, does he have any actual power to make this happen? In France? The president doesn't have as much power as the American president sends. Every lawyer wants to pass, has to go through parliaments and now the question has to be who is the biggest force in parliaments weld. That is something we're not going to know until the summer of 2017 in June. French people are going to go back to the voting stations and this time they're voting and legislative elections and it is here that the party of Marine Le Pen, the national front, has a better chance of becoming the main four. What does the French for our rights actually want? Well, if you'd like to know more about that, you should definitely check out one of our previous videos, which you can click on, right?

Speaker 2:          11:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:37          And now the question is, do you really believe in this quiet revolution of Emmanuel Macron? Do you believe that he can pull from sound of the whole? Do you think French stagnation has a solution?
