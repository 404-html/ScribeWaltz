Speaker 1:          00:02          And the reason is the exposure of the Panama papers in the paradise papers, if once again, but tax havens on the public opinion radar in the last two years, criticism of these places has multiplied all throughout the wells, politicians, businessmen, soccer players, singers, or simply investors and savers. Many people transfer part of their fortunes to these places supposedly to pay fewer taxes. That's why many critics states that if it weren't for these millionaire paradise, the 2008 financial crisis would have been less of a crisis. We're told that without these paradises, governments wouldn't have to make so many cuts with all pay fewer taxes, and ultimately it would make things much better. Well, the question now is how true is all of this? All tax havens rarely so bad for the general welfare of the population? Well, let's check it out.

Speaker 1:          01:00          The first thing we need to be clear about is what a tax haven is. A tax haven is nothing more than a jurisdiction with low taxes, high legal security, and an extreme amounts of protection of the savers privacy. This is very important because cutting taxes isn't enough to turn a territory into a tax haven, not at all. You see, the international investors and savers who use these jurisdictions really want to protect their assets. That's why they not only demands low taxes, but also legal security that is in addition to low taxes. They want to ensure that their assets are safe from any kinds of robbery, nationalization confiscation, corruption, inflation, etc. Therefore, what's common to all tax havens even more than low taxes isn't legal safety. They're all the cayman islands, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, cypress, jersey, ends, bermuda. All of these jurisdictions that we recognize as important financial centers in that characterized by their high legal safety say this, essentially know that the government's not going to take all of their money. It's precisely this combination of low taxes and high legal security that makes these territories receive so much capital from around the world and to grow at rates and much higher than in other countries and though operating in these places isn't illegal in itself, despite what the media might suggest appearing in the paradise papers are in the Panama papers. It doesn't necessarily mean that you've committed a crime. In fact, most of the names on these lists of those entirely innocent people,

Speaker 1:          02:35          people like alex krivaline, shakira, whose assets have a legal origin and to use tax havens to minimize their tax bills within the bounds of the law. This may seem more or less immoral, but it's perfectly legal. Another very important detail which we usually forget is that these tax havens are a refuge for millions of citizens. You have the misfortune of being in authoritarian and extractive country. we all know that there are many countries in the world where the most basic human rights on guarantees or wow authoritarian governments arbitrarily decide who to repress or persecuted that is. Many investors don't seek protection just for lower taxes. They also escaping political, ideological, and religious. I think for example, of political dissidence in Russia or Venezuela or families who are threatened by kidnapping in Mexico or entrepreneurs that come from countries with few guarantees like Zimbabwe or better reduce, well, they all benefit from being able to access jurisdictions that guarantee the safety, that tax havens

Speaker 1:          03:44          because it's also a matter of justice. And then we do explain it, most people think it's an aberration, when some states present messages and it's from leaving the country as happens with the berlin wall, what we should also probably think it's an aberration when states preventing their citizens from taking their savings out of the country and depositing it in a more protective foreign jurisdiction. That is of course, if they're doing it in compliance with the law. In any case, the truth is that both the media and politicians greatly exaggerate the Consequences that these tax havens half on our economies. So let's check it out. A very exaggerated

Speaker 2:          04:24          roll.

Speaker 1:          04:26          Too many polIticians and journalists tax havens are greatly responsible for all of the ells we suffer, such as the third world governments budget cuts, inequality, and under development. ThiS is what the organization, oxfam argues. For example, I check this out. The current global inequality crisis has a clear ally in tax havens. These jurisdictions represent the black hole through the development opportunities, uh, millions of people around the world fall. Well, first of all, we must state that oxfam is definition of a tax. Haven is a bit lax in their opinion. A tax haven is any country that has very low taxes, especially for foreign investments. This definition includes countries like the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which of course they received such a qualification from the european commission, the european parliament, or the oec deep, but all right, even with this definition, let's see how important those tax havens really off.

Speaker 1:          05:23          Say, let's take the case of Spain, a european union country with a high average income that has many economic problems as well as high taxes. Well, based on their government's own data, Spain invested 40 point nine, $1, billion euros overseas in 2016 of this total. Nine point five, 4 billion ended up in what? Oxfam mccall's tax havens. Nine point five, $4 million is less than five percent of everything. Spanish people invested in the entire world, including Spain during that year. So really the reality is that the relevance of these tax savings isn't quite as great as it's made out to be. In fact, the highest place the world heritage of tax havens at about seven point $6,000,000,000,000. And that might seem like a huge number, but when you look at it from a global perspective, it's actually quite small, so we might not like it, but the truth is that tax havens can hardly be responsible for the big problems that many critics say they are. But that's not all here. Let's return to Spain situation. 80 seven percent of the spanish investments that went to oxfam's tax havens in 2016 were concentrated in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. We're talking about a bit over $8,000,000 out. Well, in that same year, these three countries invested over $12,000,000,000 into Spain. As you can see, tax havens not only do two d capitalize, the business fabric of a country is fiscally uncompetitive as Spain. In fact, it's quite the opposite. These tax havens of helped capitalize the week spanish economy.

Speaker 3:          06:50          Luxembourg is the country that invest the most in Spain, in factorieS, buildings, farms, employment, but it isn't public, but private money most comes from companies and savings vehicles established in the country. Javier, gee, your in economics journalist in it'll competency are. But Having said that, let's look at another key question. How much revenue did governments lose

Speaker 1:          07:13          result of tax havens? Is it true that without them there would have been no cuts during the crisis? Well, let's see.

Speaker 3:          07:26          Story of the milKmaid.

Speaker 1:          07:30          We've seen one of the most common criticisms tax havens yet is that if we hadn't had such unfair competition, governments wouldn't have had to make budget cuts as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. But is it true? Well, let's get baCk to our spanish case again. As you know, this is one of the countries that suffered the most from the recession. Well, according to data from the spanish ministry of economy, the investment accumulated in oxfam defined tax savings year after year announced an $80 million dollars. Well, if all of that money had been accumulated in Spain, instead of tax havens, the extra income that the spanish state would have received would have been approximately one to one point 5 billion euros. Again, it sounds like quite a bit of money, but I promise you it's a really minuscule amount in the overall scheme of

Speaker 4:          08:13          thanks.

Speaker 1:          08:16          Give you an idea about that. It's about zero point one percent of the spanish gdp and less than point five percent of all taxes collected. In other words, it has a very limited impact and if instead of Spain we took a look at what's happening in the rest of the world, the situation is pretty similar. In fact, even if we take the highest estimates of the tax Justice network, which is the source that's usually used to denounce tax havens, we'll see. They show a global collection loss of about $200,000,000,000, which is Barely one percent of all the tax revenues of the world's governments. No. The truth is that contrary to what's usually claimed, a tax havens aren't to be blamed for the cuts, nor do they force us to pay more taxes or really harm our economies. We mAy not like it much, but it's just the thing.

Speaker 4:          09:01          No.

Speaker 1:          09:06          In 1980 islands was actually poor than Spain today. Thanks to these policies, that's the second richest country in the eurozone. To improve the general welfare, we need more companies, not more politicians and not more public spending. The problems that countries with economic difficulties face don't usually come from tax havens, ms from the politicians, but now is your time. Do you think that tax havens should be persecuted?
