Speaker 1:          00:07          Brazil is the country of the future, but it seems like we've been hearing that for a long time lately though. We've had a lots of other countries, corruption scandals, the economic crisis this is going through or the street violence in cities like Rio de Janeiro bond. There is something even more important about this country. Something that doesn't appear very much in the media.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27          Brazil is the most expensive country in all of South America. Yep. You heard that, right? If you go shopping in a city like Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, you'd better be ready to clean out your wallet because it will be as expensive as New York or London. The Brazilians even have a name for this. They call it customer Brazil. This is the special charge you have to pay for living in the country of Samba. So let's look at an example. The Big Mac Burger that you buy from Mcdonald's. If you've been subscribed to visual politics for a long time, you already know that the economists use something called the Big Mac index to measure the cost of living in a country double in Switzerland. One of the wealthiest countries in the world, the big Mac costs a whopping six point seven, $5. Then we have Peru, a poorer country where the Burger and costs $3 and twenty three cents. Fair enough, right? Well, in Brazil, the big Mac, it costs $5 and ten cents. It's more expensive than in Denmark, the UK or Canada, according to the ex parte astound.com website. Sao Paulo is the most expensive city in South America with prices as high as Houston, Texas, Berlin, or Germany.

Speaker 1:          01:39          And now you might want to give them the high cost of living. How high a Brazilian salaries, all the wealthier save and Colombians. Chileans. Well, absolutely not. The average wage in Brazil is less than $600 a month. Argentinians and Chileans are actually better off in this regard. So the real question here is why is Brazil so expensive? One of the reasons why a middle income country has the prices of a wealthy one. Well, today we are going to answer this question and believe me, there's also partly explains the Brazilian crisis too. So let's dive in. Isolated economy. Many of you might think of Brazil as a country opens a free trade, right? Well, at the end of the date, many foreign companies like mastercard or Barclays have a strong presence in this country. Nonetheless, Brazil has the highest tariffs in South America. So what does this mean? Well, imagine we have a cell phone manufacturer in America or in, they wanted to sell on the Brazilian market. Since our product is made abroad, we must sell it with a special tax that could reach up to 35 percent of its market price. As you can imagine, this type of policy has a pretty big impact on everyday life.

Speaker 2:          02:55          Contento

Speaker 1:          02:55          exits. Brazilian market due to high tariffs. Yes. Heard that right. During those years, Brazilians, he wanted to buy a we or an intended des had to travel to Uruguay in order to find one. Interestingly, this was a great advantage for Nintendo's biggest rivals, especially Microsoft and the Xbox, and you know why? Well, Microsoft has a factory in Brazil where the xbox one is made. This means they don't have to import it and therefore it doesn't have those high tariffs and yes, I know what you're thinking. High tariffs are cool because they forced companies to build factories in your country and employ your citizens. Right? Well, think twice that when Microsoft opens that Brazilian factory, they still need to import all the machines and materials needed to manufacture that xbox one. This can be plastic semiconductors, robots. Many of these things are made somewhere else and if they are made somewhere else, they still have these special tariffs and you can guess who pays for these extra costs. Of course, it's the consumer. This explains why so many products manufactured in Brazil, also expensive. Want an example? Take the Volkswagen Golf in Mexico City. This car costs around 15,000 US dollars

Speaker 1:          04:13          in Sao Paulo. It costs 25,000 US dollars. All of this, despite the fact that this specific model of automobile is many factored in Sao Paulo, but wait a minute because this is not the only thing that explains this. Customer Brazil or what the Brazilians used to refer to this incredibly high cost of living cousteau. Let's imagine someone doing soy agriculture in the state of power in the north of this country. If he wants to send this side is all power, he must carry it on trucks through the highway, be all one six, three. This highway has over a thousand kilometers and a hundred of its on. Not even paved. A simple rainy day is enough to keep those trucks stuck in the mud, and this is just one example. In fact in Brazil has some of the worst infrastructure in the world.

Speaker 1:          05:00          Even India has better roads, so to make a comparison, any xymogen American farmer sells $100 in, so he has to spend $9 on transportation. The same farmer in Brazil, I'd have to pay $25 since they have no good roads. Brazilians have to invest in expensive trucks that break down quickly and make the cost even more expensive. And of course all of this means higher and higher prices for Brazilian customers. But now you might be wondering, well, why is the Brazilian governments are reluctant to pay for infrastructure? But at the end of the day, Brazil has state of the art engineering companies, companies like the automatic.

Speaker 2:          05:34          It's great.

Speaker 1:          05:40          He happened to be someone watching from a South American country. Well, this name probably rings a bell for you or direct was the biggest engineering and construction company in the region, and I do say was here because they had the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the continent and as naturally with the future of the firm isn't looking pretty dim. But this story does explain well why Brazil has such poor infrastructure because at the end of the day, part of the money goes towards bribes and corruption. But normally that's when the Brazilian government wanted to modernize their country world. What did they do?

Speaker 3:          06:15          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:16          well, they decided to host the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup. So today, Brazilian cities can congratulate themselves for having the most beautiful sports arenas with high end technology and luxurious decoration today, taking a walk in the center of Sao Paolo, or it feels like being in a Scifi movie, but outside of this metropolis, the railroads or abandons the highways are unpaved and several neighborhoods don't have a single bus line that connects them with the city center. Woeful infrastructure costs the economy as much as $48, billion US dollars per year. Now, of course this affects the prices for Brazilian consumers, but also for worldwide consumers who wants to buy and Brazilian goods. But that is something we're actually going to address in a future video because now the question really becomes how can someone who makes $600 bucks a month spend 25 bucks on pizza as an average restaurant in Sao Paolo? Well, I am going to tell you how

Speaker 2:          07:13          ready

Speaker 1:          07:14          the hallway for decades, Brazil had some of the highest inflation in the wells during the 19 eighties and nineties, they had more than 6,000 percent inflation. This means if you had a bear as a Rio de Janeiro bar in 1980, you would pay 100 femoral. The terra was the Brazilian currency back. Then one year later, that same beer would cost 600,000 arrows. As you can imagine, hyperinflation created unique consumer behavior

Speaker 2:          07:44          behavior

Speaker 1:          07:44          that was quite different from the rest of the world in order to survive. Resilience, ships got used to selling with installments and it's. This is still a thing today. If you go to any Brazilian shop, you can see that next to the prices said something like 10 x, 12 x or 20 x. This number means that you can pay for this product on 10, 12 or 20 installments.

Speaker 2:          08:08          In other words,

Speaker 1:          08:09          question many Brazilians ask themselves is not whether this TV, your this suit is more or less expensive, but if they can pay for it during the next two years, and as you can imagine when you buy something in installments, it is far more extensive. On the screen, we're showing you a smartphone on a Brazilian ecommerce website. If you bought a ones, it costs 632 you race, which is equivalent to $202 at the moment. We need this video nonetheless. If you buy it with installments, it costs 217 US dollars, which is a seven percent increase. So as you can imagine, your average Brazilian is in debt all the time. Ninety percent of Brazilians in installment

Speaker 2:          08:51          debt, but

Speaker 1:          08:54          wait just a minute because is not the

Speaker 2:          08:55          worst of it. In the last year, something has happened in Brazil that is done to custody Brazil into a real nice matt ready

Speaker 1:          09:04          card. How at the beginning of the two thousands, Brazil, it was the perfect market for foreign banks. Big Financial firms like Santander or credit suisse started investing in the country. And don't forget, we're talking about a $200 million person country that was on the rise here where prices were high and people are used to paying for things in installments and other words. Brazil. It was a paradise for selling credit cards since 2005 Brazil's credit card market has grown at a 20 percent plus rate and yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:38          Yep,

Speaker 1:          09:39          yeah, 2012 Brazilians had an average of two credit cards per person and they really knew how to use them. Brazil was the country with the most credit payments across all of South America. Nonetheless, that happiness, it didn't last very super default and credit cards has reached 27 percent in April 2012 in the very same year, 2012, the alarm started to sound in all those Brazilian banks. The country was in the middle of a crisis with rising unemployment and declining salaries and that made it hard for Brazilians. Do pay back that debt. So what happens when a bank is afraid of getting into falses? Well, as the interest,

Speaker 2:          10:16          great

Speaker 1:          10:19          residents have to pay 414 percent interest on their credit cards. So you mentioned you use your credit card to buy a TV screen. The costs you a thousand US dollars, you pay for it in 12 installments. Well, at the end of the day, counting the interest rates and the credit card, the TV costs around 5,000 US dollars. Pretty impressive, isn't it? And don't forget that the average wage in present is less than $600 a month. In other words, no matter the antipoverty measures taken by the government, most Brazilians struggling to survive and west of all, since they call it, saves money, losing a job and be a real tragedy for many,

Speaker 2:          10:55          almost

Speaker 1:          10:56          relation in Rio de Janeiro increases 150 percent in three years.

Speaker 2:          10:59          Yes.

Speaker 1:          11:03          Yeah. Is the question now, can Brazil get over the situation? Who could possibly reformed this country?
