Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:09          China has started in what has been the greatest economic revolution in the history of mankind. However, in spite of this in 2017 both Moody's and standard and Poor's, two of the three main rating agencies reduced the Chinese debt rating. Brits pause. The International Monetary Fund itself has been issuing warnings about this for months. Yet the Chinese economy is growing strongly, but that does not mean everything is going well. In fact, not at all. In recent years as we've already discussed in a video that are linked to you at the end, China's economy has seen one parameter saw exponentially and that's corporate debt and this isn't small news. Chinese corporate debt accounts for almost 170% of China's GDP. To give you an idea of what this means, we could say that this 170% GDP level is one of the highest on the planet and is a, for example, twice that of the United States. Some of you might be wondering, well, if the Chinese economy seems to be doing so well, how did its companies accumulate such a huge debt? Well, the truth is that in recent years, Chinese companies have gone on a sort of spending spree. You all over the world, they've bought everything foreign companies, ports, airports, minds, railways, even soccer teams,

Speaker 1:          01:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:48          knees invasion seemed unstoppable. And then that's precisely what caused to so many countries do develop an aggressive discourse against this kind of occupation. And not only that, as the Chinese have begun investing in the poorest countries in Africa, many analysts, journalists and activists have accused Beijing of practicing this sort of colonialism.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Do

Speaker 2:          02:13          beware, because this phenomenon is really quite widespread. Companies, investors, entrepreneurs, government institutions, it does not matter. In recent years, the obsession to get money out of China has been shared practically the only every person in the Chinese economy now. So all these, some of the might now be thinking, well, Chinese people buying all kinds of things are important over the world. People in Beijing, they've got to be rubbing their hands together. Right? Well, the truth is that no, actually nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, throughout the last year, Xi Jinping's government has launched many measures to stop this process. Oh, well, I'm just a moment. And the Beijing government actually wants to stop this Chinese purchase wave. I mean, protecting, they're wanting to take over the world. Well, it's not that they don't want to, but they certainly do have their reasons for this. So listen up.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Other face of Chinese investment we mentioned we want to invest abroad. As you can imagine, we can do it in many different ways. For example, we can buy debt from a foreign government, from a foreign company, from a foreign bank. We can also buy shares in another country, stock markets, but we can also carry out what is known as foreign direct investment that is by a local company, opened a store, a factory, oh workshop, et Cetera, et cetera. In other words, invest in a real asset in field.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Oh,

Speaker 2:          03:42          we gotta sneak a direct foreign investment implies a greater degree of complexity, certainly greater risk, which is why it's expected to generate greater profitability. Of course, if it wants, there would be no incentive to implement them. After all, it's infinitely easier to buy financial assets while sitting in front of a computer at the office, or even just in your pajamas hunting them. Well, the fact is that paradoxically is this type of investment has grown in recent years. It's profitability has actually plummeted according to China's stinked currency administration. The rate of return, this type of investments profitability dropped to barely 0.4% in 2016 oh. Despite the fact that almost every stock market was skyrocketing. Therefore, in spite of the colonial isn't accusations. The truth is that many of the Chinese investment projects off working so badly, but that more of a headache than a business of the century.

Speaker 1:          04:40          No.

Speaker 2:          04:41          Before you might be thinking, well, hold off a minute, Simon, I mean, what exactly is the problem here? Is it simply that that dress making too little money? Well, according to what we learned about corporate desk, yeah, it is a large part of this huge international expansion was financed with debt data. That, of course must be repaid with interest. And if the investments fail or don't generate the expected returns, it could create a huge solvency problem, which would obviously seriously affect the Chinese financial system, which belongs fundamentally to the government. Take for example, v Signer Hydro and China Railway Engineering Corporation, case to engineering and construction companies owned by the Chinese government. You see, in 2007 they reached a huge agreements with the Congolese government in exchange for a concession to exploit copper. Are they committed to investing $9 billion in the African country, 3 billion in the mine, and 6 billion in infrastructure to government owned companies that had nothing to do with mining and we're entirely financed by a Chinese government owned.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Thank you. These

Speaker 2:          05:53          Chinese companies have already invested more than $2 billion and so far everything's been a problem. The price of copper fell. The reserves went as big as expected. The logistical costs were really high because they hadn't even guaranteed that power supply. And of course all of this man's many costs and many, many delays. Only nine years later in 2016 were they able to start extracting copper in much lower quantities and then extract it? So whatever the future holds. The reality is that during the last decades, this agreements was a big headache, is a great sauce of losses. And don't think that this project was an exception. The truth is that in recent years, Chinese companies government owns, and it's private companies alike, I've gotten into serious debt, buying all kinds of assets without caring about the price.

Speaker 2:          06:42          That is not all. In addition, all these investments, I mean capital leaving the country at such a high rate, the between 2011 and the beginning of 2017 Chinese currency reserves plummeted by $1 trillion. And that my friends is a lot of money. And it's something that goes in the opposite direction of what Beijing one switch in recent years trying to strengthen the yuan. So now we come to the question of why are Chinese investors suit eager to get money out of the country? Why do they seem so surprisingly bad when it comes to investing abroad? Well, listen up.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Yep.

Speaker 2:          07:21          Bad incentive.

Speaker 1:          07:24          Sorry.

Speaker 2:          07:25          So the fact that Chinese investors seems so in competent when it comes to investing abroad is a matter of incentives and to be a rocker a, see the main priority for the Chinese who managed to make money is to transfer part of birth, their assets abroad. So why is this? Well, it's fundamentally a matter of legal.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Hello

Speaker 2:          07:45          me to explain. As you know, China is a dictatorship and that means that if tomorrow you have a problem with the political power, your money could just disappear. And not only that, as in any dictatorship, there are many restrictions because if things go wrong, what could be better? And having part of your patron any protected in other countries, it seems pretty sensible rights. I think most people would do it. I mean,

Speaker 1:          08:11          yeah. Well that's

Speaker 2:          08:13          one of the explanations for why so many Chinese businessmen wanted to invest their money as quickly as possible, even if it meant paying a premium may sort of surcharge. But that isn't the only reason. Additionally, in recent years since 2008 the Chinese government promoted easy and cheap credit has a mechanism to boost the economy and of course when you can get into death under such favorable conditions, you wouldn't be as demanding when selecting which projects to invest in. Yes, this is one of the big problems with expansive monetary policies. They encourage bad investments that later aren't really difficult to pay off, but hold on a moment. The entity is most responsible for the huge slab of corporate dads to this. We've talked about have not been private companies. That's actually one's owned by the state. And this though surprising also has a lot to do with incentives. See investing outside of the country in large amounts men's cause that managers could puff up their chests before the Beijing government view to the growth that that companies had achieved. On the other hand, it meant many of these managers cause can move on. So you ran another country and charged a lot of money. Let's say that their interests are different from those of their company.

Speaker 2:          09:37          Of course if business was done in countries as complicated as Africa, it was also easier to take a slice gets a commission, shall we say. In addition, Chinese state owned companies have huge bureaucratic structures which makes decision making and adapting to any changes that may occur very, very slow. Yup. State owned companies tends to be much more inefficient. While that's what's CG Peng wants to face up to while trying to consolidate his power. Dangerous Game [inaudible] this huge shopping mal strum, which is often done without too much thought also happens in Japan in the 1980s that is before the Greek crisis of the early nineties and in Beijing. They're terrified that something similar will happen to them. So what do you think they did well, the introduced a lot of restrictions on foreign investments in such a way that now the Chinese government can veto corporate operations abroad for Chinese companies even if they are carried out by private companies.

Speaker 1:          10:40          Yes,

Speaker 2:          10:42          this has a double intention because in addition to cooling the foreign investment process, it also strongly reinforces Xi Jinping's political power. Let's see that with this excuse the Chinese government has taken and enormous mechanism out of its sleeve to reward friends and to punish the less loyal. In addition with the excuse of increasing control, Beijing is also promoting the merging of government owned companies, which until now works autonomously to create huge corporations and this gives Beijing even more power. Of course, all these actions can weigh on the growth of Chinese companies. They can decrease competition and increase the bureaucracy in efficiency with which the Chinese public sector operates. But yes, Xi Jingping we'll get even more power.

Speaker 2:          11:30          China has many strengths but this is one of its great weaknesses. Even so Chinese savings are so high that it seems difficult to reproduce a financial crisis like the one the Japan experienced, but the risk certainly does exist. That was your turn.
