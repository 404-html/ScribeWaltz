Speaker 1:          00:00          Have you ever wondered how a country can be hijacked, how institutions can be subjective, averted and corrupted and perhaps most importantly, how do you identify the moments in which a democracy after being taken over stops working? Their view of those questions have pervaded global politics, butts especially they've pervaded Latin American politics.

Speaker 2:          00:19          I can do that here on my needs. He has been put in my name [inaudible] and peanut butter on it.

Speaker 3:          00:44          Yeah. Put me at Moz. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Last few decades, numerous last and American leaders of taking control of their countries. Sometimes they did it through Kuda Taz, but in many other occasions these dictators came to power through democratic means. That is precisely the case of Nicaraguan President Daniel or Tayga.

Speaker 3:          01:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Visual policy. We've already told you about this political figure, how he came to power, how he behaved and how he was responsible for the huge strikes that Nicaragua has been going through in 2018

Speaker 3:          01:24          yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Strikes that have been answered with a heavy hands and which have led to terrible consequences. More than 200 people have lost their lives. Hundreds have been detained. Thousands have been injured. Well, in this video, we're going to take a look at another aspect of the events. Yes. This is the story of how a government's managed to take control of the state and make the institutions work, not for the country, but for itself. This is the story of how I kinds of political Matthia took control of Nicaragua, so listen up.

Speaker 3:          02:09          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:11          yeah. It's 2006 and Daniel Ortega winds the Nicaraguan presidential elections after 16 years as the opposition, the Sandinista leader returns to the country, his presidency, the precedents, what exactly good. His first time as president between 1985 and 1990 was frankly terrible. I'll tell you, go left and economically and socially. It shattered country. It was a company that went through a warm ended up with a foreign debt six times bigger than its GDP and suffered from hyperinflation that are reached the astronomical figure of 33.547% by 1987 to give you an idea of the magnitude of this disaster, in 1990 the per capita income of Nicaragua was 55% smaller than the country he had registered back in 1978 in other words, compared to Daniel Ortega, even the kushners would get good grades. Ortega's economic model. It was a huge failure. The expropriations, the gigantic foreign debt, the unstoppable money printing and his obsession with controlling the economy led Nicaragua into an unsustainable situation. Hands, I mean, how wouldn't it of with that recipe, we has the conscious conflict to all of this financed by the United States. The country was submerged in a complete disaster.

Speaker 3:          03:53          Bye,

Speaker 1:          03:54          right? For those of you who don't know, the contracts were paramilitary groups financed by Washington through selling weapons to Iran. When this country was in the middle of a walk with Iraq, a country that was supposedly close to Washington in shorts, lots of nonsense. So throughout the following decades, the country only out of one initiative that was simply to recover from this hideous mess.

Speaker 3:          04:16          See

Speaker 1:          04:28          this, the following government, starting with that a violator tomorrow, by the way, the first elected female Latin American president decided to turn the country's political and economic approach right around that is to move from a centralized economy, which was organized and directed by the state to a market.

Speaker 3:          04:50          Got It.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Salvey Nicaragua and free trade zones were born now as well as the policies do attract foreign investments, which along with international cooperation and especially the growing remittances from abroad allowed to Nicaragua to get back on track. Hold on just a moment because what these new governments didn't achieve was putting an end to corruption. Thus scandal after scans all the feeling of frustration, disappointment, and deceit that all Nicaraguans fells along with an opposition who was willing to do almost anything to return to power fueled Ortega's victory in 2006 here few s is where the new story begins, especially because all Tayga wasn't going to waste as returned to power. This was his charms. This was his to dominate in Nicaragua, in politics, finances and society, but to achieve this and above all to prevent an electoral process from Maria evicting him from the presidency. He needed to seize political power with an armed force and an economic monopoly. This as the strategy he set in motion and the steps he took to achieve his purpose, sort of listening,

Speaker 3:          06:24          political power,

Speaker 1:          06:28          obviously his strategy, his first goal was to achieve political hegemony and social control by any means necessary. This was very clear to Ortega from the beginning and he launched a double tactic to achieve it fast by invading the institutions and centralizing power and then my limiting and intimidating the opposition, something for which fear is usually a very, very effective ingredients. Shortly after arriving Ortega launch day paramilitary force composed of gang members. We're talking about shock and groups better known in Nicaragua as the toddlers.

Speaker 4:          07:02          They are feared and the people call them mobs. They usually wear tee shirts that speak of love and peace wear helmets to hide their faces and move on motorcycles. They're mostly very violent young people. [inaudible] journalists in Managua.

Speaker 1:          07:18          It's objective. Well, I would be too intimidated to the political opposition to frighten those who disagree with the government and to try and dismantle the opposition's demonstrations or concentrations with violence. Obviously it isn't an official forests, but they have the government's protection and we're going to see how that works in just a moment.

Speaker 4:          07:38          Say that a para military force has been set up in Nicaragua that is composed of gang members, but sometimes we get on a bus and a para military member is watching us [inaudible] Castillo, Nicaraguan activist,

Speaker 1:          07:49          but of course it doesn't end here. The next step to achieve total political control is to take control of the state institutions as well. How do you think he did that?

Speaker 3:          08:06          Well

Speaker 1:          08:07          first political decentralization to be ended, in this case, municipal autonomy thus in Nicaragua or Tayga is political henchmen has managed to dismiss mayors at will. Something like, Hey, if you've got a political arrive, I'll just kick him out of the race. That way you don't need to get rid of your opponents. You also win loyal fans who of course don't want to risk making him out. Right? The second step to institutional takeover was do create ans or legitimize his own political organizations. In this case, the citizen power councils, these bodies which supposedly involved community participation in practice have the objective of creating a parallel political structure that is recognized and controlled by the government.

Speaker 3:          08:54          I'm the feds

Speaker 1:          08:55          appoints

Speaker 3:          08:56          and achieve the indefinite permanence of his party associates in every key state position. The electoral power, the judicial power ends, the general control that and different official protests. I mean that's what those moms is a four right? So how about two examples of proving what Ortega achieved with this strategy? Well, check this out.

Speaker 1:          09:22          One ends. The Nicaraguan Constitution prohibited the consecutive reelection of the president, so I'll tell you go would've completed his turn and 2001

Speaker 3:          09:29          11

Speaker 1:          09:32          as Hernandez did in on drs or Tayga and managed to get to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, composed mostly of Sandinista magistrates stupid declared article one four seven as in applicable, which is the one that prevented the presidential consecutive reelection in exchange. Yup. Theme Magistrates positions were insured for life. Quite the exchange. On the other hand, in 2011 fraud suspicions were so intense that both the European Union and the Organization of American States concluded that they weren't sure if the results, you know, you controlled the electoral power. Yes it would be, or tag or, and he made sure that his followers could do and undo whatever they wanted. In fact, in the following elections, the 2016 ones, they didn't even split and the ruling party took full control of the process. But hold on a moment. You might be thinking, I mean it wasn't there a big scandal because of the Simon. Well, let's say that the president had made sure that practically every major media station in the country, it was controlled by his family of their associates.

Speaker 3:          10:38          You're taking

Speaker 1:          10:38          a family monopolizes the media in Nicaragua mobs and the occupation of institutions and the media, well, this is the political side, but this much more the force monopoly as cool as much as he holds political power. If a dictator, it doesn't hold the military force, he's taking a huge risk. This was very clear to our protagonists. Say these seconds. Pillar of this strategy was to take over the police and to take over the army. Did he say he took advantage of his majority in the National Assembly as soon as he got into power or take your push to reform that place, the ability to appoint new faculties of the National Police and the army of the republic in his hands. Then taking advantage of these new possibilities. He placed relatives and loyal people [inaudible] in charge of these institutions. For example, the police aren't directed by his own father in law Francisco Diaz. This means you can get the police to look the other way. When the mob, Zach, since when the opposition strikes, repression, repression, well more repression because when the mafia holds the power, it's not easy for them to let go. Well, we've covered politics and we've covered force, but there's still a third element missing

Speaker 1:          12:05          economic power.

Speaker 3:          12:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:09          Pillar in the strategy was to achieve economic power for three reasons. First to prevent in Nicaragua and capital from supporting an alternative seconds to get resources with which to carry out Ortega's plans and third, perhaps the most important points to fill his pockets, less time. It corruption has been brutal to such an extent that the Ortega Morello family a million as see, they've taken over the media, they hold high positions in the states. They've even taken over oil important distributions in Nicaragua. They put themselves in charge of the investments, promotion agencies with a plan that we could describe like this, wanting to invest in Nicaragua. Great. We'll make it happen, but you have to give me, I can mention, you know for the country, they've also reached agreements with businessmen apparently by getting loyalty and envelopes in exchange for privileges. Your example, all of this way of doing things was the agreements made. She builds the interracial Yannick canal, seemingly unsuccessful projects in which the government reached an under the table agreement with [inaudible], the Chinese developer working on it. First thea state kept half of the profits since then with a last minute change it became 1%

Speaker 3:          13:24          it's

Speaker 1:          13:26          we as Lenny, the businessmen did some last minute haggling in short their viewer. The factors that with political power, with brute force and with economic power. Daniel Ortega became the owner and Lord of Nicaragua and also a billionaire and just in case in the last election in 2016 he presented Rosario Marillo. His wife has vice presidents, so everything certainly stays in the family

Speaker 3:          13:50          late.

Speaker 1:          13:55          This is essentially the same thing that happens in Venezuela. It is so to speak, the manual for a dictator. And the question we can ask ourselves now is can we really pretends that Nicaragua or is still a democracy? Well, leave your opinion in the comment section below.
