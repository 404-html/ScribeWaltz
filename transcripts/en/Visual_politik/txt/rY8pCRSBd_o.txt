Speaker 1:          00:07          Francis, probably the only country that makes the Americans look humble. The Ego of the French is so colossal that it doesn't even fit within its own country's borders, which explains why the French spends the 19th century colonizing other countries. Almost half of Africa was a French colony as I bet you could probably guess now. The most widely spoken language in Subsaharan Africa. Yep. That would be French, but not only that, you will probably heard that Latin America is the United States, his back yard rice. Well, we could say the Africa is kind of like the backyard of the French.

Speaker 2:          00:43          For example, in 2011, France led every military operation against Gaddafi. Francois Salons, government sent troops to defend the president of the Central African Republic. While at the same time, French soldiers were also fighting Islamic terrorists in Mali. Basically, the French army has been present in virtually every African armed conflict

Speaker 1:          01:07          prompts even actually controls the currency that many African countries use. In other words, even though African countries gained independence from from decades ago, it still maintains a strong influence on their governments. You can call it soft power, you can call it diplomacy. Oh, you could simply call it colonialism. Two point nine, and I probably know what many of you are thinking right now. France has got to be getting rich off. It's two point. Oh, African colonies, right? Well actually nothing could be further from the truth.

Speaker 3:          01:38          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:42          The last 10 years, for instance, trade with Africa has dropped from 10 to four point seven percent

Speaker 1:          01:47          had that right. Even though from dominates African politics, its economy is an entirely different story. In fact, often centuries of colonialism and neocolonialism African countries have barely evolved. Hardly any new companies have emerged due to French investments and meanwhile francis spending billions of euros every year to maintain its influence over the continent even though ultimately it barely gets any benefit at all. Bus. I, as you can guess who's reaping all of the benefits from this collaboration with Africa? Yep, of course. We will be talking about China.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Companies and Africa need each other like never before.

Speaker 1:          02:31          For the last 10 years, Chinese investment has changed the skyline of almost all African cities. Some countries like Ethiopia, at becoming industrial powers, especially in the textile sac, sac, Chinese companies aren't only taking advantage of the cheap labor, they've also found a new market to sell that product to. Chinese mobiles are sweeping across Africa and is more and more people are learning Chinese. In other words, while France sends soldiers, China sends businessmen and it looks like it's actually working out pretty well for them. So the question remains, why is France failed to capitalize on its influence in Africa and what can the new French President Emmanuel macron do to improve the situation today? Well, we're going to answer this question, but before we do, let's take a look at the history.

Speaker 2:          03:21          Disadvantages of paternalism.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Those of you who've been following visual politic for awhile know that after World War Two, every African country became independent from its colonizers. Make no mistake, not every colonizer behave the same way. For example, Spain had two colonies in Africa, Sahara and Equatorial Guinea. So when these new countries decided to become independent, the Spanish government's reaction was pretty much weight. We have colonies in Africa and then they pretty much just let them go because they had enough to worry about back home. Something similar happens with they invaded Ethiopia during miscellaneous time and weren't in a position to resist any decolonization. However, from sue was very different, so at that time the French president was this guy, Charles, to goal to goal was how can we define it? He was kind of Donald Trump, but a little bit more politically smart.

Speaker 2:          04:24          CanNot Be France without its greatness. Charleston

Speaker 3:          04:26          cool.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Now on the one hand, Charles de Gaulle had pretty much no choice but to allow its African colonies to become independence. Maintaining colonies is really expensive and from Santa focus on rebuilding itself, but as you can imagine, a government with so much ego wasn't going to give up. It's old possessions from skeptics. Ami in all of its former colonies. Sands from the Elysee Palace decided to support everyone of the political elites that had begun governing these new African countries. For example, in 1964, the French army, it's supported acu in Gabon. Since then, the country was governed by Oma bongos. Dictatorship. For more than 40 years and you supplied all the weapons, well of course it would be France and resigned and gambling and follows French foreign policy to the and is its main uranium supplier. As you probably know, France is one of the countries with the most nuclear power plants in the whole world. Well, the Uranian they use it comes almost entirely from gambling and of course they get it at a favorable price.

Speaker 2:          05:35          Gabon was out. France is like a car without a driver. France without Gabon is like a car with no fuel, well more Bunco, president of Gabon for 42 years

Speaker 1:          05:45          and the same goes for other countries such as the Ivory Coast who's president was also placed by France in 2011. The previous presidents left the palace under cannon shots and guests. He was pulling the trigger of those canons. Well, yes, it would be French soldiers and resigned. The Ivory Coast is Francis made coffee and cocoa supplier. French influence in the region is so complete. There's even the currency they use is controlled by froms,

Speaker 2:          06:08          so called CFA franc is the currency being used in 15 of west African countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast, and it turns out that the central bank that issues this currency is required to keep at least half of its foreign currency reserves in the French treasury and since its creation, the CFA franc has been linked to the French currency. He used to be the French franc and now it's the euro. This means that when the euro rises or falls, the CFA franc follow.

Speaker 1:          06:42          Wait a moment because there's some fine print here and now find brands is the productive economy. In other words, France has been running, it's former colonies policies for decades, but these countries have remained just as poor as when they were independence with the exception of the Ivory Coast. The French influenced countries in Africa tend to have underdeveloped agricultural and virtually stagnant economies. No French company has bothered to open factories in Africa and the money that came from the Elisa was invested in weapons or extracting natural resources after all who wants to do business in Africa? Well, you probably already know the answer to that. China, Africa, we've told you a thousand times. Aaron Fisher, politic. China is Africa's main trading. These China grew economically like there's no tomorrow and when one starts grabbing one needs resources. So far, nothing new because unlike France or many other Western power, China realize that Africa was more than mines and oil fields.

Speaker 4:          07:43          I believe Africa is going to become the next manufacturer. Flow, photo work and poverty will not be a destiny and millions of people you Africa will escape poverty. Thank you all.

Speaker 1:          08:01          The woman you just heard is Helen. Hi. And she's a Chinese businesswoman. That company is Gian and it makes shoes for big brands. If you have gas or Calvin Klein shoes, it's very likely that they were made by this company and I bet you can't guess where it's biggest factor is. Well, it's actually located not in China, but in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia is capital.

Speaker 3:          08:24          Let me

Speaker 1:          08:25          think about it. In the nineties, China was the Mecca of cheap labor, every large American or European company, which that of its factories in cities such as Shenzhen or Guangzhou, so, but as the country grew salaries group two, and it's by the year 2011, Helen, hi. Realized that if she wanted to cut costs in terms of salaries, she needed to find another country and that country was Ethiopia once more. Helen, hi. Wasn't traveling alone. She had the Chinese government support which address the Ethiopian political elites and told them, look guys, if you just let us do things our way, we can cover the country with factories, with money, jobs, and as we often say, visual politic as it will said. So it was done.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Industrial Park is already operational and Ethiopia wants it to become a manufacturing hub, but we're not just talking about Ethiopia here. There are Chinese factories in many other countries twice. It is a company that manufactures ceramic tiles and it's main plant is on the outskirts of Nairobi in Kenya, and we can also find new industrial parks and other countries like Ghana. Even though Chinese companies are supported by the governments, we're mostly talking about private investments here and I probably can guess what you're thinking right now that these companies are making cheap things so they can sell them. So rich countries, Rice. Well actually not really. For example, Star Times is a company in Tanzania made with Chinese capital and it provides cable television since they reached the market. Cable TV prices have dropped by 95.

Speaker 3:          09:57          Thanks.

Speaker 1:          09:58          That more than $10 million Africans can enjoy a service. That was a luxury and the same is going on with telecom. Companies like Huawei have flooded the market with cheap mobile phones. In fact, nowadays the same amount of Kenyans use mobile phones as Europeans and of course to connect all these industrial centers, the Chinese government has spared no expense. Do you? To the new Silk Road we talked about previously, the so called one belt, one road project that Xi Jinping launched. Well, the same thing is happening in Africa and we're talking about thousands of kilometers of railroads and roads that have changed the landscape of several areas of the continent. In other words, unlike France, China hasn't tried to colonize Africa, but instead has turns them into business partners and thanks to that they have managed and more money and more influence. Fucious institutes are raising generations of pro Chinese mandarin speakers throughout Africa and now you're wondering, well, what conference do about this? Are they just going to sit by while China and gulfs the market? Well, we'll see common interests. It probably won't surprise you to learn that a large number of African countries aren't exactly legal safety paradises that have a lot of respect for the law. We're often talking about dictatorships out. Others, I'll simply failed states that can barely contain the fights of various tribes. That means setting up a factory in a country like Gavin is much more complicated than setting one up. For example, in a place like the United States,

Speaker 3:          11:38          it isn't

Speaker 1:          11:39          enough to buy land and get a permit. You need to have government contracts. That means in these cases, diplomacy plays a fundamental role. Or in the how I told you that froms controls its former colonies governments with an iron fist. Well, you can imagine the rest of the story.

Speaker 3:          11:53          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:57          French companies must go on the offensive and fight to the growing influence of rival China for a stake in Africa's increasingly competitive markets. For instance, minister pro Muscovy chief said on Saturday,

Speaker 1:          12:08          as you can imagine, if France doesn't want China to invest in its former colonies, it has enough tools to prevent it and that's why Chinese money has banny reached these countries. Of course Beijing has paid for some projects in countries like the Ivory Coast and Ghana, and there's little in comparison to Ethiopia or Kenya. However, things could start to change. The new French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to turn the African situation around and it looks like it's already started. Revives Francis Partnership with China in Africa. As mccrone said at the press conference, China has the money and we have the knowledge of the region. In other words, France would be willing to allow the African politicians they control except Chinese investments in return that require a piece of the pie. Of course, this news is from January 2018, so there's still a lot to do before we can see how this agreement turns out.

Speaker 1:          13:06          So now the question becomes, do you think France will change its policy, consenting Africa and started treating its former colonies? Is trading partners or will they just continue to exchange nice sweats? Well, leave your answer in the comments section below.
