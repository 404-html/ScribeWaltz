Speaker 1:          00:00          That's conducted experiments. Just go and Google these two words. Donald Trump,

Speaker 1:          00:10          what did you get when you googled them? Well, I'm sure you found lots of results about his latest tweets, his latest bold statements, or maybe his latest sexual scandal, but you probably have to click to the seconds or even the third page to find out anything about what is actually one of his biggest political bats. We're talking about something that might change the international economy. It might change the price of oil and the fate of two countries. Yes, dear viewer, I'm talking of course, or maybe not. Of course it was on that third page of Google. I'm talking about the Iran sanctions. This is such a complex matter, but we will make not one, not two, but three videos covering all of the various caveats. In today's video, we're going to focus on one question. What does the nuclear program have to do with the price of oil, and at the end of this video, you're going to see where I'm coming from. As with every good story, we should start by introducing our characters. The first one is of course, the Islamic Republic of Iran, a country known for Persian carpets, uranium enrichments, and of course oil.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Iran has the fourth largest amount of dinosaur juice reserves on the planet, but that is not all. If you've been subscribed to visual politic for a long time, you already know that there are different types of crude oil. For example, if you want to extract an oil barrel in Scotland from the North Sea, you've got to build a sea platform. You've got to make a super deep hole that goes below the bottom of the ocean and then use a rocket technology to refine it. In total, a barrel has an extraction cost of more than $44 in Iran. The extraction cost is less than a fourth of that. Along with Saudi Arabia, they have the cheapest oil on the planet,

Speaker 3:          02:13          so well, what's the problem? Jeep all sounds great. Well, they can't sell it to to most countries. Iran's economy is virtually isolated from the rest of the world. This means they can only export about 3 million barrels per day of oil. Although due to the threat of sanctions, there are currently only exporting about 1 million barrels. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:32          per day.

Speaker 3:          02:35          That might seem like a lot, but it's nothing. If we compare it with the 7.5 million barrels per day currently being exploited by Saudi Arabia, which is currently producing nearly 11 million barrels per day in total,

Speaker 1:          02:48          it's an the, you might be wondering. Well, Simon, who is Iran's worst enemy is America. Ryan Stone.

Speaker 2:          02:53          Sure. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:58          you're wrong. Aaron's arch enemy is actually Saudi Arabia and yeah, I know both countries or Muslim, both countries follow strict religious principles and both countries consider human rights. Well optional, but not all of Islam is the same. And Iran, Shia Muslims are the majority. While Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Muslim country. So do you surmise they hate each other, but that's another story for another video. So what is Saudi Arabia's problem? Well, despite having oil and lots of money, there are, comedy is the edge of collapse. Basically they spend all of them. I need living like a hip hop artists. On a Friday night. And since they don't export anything other than than oil, anytime the price of the barrel of oil goes down on the market, their economy goes into panic mode. So now you might be wondering, well, who's Saudi Arabia's best friends? Well, this is actually when America comes into the picture.

Speaker 2:          03:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:59          All right. All right. So the relationship between Uncle Sam and the Saudi royal house is not as wonderful as it seems from the outside. During the Obama administration, the White House puts some pressure on the Saudis and tried to get closer ties with Iran. This is how that nuclear deal came about. Now the president is Donald Trump, and from the moment he stepped into the Oval Office, trump has made it clear who is ally in the Middle East was this is why his first official trip was to the Saudi capital of Riyadh. Even now, after the alleged murder of a Saudi journalist in Turkey, Donald Trump is trying to avoid making a from condemnation, but the best proof of his friendship with the Saudi royal house are the Iran nuclear sanctions. Yep. You heard that, right? So now you might be wondering, well, what does Saudi Arabia have to do with Iran sanctions? What does oil have to do with any of this? Well, today we're going to answer these questions, but before we do, as always, let's take a look back at the head

Speaker 4:          05:05          straight

Speaker 1:          05:08          political ball. Remember this date, April, 2015 this was the date when Barack Obama signs the Iran nuclear deal. Basically in this agreement, America, China, Russia, and the European Union said that they would start trading with Iran if they stopped then nuclear program. This explains why from one day to the next oil exports from Iran almost doubled. Just have a look at this

Speaker 4:          05:31          chops

Speaker 1:          05:37          to Obama's deal. Iran. Ron was making 1.8 million barrels a day after the deal. Iran increased it to as much as 3 million barrels. Then Yukon's bill, how was Spain, France, and other European countries, and what happens when the oil supply on the international market increases? Well, the price of a barrel of oil drops and you just have a look at this other chart.

Speaker 1:          06:03          At the moment, the deal was signed. The brand's barrel with 67 US dollars just a year later. It was twice as cheap. Of course, there are many other factors that could explain this price drop, but Iran, it was definitely one of them, but the, hold on just a minute because this really is just the beginning of our story. Now, longtime visual politics subscribers, which you should be subscribed below, you already know how hard it is to extract oil. You need technology, you need companies, you need money and lots of it. In other words, if the National Iranian oil company wanted to produce more oil barrels, they needed investors, and this was when the real financial bom APP, so lately draw, you're Rabia is considering an IPO of Saudi Aramco, potentially the world's most valuable company. Let's pause right there. Why is this news so important for our story? Well, let's rewind a little further.

Speaker 2:          07:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:27          Financial explosion. Now I'm going to ask you a question. What is the world's biggest company? Now, many of you might reply with apple or Coca Cola or, or maybe some big bank somewhere that you might've heard of. Well, actually, it's none of those things. The world's biggest company is actually Aramco.

Speaker 2:          07:48          Okay?

Speaker 1:          07:49          This is Saudi Arabia's national oil company. However, they waste your time finding it on the stock market. It's not only is it not public, Aramco is owned by the Saudi royal family. Nonetheless, having the world's biggest company, it doesn't mean you can't go bankrupt. You'll see as oil prices go down, Saudi Arabia is in dire straits. They need to diversify their economy. They've got to gain wealth from other things other than just petroleum. So how can they do this? Well, essentially the big idea was to start a hedge.

Speaker 2:          08:31          Sorry. Audio Rabia

Speaker 1:          08:33          wants to grow its sovereign wealth fund to over $2 trillion. Now, weird as this might seem, this wouldn't be the first time a whole country invested in businesses. In fact, the world's biggest hedge funds actually belongs to the Norwegian government. This audis, they just want to make something similar. So this all sounds pretty good. So what's the problem, Simon? Well, they need money then. It's 20 of the world's biggest company. Where did you get money from? Well, you just sell something, your company on the stock markets and that gives you all of the cash you need. It's basic business. This way. The Saudi royal family would kill two birds with one stone. First they make money and they also keep Iran from getting that juicy investors' money. You remember how he told you when in 2016 around once invest investors to build new oil rig swelled before those investors would consider Iran, Saudi Arabia at wanted to dangle a suite at piece of candy in front of their eyes and that was of course Aramco, but hold on a minute, it wasn't that

Speaker 3:          09:32          he see listing a company on the stock market is great cause all of a sudden you get a lot of cats. The problem and your turn for being a publicly listed company, you must make your books publicly available after all, no one would invest in a company if they can't see that company's financial statements to see how they're making money and how they're spending it. In other words, you've got to be transparent and you have to remember that transparency is the least favorite word of the Saudi royal house. You'll see for decades, the Saudi Monique's have basically been using Aramco for anything they wanted, policies,

Speaker 1:          10:08          luxury, and those sorts of things that you probably don't even want to know about, but this is not the problem. According to Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as mbs Aramco is worth $2 trillion. That means that this 5% he wants to sell would be worth $100 billion. Nonetheless, as soon as he started talking about the IPA, all these various financial analyst started making their own estimations and they essentially said $2 trillion bad with the price of oil falling like this. Are you smoking crack? Best case scenario, best case, you're looking at one point 2 trillion or one point 5 trillion. F we're being rarely, rarely generous. Hello? Where's that financial explosion that the Aramco Ipo was supposed to be? Basically the game, nothing but a buzzword and he's, I'm in the past year. Anyone asked Prince Salomon, what he thought about this. It basically kind of respond like this. Uh, yeah. Yeah. You know, man, it's legit. Another day. I'm busy with print stuff at later, man. Later. Hold on a moment because this is still not the end of our story.

Speaker 2:          11:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:15          A crater in the markets. Here's another day for you to remember that may at 2018 this is the moment when trump broke the Iran deal and announce a new economic sanctions.

Speaker 2:          11:28          Yep.

Speaker 1:          11:29          Not only that, he also promised secondary sanctions against those countries that would not comply. In other words, if any country wants to buy oil from Iran, well, they'd also have to deal with Uncle Sam and June off Agastya that that also includes the end higher European Union. Other countries don't really catch. I know for example, has said, you know, I don't care trump, whatever, we're going to buy it all from Iran. India, the second largest client has said that they will try to reduce imports, but they can't. 100% stopped buying all from the country of the ayatollah.

Speaker 1:          12:02          Nonetheless, it seems like the EU will have to follow Donald Trump to the latter even if they don't want to, but this as a matter we're actually going to discuss in the next video. The truth is nowadays Europe is buying more than 1 million barrels from Iran every day. This means if we take it ron, out of the equation, we have a whole 1 million barrel order of it. Somebody has to fill because you know one thing is absolutely clear throughout all of this, everybody needs that sweet, sweet dinosaur juice and I bet you can guess now who is very, very happy to be filling that role.

Speaker 2:          12:38          Boy,

Speaker 1:          12:43          trump pressures Saudi Arabia to increase oil production. Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia just increased its production by 600,000 barrels. Russia has done say by 200,000 and if you do the math, it's not tricky. You get 800,000 barrels. We still need more to fill that huge void and you probably also remember what happens when we reduce the oil offering on the international market. Oh Yeah, supply and demand kicks in and the price of that oil barrel goes up. Let's get back to our Brent shot. If you pay attention, you will see that right after trump started talking about the Iran sanctions, the dyno juice, it went up to $80 in other words, things are starting to go really, really well for the Saudi economy.

Speaker 2:          13:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:33          Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund raises $11 billion loan. So what does this mean? Well, two things. On the one hand, the Saudi royal family now has a lot more breathing space for that. Aramco IPO, the company is now profitable enough that they can wait before going to the stock market. So I'll lazy prints, he doesn't need to worry about it. On the other hand, if they could keep the oil barrel at 80 US dollars, it would be way easier to hit that initial valuation of $2 trillion. And while that explains news like this, Saudi Crown Prince has ipo for oil giant Saudi Aramco will happen by early 2021 meanwhile, there are two things we should cover. First, the Islamic Republic of Iran is at the edge of economic collapse. This is leading to protests, social unrest, and an authoritarian regime. That is having a very bad situation. Seconds we have the big question is the EU gonna comply with trump sanctions? The debate, it really couldn't be hotter these days.

Speaker 1:          14:34          You asked to protect firms from donald trump's sanctions against Iran. So now the question is, do you think we are at the beginning of the end of the ayatollah's regime? Do you think the European Union will keep from buying oil from Iran? Well, we'd love to read your thoughts and theories and in the following videos we're going to see quite how much they match with our own.
