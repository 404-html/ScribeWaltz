Speaker 1:          00:08          The world's best country if you don't want to be alone. This country has half the population of the United States, but concentrated in an area the size of Illinois. It is the most densely populated country on the planet. It's also been one of the fastest growing countries in the last few decades. In less than 20 years, Bangladesh has cut poverty in half. Avi Leader in textile manufacturing only surpassed by China. In fact, I'm pretty sure your shirt, your trousers or something else you're wearing right now was made bath. Let's wait a minute because it is still too soon to open the bottle of champagne. Yes. Bangladesh grows faster, but still to date, 13 percent of their population lives on less than $2 a day and that's 20 million people add to this. The fact that Islam is the main religion in the country and you get headlines like this one

Speaker 1:          01:02          activity increased in Bangladesh in 2016. I made global fall and attacks dislike the fact that Bangladesh has a secular constitution. Adulterous women are stoned to death in some regions and 80 percent of the population agrees with changing the legislation. So that it meets the principles of Sharia law. Meanwhile, despite the radicalization of some citizens, the prime minister shake of Ciena is a woman and the opposition leader, a leader is also a woman. So the situation that is far from quiet, especially given that in the next year, 2018 Bangladesh will hold elections that might be crucial for the future of the country. Questions that we find ourselves asking, oh well Ken Bangladesh become an Islamic republic. And why do we think Bangladesh is a demographic time bomb? Well, today we are going to answer these questions, but before we do that, let's take a look back out the history. One Country to families and 1947, the British empire, let's the Indian colonies become independence. The parts were Hindu, isn't was the main religion became what today is known as

Speaker 2:          02:11          dm

Speaker 1:          02:15          with an Islamic majority became Pakistan, but things are not as simple as they seem. The listening pause ended up divided into two parts. As you can see on the screen now, India was in the middle and to the left and right there was Pakistan with a political system. Based on sharia law, 2,200 kilometers divided, these two paths that belonged to the same states, and as you can imagine, this just didn't work very well. In fact, putting aside the fact that they have the same religion, these two paths, while they had nothing in common, they didn't even speak the same language.

Speaker 2:          02:50          Western Pakistanis

Speaker 1:          02:51          despise the eastern Pakistanis, also known as the Bengalis and wanted to have their own country. So in 1971, the liberation war starting estimation say that somewhere between 300,000 and 3 million civilians died in the sport, but as a result of brand new country, I was born and this was the People's Republic of Bangladesh. This is also how Mujtaba Rahman, or as they know him, Bunka Bonduelle became the first president since Pakistan was an Islamic country, and Bangladesh hated Pakistan badly. Bangor then do you designed the constitution that was completely secular. In fact, they followed the ideological fashion of the time or the so called Arab socialism. This wasn't ideological cocktail that combines authoritarian leaders, a centralized economy and secularism. Wait, just a minute here because it really wasn't that easy for years later, Bangor bands zoo and this whole family died and acute atar made by those who supported Pakistan. You rule during the liberation war, only his two daughters survived. One of them shake a Siena is the current prime minister, but let's look back at that cue to top after two years of political stability in the influence of the CIA General Zia Rahman became the man in China.

Speaker 2:          04:10          Sure

Speaker 1:          04:15          that his most controversial decisions was to give amnesty to the pro Pakistani. Therefore Islam as soldiers who killed Banga Bantu. This is how the big ideological divide was created in Bangladesh. On the one hand, we have the family and the political party of General Ramen. The BNP or Bangladesh National Party, they are a conservative coalition with a strong presence among isn't Mr parties, some of those who participated in the cute Atar. In 1975 became members of the BNP party. On the other hand, we have the party of Bangor Bansi, the circled Awami League. They are considered socialist and secular. Romans rule the country for four years. Then of course, then another cute Atar, Bangladesh was ruled by the military until 1991 when democracy came back to the country, but hold on a minute again here, because the Bangladesh way, if democracy is pretty far from democratic tree to women since 1991, these two political parties had two main leaders. On the BNP side, we have Kalita Zen, the widow desire ramen. On the army side there is shake Asina, the daughter of Ngabantu. Since then, elections have been a fight between two women. This alternate empower every five years. Neither one of them can win the elections consistently. In fact, elections in Bangladesh, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          05:42          Hello,

Speaker 1:          05:46          the opposition party organizers, violence protests and paralyzing strikes that damage to the country,

Speaker 2:          05:56          but in 2006 well

Speaker 1:          05:58          things they changed back then. The Awami League, leds by shake Asina disagreed with the way that they organize the elections. This was pretty business as usual, but this time the military tried to make a cute. It's odd, but some audit in the country like they had in the 19 eighties elections had to be postponed for two years and finally sheet casinos won the elections. In that moment, I learned a lesson. The important thing is not winning the office.

Speaker 2:          06:23          Keeping

Speaker 1:          06:26          not. Remember when I told you the general robin gave amnesty to those. You've killed Banga Bendu 40 years before. Well, his daughter shake Kasina had a pretty good memory and she took those memories from the past and decided to do something about those Islamists. He might challenge power. Those who participated in the 1975 at a time executes leader of largest Islamist party. If this wasn't enough, she broke up. Uh, one of the biggest political traditions in Bangladesh. Usually during an election, the parliaments would create a neutral governments in order to guarantee a clean and fair process was not willing to leave power. The opposition boycotted the elections and to Siena one with 79 percent of the vote. When ash ruling party wins after boycotted vote. I don't have the words now in 2017. Shake a scene or is the strongest leader in Bangladesh's history, and this is no little thing if we remember that this is a country of more than 160 million inhabitants. So the question is now, is there anyone who can match a scene as power? Well, the answer is actually yes. Graphic bomb, as we said at the beginning of the 20 million Bangladeshi citizens live in extreme poverty. They are young and extremely religious. In other words, they are the perfect market for a radical Islamist movements. And Yeah, I know you might be saying right now, but. Well, Simon did not say that Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing countries. Well, yes I did. And this is exactly why there's 20 million poor citizens

Speaker 2:          08:02          problem.

Speaker 1:          08:10          Yes, and if you want to start the populist revolution never go to an extremely poor country. In fact, most of the radical movements appear when countries are starting to grow or stepping out of a crisis. This is your window of opportunity. That is the moment when the worst off citizens can feel jealous of those who are getting wealthier and wealthier. Those $20 million impoverished citizens are imperfect targets for radicalization and it can be a real threats to our country stability. This is why it terrorist attacks have been getting more and more frequent in Bangladesh since 2013. The victims are bloggers who claim to be atheists and trying to spread secularism in the country. That's the real wakeup call that came in. Two Thousand and 16 long letter should attack isis. Gunmen killed at least 22 people in the hostage crisis at Daca restaurant since then shake us. INA has been trying to stop terrorism. Nonetheless, as I said in 2018 elections will be held and the government is trying to gain support from that religious population. This is why it has seen isn't letting Saudi Arabia invest $1,000,000,000 into the building of 160 mosques throughout the country. At the same time, she is making it harder for women's who inherits money and also making it easier for young girls to marry much older. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:30          Amen.

Speaker 1:          09:41          It doesn't stop there and Islamic propaganda group because half is that he Islam send their agenda with political suggestions. Do you have governments, for instance, they wanted the religious teachings given a radical mosques to be considered at the same level as any academic institution and against the odds shake Hasina has accepted that as well as other proposals from the radicals. Don't forget that she and her party are the ones that stands for secular values against a more traditional approach from the BNP party.

Speaker 1:          10:16          So this leads us to the big question here. Do you think Bangladesh is at risk of becoming a de facto Islamic republic, or is this just a political game? Sheik Hasina to strengthen her power before the elections? Well, you can leave your answer in the comments section below and please do also visit our friends at the reconsider media podcast.
