Speaker 1:          00:00          Venezuela is undergoing some of its worst moments. This disaster is so huge that what was once one of the largest and most powerful oil companies in the world, PDVSA is now practically bankrupt and has more problems including extracting the oil. So how does the oil company with the largest reserves in the world have problems extracting? Yes. Well that's what we're going to talk about in today's video, folks. I think we all probably know it's Venezuela is undergoing a true catastrophe and not only an economic one, it is above all a humanitarian catastrophe. It's such a huge disaster that in recent years it has caused between three and 4 million Venezuelans to flee the country. That's more than one in every 10 inhabitants. And the truth is we're not really surprised by this. Si, according to the latest statistics, 80 at 7% of the population that's nearly nine out of every 10 Venezuelans are poor. And on top of that, most of Venezuela's population, 60% isn't only poor. They live in extreme poverty. Not only that, Venezuela is burning down according to data from the Venezuelan social conflict. Observe a treat in 2017 almost 10,000 protests were registered throughout the country. More than 27 per day. And what's even worse than this?

Speaker 2:          01:40          Well,

Speaker 1:          01:40          according to information from Attorney General Luis Ortega, since 2015 the police, the national guard, the army as the different intelligence services have killed more than 8,000 people. Of course, most of them were opposes to the right

Speaker 2:          01:54          Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Hunger, violence, repression, everything indicates that Venezuela will soon undergo a refugee crisis of colossal dimensions because let's be clear their view, and let's be honest, things they're not looking good.

Speaker 2:          02:14          You see,

Speaker 1:          02:14          for years the Bolivarian Revolution of Chavez, Maduro and company has a great ally and there we're not too worried about Cuba or Russia or any other country. As a matter of fact, we're talking about oil. The black gold that financed the revolution for a long time, the huge income, this raw material brought, financed all of the regimes, policies, ends. They didn't really care about the consequences. So, I mean, factories were closing, foreign investment was fleeing the country, but it didn't matter because while they have loads and loads of money from all of that oil, but all of that, well it's about to end. Yup. Venezuela does have a lot of oil, but one thing is having oil and another thing is being able to exploit set oil. Did you know that Pdvsa the national our is practically about to collapse. Well, listen, up the fall of pedevesa petroleum of Venezuela, PDVSA was created by government decree in 1976 do you integrate all the oil assets that the state had nationalized this company soon became a world class colossus as you know. Why? Well, among other things, because this company has the largest reserves on the planet as when we say large, we mean large. There are more than 300 billion barrels of oil certified here more than the reserves of Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Russia, or any other oil power. Now, yes, it is true and we have set it on this channel before. Venezuelan oil doesn't have the highest quality, but that doesn't really matter. We're talking about a huge amount of resources, almost 20% of the world's noon

Speaker 2:          04:00          herbs,

Speaker 1:          04:02          and the fact is that this company paid evasive peaks in production in 1998 a year before Hugo Chavez came to power, at which time the company was extracting three and a half million barrels per day. Since then, things have changed a lot. By the year of Hugo Chavez death in 2013 production had decreased by 1 million barrels per day day. So could it be that Hugo Chavez bothered area and government didn't like oil? Could it all be part of a twisted, bland, do diversify Venezuelan economy? Well, in fact, it's quite the opposite. If he had known me, do you want me [inaudible] petroleum Hugo Chavez to increase production to 5 million barrels? The problem was that they simply weren't able to do it. But if you think that that command, his results were bad, you haven't seen anything. Yes, because since Nicolas Maduro came to power, production has sunk to 1.8 million barrels. That means like while countries like the United States of doubles their production, Venezuela produces half as much oil has when the revolution began. So hardly a fantastic success. And if you think that that's the worst of it, get prepared. Do you think again, because the future is looking a lot more bleak. So at this point in the video, you might be wondering, well, what on earth is going on with paid a visa?

Speaker 1:          05:47          The keys of a disaster for toll.

Speaker 3:          05:50          Okay, databases.

Speaker 1:          05:51          History. Divya has been the story of a disaster for tolls. The best example of that, the Power wanna refining complex, which consists of three crude oil refineries and just one of the three largest complexes of its kind in the entire world. For years it was Venezuela's industrial pride, the crown duel, if you will. However, today it barely operates at 15% capacity and all kinds of accidents tend to happen. Well, why is this? There's no maintenance. They sucked everything they could from pedevesa without investing, there's nothing left to squeeze. Publishes Pedis Plant Operator, and this is certainly not an extraordinary case at the end of October. Also in the [inaudible] refining complex and why refineries spills over 200,000 gallons of gasoline into the bay a few days later, another refinery in the complex, the card on refinery itself to fire that fireman could barely contain because they didn't even have the foam to fight the flame.

Speaker 2:          06:48          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:49          long and on and on it goes because the truth is that most of the old companies facilities are in terrible condition. So how do you think that they reached this point? You see, the Chavez government always saw paid a vase, a as I kind of dairy cow from which they could get all the resources they needed for the revolution. The problem is that the oil industry, it requires lots and lots of investments, and these are investments that the Venezuelan government simply did not want to make. Even with that fact, it's still indebted the company to the Brim. And by the way, do you know how indebted this company is today? Well, listen to this, we're not talking about one or 5 billion. We're talking about 90 billion American dollars. A fortune so big that Venezuela could have even bought multinationals like Goldman Sachs, Nike or semen

Speaker 1:          07:51          is just an insane amount of debt. But do you think there's a that's going on? Well, not even close. They also use the company to plug in place and hire thousands and thousands of supporters, friends and family members around which paid a visa, lost even more resources. And if that wasn't enough, the Chavez regime also placed unskilled and inexperienced personnel in management positions while dismissing and driving away thousands and thousands of experienced employees because of that political beliefs. Yes, this is how pdvsa ran out of money and ran out of human resources. And now with all of this information, we can really understand why oil production is dropping in Venezuela. And of course the consequences of all of this. Well, they're terrible for the country.

Speaker 3:          08:38          The consequences

Speaker 1:          08:43          oil is essential for the Venezuelan economy, especially because there's no other industry left standing. That dependence on oil is so great that it generates 95% of all foreign currency profits in dollars and these currencies, div Ua, I won't finish. Swayla needs to be able to import food medicine, gasoline. Yes, indeed. When I swayla still today has to import gasoline as well. There's pretty much everything else, but of course there's oil production keeps plummeting. The country is able to import less thing. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:17          and you know what? Since Venezuela is producing nothing fantastic, we import everything. The dwindling oil money is no longer enough to pay all the bills. But of course, as you will know, when you spend more money than you make, money goes away. And that's precisely what's happening to Venezuela, which according to some calculations, valley has $10 billion in foreign reserves, which is that lowest number in 40 years. This means that when the money is gone, they won't be able to import anything else than what they can buy with the money they make from the oil, which she is decreasing. So you're probably beginning to see the problem.

Speaker 2:          09:51          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Previously talked about on visual politic. I'm Nicolas Maduro, has government has tried to buy time by resorting to international markets to issue desk has pretty scandalous rates, sometimes as high as 40% obviously issue in debt with implicit rates of 40% can only mean future ruin ends. In any case, that's actually no longer a possibility. In fact, both of the Venezuelan government and Pedevesa are incurring defaults that is a on not paying that debt. I said Pete downgrades seven sovereign Venezuelan bonds to the default level and other they attempted was that of the Chinese rescue and the Chinese answers and place more than $23 billion in loans on the table. Everything has a limit and they are no longer willing to continue giving more money and getting nothing in return. Let me just check this out. The Chinese oil companies seen OPEC sue's pit of Essa for unpaid debts. The situation, dear viewer, is so desperate that the Cuban government has decided to seize the 49% that paid a visa held in a Cuban refinery is compensation for that unpaid debts. Yep. Yeah, that right. Not even Cuba trusts the maduro regime and it was all of this that led to the latest Chavista events for Petro.

Speaker 4:          11:08          Yep.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Venezuelan, crypto currency. As we've seen with everyday that passes, the Venezuelan government has less access to foreign currency, which is obviously a huge problem because without a foreign currency they can't import, but based on this problem and idea came up, cryptocurrency is in fashion, so why not launch their own cryptocurrency? While they did and they called it the petro

Speaker 4:          11:31          not good enough. They're not going to be good for the older. Maybe your mountain tell too, because

Speaker 1:          11:49          course the petro is a very particular currency among other things because it's controlled by Maduro is governments under these conditions. Let me ask you a question. Would you be willing to invest a single euro or a single dollar into this new crypto currency? In other words, would you put your money in the hands of the Venezuelan government? Well, you can bet that I would and not even a single penny and precisely because no one in their right mind would do such a thing. The Venezuelan government as hat due back. This particular cryptocurrency with oil that is each petro will be guaranteed by a barrel of oil from the Venezuelan oil reserves preserves. That of course are still undergrounds in this way. If he petros value as apparently linked to the value of this raw material

Speaker 5:          12:39          [inaudible] and you can get fairly Paco [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:48          Does that sound any better? Well hold on for either because we cannot forget a detail, a very, very important detail. They are reserves are of course under the control of the government. As I wonder, do you really think that this government is going to exploit those reserves and even if they did, do you think that really back the petro and what about the support rates? We didn't, the resources generated some DB spends, wouldn't they impose restrictions or regulations that would benefit? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:13          Them.

Speaker 1:          13:16          Why take the risk of investing in Petros? And by the way, another important point here that petro, it's not convertible. That is to say even though it is supposedly backed by oil barrels, you can never exchange it for the barrel or any title that proves a right over those barrels. The Petros a cryptocurrency that isn't crypto, that it's backed by reserves that aren't reserves. It's going only be monetized or the production that is collapsing and issued by a government that is in default and has no dollars. Francisco Menotti, professor at the rice universities, Baker Institute in Houston, folks, the battery doesn't seem to be anything more than a last ditch. Attempts to gain time and try to obtain the greatest possible number of dollars by taking advantage of the popularity of cryptocurrencies and perhaps of capitol laundering because well, who would put their dollars on the table?

Speaker 1:          14:06          Fact is that if this crypto it doesn't work in, that does look like the most plausible scenario Madora his regime. Well only have three options. First, accept some kind of internal revolts and leave power one way or another, which seems very difficult. Second views and even tougher hands and condemn Venezuela to even greater humanitarian disaster or third, try to get the Chinese and Russians to by the country's national resources on mass hands. By all means trust that refineries, that oil and maybe other raw materials. That is to say they would essentially become a sort of colony by selling at a loss each and every one of their crown jewels so that the regimes are leads, can continue to enjoy their standard of living. So now today, Nicolas Maduro in company, they're still in power and it hardly seems likely the Venezuela is going to have a better future, but now it's your sound. Would you be willing to exchange your money for that? Trey's well leave your answer in the comments below as well as in this survey and is, I really do hope you enjoyed this video.
