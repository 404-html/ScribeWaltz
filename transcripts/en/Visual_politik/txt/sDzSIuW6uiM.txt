Speaker 1:          00:07          The country with the highest density of famous musicians put our capital in the entire world. Ireland is a country with less than 5 million inhabitants. Even Boston has a larger population, but as small as the population maybe Ireland is the cradle of well known music like any of the cranberries, and of course Bano for view.

Speaker 2:          00:24          See,

Speaker 1:          00:26          there is another thing that makes Ireland's famous as well, and that's the. It's the second wealthiest country in the eurozone. Further Irish people have more money than the British or even the Swiss, and this is surprising given the just 30 years ago, Ireland was as poor as Greece. Yep. You heard that right back then, one in every five Irish university students were emigrating to other countries. Today, there are more people with Irish blood living in the US or Australia than there are in Ireland

Speaker 2:          00:52          self

Speaker 1:          00:57          nonetheless. Now this country is home to some of the world's leading technological companies. Firms like apple or Google have their tax headquarters that many of you might be thinking now that that simply because of the low taxes there right now, of course it is absolutely true that Ireland does offer good fiscal conditions for companies, but other countries like the Republic of Liberia or the seashells also offer pretty low corporate taxes and then not even half as rich as ours. The question here is, what have they done to grow so fast? How is it that even after the financial crisis, Ireland remains wealthier than Switzerland? Did I? We're going to answer this question, but first as usual, we're going to take a look at the history.

Speaker 3:          01:40          The poorest of the wealthiest

Speaker 1:          01:42          islands was born in 1922 years, but before that the whole island was part of the British crown. I ended the relationship well. It wasn't exactly great for the English politicians. Island was a lens of Catholic peasants who were unwilling to work and devoted to having lots and lots of children. This explains why after they got their independence, the New Republic of Ireland is cut. All of that ties with London. Well, actually it wasn't just London, they closed off their relationships with the rest of the world as well. Even during World War Two, they were the only English speaking country that captain neutral, but not only that, the different Irish governments closed their gates to international trade. They even put a ban on foreign as owning or investing in local companies. So now the question is, what was the outcome of all of these policies? Well, he knows that that would be a brutal economic crisis.

Speaker 3:          02:30          Fortunately enough, because Irish people spoke English, they could easily move to the United States. We're not talking about adventure just a few decades. The Irish population reduced by half, and of course the national industry never grew as it was expected to think about it in such a small country, it is impossible to find the tools and resources needed to build factories and machines. There just isn't enough industry. They needed to import them, but because

Speaker 1:          03:00          the government put so many fairs and barriers to foreign trade, it was pretty hard to get the material needed to start a new company. This was in 1957. The governments of Shawn Thomas Kelly made islands town or one 80 on that trade policy. This is how they went from not buying anything that's opening their gates to the entire world. Right after that, they signed a free trade agreement with the UK and a decade later they would enter the European community, which later came to be called the European Union, but hold on just a minute. My Dad, Libertarians, he might be watching this video, just hold back here and things, the them for a moment because this openness to free trade was not exactly as good as expected.

Speaker 2:          03:45          Think about it.

Speaker 3:          03:46          For decades, Ireland was closed for business. I had nationalized many of their companies. When a company knows that they have no rivals in the market, share is guaranteed by the government. They have very little reason to improve. This explains, for instance why in 1988 people in the city of Cork, which is in the southern part of Ireland, had so many electricity breakdowns and brownouts, they're wiring network hadn't been replaced for decades. The same happened in many other industries.

Speaker 1:          04:17          All of a sudden the Irish economy allowed people to buy goods abroad, new products, more competitive products. They appeared in the market. So now you're probably wondering what happened to those local producers? Well, unsurprisingly they disappeared. Ends with thousands of people just lost their jobs. In 1987 islands reached and unemployment rate up seventeen cents. Once again, the Irish youth started packing up and moving.

Speaker 2:          04:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Then following visual politics for some assignment, you'll probably know that integration isn't really much of a problem for our country. Can you guess what the real issue is? Well, actually it's exactly the opposite. The migration we need to consider is who was leaving audience, but it was the university students and it was those people with higher skills. This cause what is known as a brand, but believe me, there's more than this in order to attract the multinational corporations, the government, lower taxes, and of course this strategy worked out well. Firms like Intel, apple, Microsoft, they chose Ireland as the place for their European headquarters. So now you might be wondering why. What's the problem with this? This sounds great. Well, they essentially just opens up a tiny office with an accountant. This means that their contribution to the country's wealth was actually funny.

Speaker 2:          05:35          Paul, if

Speaker 1:          05:38          this was not enough, the same government that put the red carpet out the companies was also raising income tax on it citizens. Some people ended up paying 60 percent in tax from their salaries, and if this was not enough, Irish legislation did not make it easy to hire people. So now considering the situation, jobs are disappearing, local companies are going bankrupt. Government spending is on the rise and thousands of Irish people just leaving the country. In 1988, the Economist magazine published this.

Speaker 2:          06:05          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:08          of the rich. Poor Ireland behaved as though it was rich. Now it must pay the price. All right? All right. All right, so that's the bad stuff covered. Now, how did they step out of the scenario? Well, let me tell you a story.

Speaker 1:          06:27          The Celtic Tiger roars. It was the in 1987 and Charles Hall, he had won the elections in Ireland as a country on the edge of collapse. Mansi realized something. You can't open your economic system without first modernizing it. Of course companies like oracle or HP, what happened to be an islands and pay less taxes than they were paying in the us, but where are they willing to? I've been a research center. We're a factory that would employ a thousand people we have who isn't and why? Well, first they would have to deal with the labor laws, which were a bureaucratic nightmare. Not only that, what you said about the 60 percent income tax. This means that no matter how high the salaries for the worker were, a fairly large chunk of that is still going to the governor.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Highly skilled professionals would rather just moved to the United States. So the first policy implemented by Jorge was to deal with trade unions and the company's salaries would grow at the same rate as the economy was on the other hands. He lowered income taxes this way. What has ended up making more money, even if the wages were the same and this soon started generating right salts. Packard like slipped plant is to employ 2000 people by the year. 2,000 in a short amount of all of those multinational companies that it opens their fiscal headquarters on, Irish soil started owning that own factories and offices. Meanwhile, unemployment, it was going down, wages were on the rise and even the government collected more money, but not only that, this deal with the unions and theocratic simplification helped create all new company.

Speaker 2:          08:10          Have you ever played with

Speaker 1:          08:10          Ron at both the t shirt at prime, arc drunk and Guinness? Well, all of these companies expanded internationally during those years. This explains why the Irish economy grew as much as the Chinese economy during the 19 nineties suddenly addresses in Dublin would offer champagne to their customers. Some people even flying to New York to do shopping on the weekends. These were the years of the Celtic Tiger and at that point, the economist decided to dedicate another article a decade ago, Irish and comes with less than two thirds of British incomes. Last year by one measure, they had surpassed British incomes that hold on just a moment because not everything is so perfect. Of course, during those 15 years, salaries doubles, but that optimism drove banks to offer mortgages to nearly is encouraged, ridiculous spending in those years were even companies that rented helicopters for children to have their first communion in the.

Speaker 2:          09:02          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:06          and this led to a financial crisis that we are going to cover that in another video.

Speaker 1:          09:24          now. The question is, do you think that the Irish model could help other countries like Greece or perhaps India?
