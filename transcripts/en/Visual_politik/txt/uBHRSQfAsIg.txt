Speaker 2:          00:08          Thursday, December 28 2017 the year was bound to ams and the world gets ready to welcome 2018 like every year. Newsrooms are practically on pause and Tony talk about three basic topics reuse on 2017 predictions of what 2018 may bring and to news about how the arrival of the New Year we'll be celebrated in nitty every corner of it.

Speaker 1:          00:29          The wells,

Speaker 2:          00:36          however you have, you are thirsty to some of the 28th when the year seemed to be over. This news came out, numerous protests and demonstrations began to emerge throughout Iran. It all began in the city of Masada. Historic, she knows pilgrimage site, the hometown of the supreme leader, Ayatollah common aim, and it's one of the bastions of the regime.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Well, surprisingly it was here in this Islamic Revolution Sanctuary for the first antigovernment protests emerged. Some demonstrations spread quickly throughout the country, resulting in more than 20 deaths and over a thousand detainees. But that's that time when everything was beginning. Many people wondered if we were witnessing the birth of a new kind of Persian spring. The president of the United States. Donald Trump seem to suggest that Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama administration. The great Iranian people had been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food and for freedom along with human rights. The wealth of a ram is being looted. Time for Change Butts. Just the moments if we really witnessed an incipient Persians spring, have we rarely seen the powerful ayatollah's regime wobble? Well, no, we haven't. Not imminently at least you'll see what I mean. And just a moment.

Speaker 2:          01:53          However, not being at the beginning of a Persian spring doesn't mean that Iran isn't undergoing events that are very important to the country's future. Hands by extension, important to the future of the Middle East. So the viewer here we have three key questions. First, why do these protests occur? What would their cause seconds who lit this entire movement spark? And third, what can we expect? Will these events have any effects on Iran? Well, let's answer these three questions and see why all of these movements show us how the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the totalitarian regime that now controls the country is facing rapid erosion fires, causes,

Speaker 2:          02:40          as we've seen in previous videos here on visual politic, Iran is one of the countries with the most natural resources in the world. It has the fourth largest oil reserves, the second largest natural gas reserves as their copper, iron, zinc, uranium, and silver deposits among many other resources are also among the largest in the world, and that's not all. If that one's enough, it also has a relatively young as well educated population. For example, every year almost 5 million young people attend university. In principle, it seems like this country, you should have an easy time getting things to go well for us, however, despite this, it's economy is a disaster.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Okay?

Speaker 2:          03:24          Employment shortage in Iran, especially for the youngest who suffer unemployment rates of 40% inflation is also in the double digits. The currency has suffered notable depreciation and the government has been forced to cut several social benefit.

Speaker 2:          03:42          This all clashes head on with the huge expectations generated from the 2015 nuclear agreements. See, there was widespread hope that this government would be a turning point for the country's economy. Investments would begin to arrive in world markets would reopen to do business with Iran. President Rohani himself supported this thesis and the truth is since the agreement was signed, things they have improved. Since many of the sanctions were lifted in 2016 not all of them, though the United States actually still maintained several oil production has increased by 20% public accounts have improved and the growth rate has sought to almost 7%

Speaker 2:          04:23          these changes haven't been enough among other things because the Iranian economy, it has more holes than Swiss cheese. See, corruption is very widespread. A good section of the economy is in the hands of corporations that are linked to politicians, religious foundations, and the powerful revolution regard, and they of course receive all kinds of privileges. It isn't fair that a lot of Iranian suffer, while a large part of the budget is allocated to Islamic organizations whose functions we don't know that well, poverty takes over everything. Even people's religion Mussa of retired person and participate in the protest rallies in Tehran. In fact, it is estimated that it's a bit more than 20% of the economy belongs to what we might consider the purely private sector. Yup. Really only 20% c doing business in Iran is really, really complicated. Seeing the world's banks doing business ranking, which measures how easy it is to do business in a country ranked Iran in position 124 as if we take a look at the economic freedom index. The results are even worse. They occupy the 155th place and well Iran, it isn't even a World Trade Organization member and it maintains average tariffs of approximately 25%

Speaker 2:          05:42          I did that. When's enough? The government spends huge results is abroad, can Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen for example, which in addition to spending a loss of Iran scas money fuels the investment community's panic. Just think about it for a moment. Who is willing to their savings in a country like Iran? I mean, don't tell me that's not just a little bit scary. The main problem comes from the revolutions export ideology and from supporting the Shiite groups from Lebanon to Yemen. The system spends money on these campaigns without taking the needs of the people into account far Mars, last student and activist. Of course, the results of this disastrous motto falls on the shoulders of Iran citizens, especially its youngest, and this is important to it because it is estimated that around 50% of the country's population is less than 30 years old. Now we know what sparked this protest, but is behind all of this. Who organized the first rallies? Could it actually have been the United States as the Toronto regime denounced? Could it have been a well organized and well prepared? It's political opposition. Well, let's see that. Listen, I've hit because you might be surprised.

Speaker 1:          06:51          The instigator.

Speaker 2:          06:56          At first they were as usual, several interpretations about what was happening and one of them was the theory that a popular revolution could be starting a very particular Persian spring.

Speaker 2:          07:07          However, do you view, it was soon clear that some pieces did not seem to fit at all. See, on the one hand is protest, it's exploded in some of the most controlled and most talkative cities in the country. On the other hands on, like for example, the so called 2009 green revolution this time the main role did not fall on the middle classes, which tend to be more secular and reformist, but curiously on the poorer conservative causes. And so on top of that, the first protest of messages were aimed mainly at the president's isn't clear who has organized these demonstrations, but most slogans were against raw honey. How mom had, he is as ours, editor in chief c even though elections are held in Iran to choose the president, candidates are ultimately chosen by the supreme leader. The ayatollah who at the moment of truth has the last word.

Speaker 2:          07:53          This is why he's the supreme leader. While the fact is the president of Rouhani, honey is let's say a reformist and a soft hearted political leader of course, as much of a reformist and softhearted vertical leader as we could expect in a regime like Iran. And while he may not have reached every expectation, he did take some steps towards a certain amount of openness in the country. Under Mr raw honey, strict Islamic rules have been somewhat relaxed, concerts have been allowed, and the morals police are largely off the streets. Illegal parties that usually no longer rated, although there have been exceptions. So if what you're demanding are more reforms and more freedom, attacking the most reformist president would seem, at the very least rather curious, don't you think? Well, as you might imagine, this does have an explanation. The powerful revolution regards main chief himself, Muhammed Ali Jafari made it very clear at first, the instigators leader was none other than the former president Ahmadinejad himself. That's right. Ultra conservative groups organized the first protests to erode the reformists political capitol bird of course, in a country where 50% of the population is less than 30 whether it's widespread frustration. And above all smartphones and Internet access. It's not a surprise that the contagion spread very quickly within hours. The calls to protest spread through social networks and communication applications such as telegram, the most popular application and the country. Suddenly spontaneous protests broke out all over the car.

Speaker 1:          09:21          I'm sure

Speaker 2:          09:25          of course, complaints about the economic situation we're seeing joins by demands for freedom. Yes, we could really save the all of this got rather out of hands for the ultra conservative.

Speaker 2:          09:37          Of course the government didn't take long to reactions. Use the force. We can all imagine a dictatorship like this has detentions, considerable threats, and even capital punishment due to rebellion, freeze in connection with foreign intelligence services or began as for the recent days, developments in the country and it means have been united to create problems for the Islamic system by using various means including money, weapons, politics and security apparatus Ayatollah Khomeini, their response was so big that the government has just announced a prohibition on teaching English in primary schools supposedly to avoid cultural invasion. As you can imagine, all of this stops the protests. However, even though we aren't facing a Persian and spraying, the fact is that all these events showed several of the totalitarian regimes weaknesses, yes, have a failed revolution since the Islamic Revolution took place back in 1979 the wrong government has made a lot of efforts to achieve a strong national identity built on religion. See, according to the Iranian news agency, there are more than one and a half million. Yes, one and a half million clerics teaching the Koran and promoting Islamic principles in schools and in all kinds of educational institutions. However, despite all these efforts, Iranian society, which as we saw is very, very young, is becoming increasingly secular and increasingly dissatisfied with a country model. If that lies far from their way of thinking. As you can imagine, the Internet has played a key role in all of it.

Speaker 1:          11:12          Yes.

Speaker 2:          11:15          Well, if we add the regimes inability to generate opportunities for all these young people to all of this, it isn't unreasonable to think that we will witness a very fast erosion of this country's political pillars in the next few years. Mind, do you? This is harder to imagine in Saudi Arabia, and even then, we are beginning to see it with the changes that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is introducing. Well, they Raelian society is much more open, much more secular, independent of religion and better formed. So, well, we'll just have to wait and see. But now it's your turn. Do you think that the ayatollah's regime will be able to contain such a changing force where we begin to see changes in Iran? Well, leave your answer in the comments below.
