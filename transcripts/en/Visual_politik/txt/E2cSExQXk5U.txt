Speaker 1:          00:07          Every time, less than American government tries to discuss foreign policy and development, they ended up discussing regional integration. That is why we should understand the three main common features of Latin America, football, soccer for you Americans, revolutions and the regional organizations. Seriously, we're really not kidding here. In the last few decades, there have been so many regional organizations that it is almost impossible to know what goals each of them have besides obviously being an excuse for spending money on public workers headquarters and traveling. These are unison, Mercosur, Albert Caricom, Sanilac Ld, the Indian community seekers, seller, the Rio Group, and of course the Organization of American States, and to be honest, I'm probably not even mentioning all of them there anyway. Once you hear about all of these organizations, you might be thinking the Latin America is the place where people get on with each other. The best. A place where it's really easy to do business among the different countries.

Speaker 1:          01:03          I'm where governments work together for the common good in some sort of wonderful paradise, right? When all the bad news is. If you didn't guess that none of that is true. All of these organizations, they were born with these really wonderful home ideas, but we could say they all really did nothing for developments and economic and political integration in Latin America. New institutions are created, but it isn't clear what to do with the previous ones. It is an endless fight forward. Carlos mood look just by all the different processes of integration. Trade is strangely low among these different countries. Those are important. Yet the share of exports inside the region. It hasn't changed much and it has been around 20 percent, which is much lower than in other parts of the world. This is pretty strong evidence about how artificial and unproductive these organizations. We'll see the details of this case though. The word disappointment or failure would probably better describe Mercosur boss. I can already tell you that it is very possible that this lack of real integration is the origin of some of the most important problems that the region is facing. Turnell promise

Speaker 1:          02:20          in America is to view is it's a fantastic region. It's got great natural resources, it has significant biodiversity and its climate is very unimpressive. Many people would say that the region is one of the most beautiful on a,

Speaker 2:          02:38          the

Speaker 1:          02:39          economically speaking, things on not looking so great despite all of these magnificent resources and ditch great potential, the region has been left behind in terms of economic growth. Let's compare, for example the current Richard's country in Latin America and that would be chilly. So I think most people would agree here that shit. He's done a pretty good job in the last few decades. Right? Well, despite that apparent progress, just have a look at this.

Speaker 2:          03:03          Oh No.

Speaker 1:          03:12          We have taken the richest country in Latin America and have competitive to South Korea, which is not even the richest country in eastern Asia. Ben's weld. The difference is pretty obvious. In the sixties, Chile was a poor country, but was far richer than South Korea.

Speaker 2:          03:26          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:28          well things. They're rather different. Look at Argentina, which was once the richest country in Latin America with the exception of Cuba, but now we'll take a look at its evolution when compared to Spain.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Well, one of the causes for this lower growth, my precisely be the low trade integration and the access protectionism and bureaucracy that the region has always suffered from. I mean there are loads of agreements, there are tons of committees and forums and all of that stuff, but when the rubber hits the road, it was really nothing there but do hold on for just one second because a few years ago a new integration project it was put into place and this one is actually completely different to the rest. Not only is it the first project with real success in the region, but it might also change the destiny of Latin America forever and here we're talking about the Pacific alliance civic alliance, April of 2011, all friends, Chile, Columbia, Mexico, Peru formed the so called Pacific alliance. It's mission is to finally achieve and integration, so the goods capital and people can move freely around the region. All of this was put in place with the idea that it would stimulate growth development and competitiveness in these economies.

Speaker 2:          04:58          Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:00          Teresa account for 55 percent of Latin American exports. This is not a romantic integration, political integration. It is a realistic integration before the world and to the world. Alan Garcia, former president of Peru, man, so they did. Even though there's still a lot of work to be done since then development, it's been really significant. Six years. These four countries, they've removed 92 percent of customs tariffs and they've set a deadline to remove all of the rest as well. Along with this, they've simplified the bureaucracy of customs and administration, especially when it comes to rules about the origin of goods. This was previously a significant burden on the region.

Speaker 2:          05:45          Alright. All right,

Speaker 1:          05:46          so up until now, if a Colombian producer used Peruvian supplies, he couldn't take advantage of the free trade agreements between Columbia and Mexico when selling his goods to Mexico, which just crazy. That's not the end of it. Visa requirements, they've also been eliminated, so the movements of visitors has actually doubled and then, and this is very important, there have been significant advances in financial integration. These four countries have created the m I l a, the American integrated market, which is meant to be the largest stock market in Latin. Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:21          American

Speaker 1:          06:25          oldest, more among other initiatives. The countries in the alliance are working together in order to be known in international markets. They have also started to share embassies in African and Asian countries and they have decided to negotiate altogether for their free trade agreements. For example, they've actually already started to do this with New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and Singapore. Australia and New Zealand start trade talks with Pacific alliance. In other words, these four countries are building step by step, a unique market which will be rather significance. We're talking about 240 million consumers with a combined GDP, which makes this alliance one of the eight largest economies in the world.

Speaker 2:          07:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:08          This is an economy that represents 50 percent of all exports and more than 40 percent of all foreign investments in Latin America. We could say that if the Pacific alliance keeps it up in a very short time, we might have to consider it the biggest power in Latin America, but in order to understand a bit better the achievements that they've had in only six years, we should look at the other large group in the region and that would be fall of METCO.

Speaker 1:          07:38          Okay, so it was created in 1991 by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay with the intention of creating one large integrated market. Well, these were ambitious goals, but the advances, we've been pretty damn modest. And how about some evidence of this? Well, just have a look at this. The trade among Mercosur members represents today less than 30 percent of the total trade of its members in 1995. That was almost 20 percent. Rather than encouraging trade between its members, we could say that Marcus has actually weakened them in the last few years. Microsoft has become some sort of protectionist shield rather than something which is working to integrate these countries further. Not exactly what they wanted in the first place.

Speaker 2:          08:24          Group

Speaker 1:          08:24          is become little more than an antigo talking shop, but why isn't this working? Well, that's mainly because the countries, they're not really very committed. In theory, Microsoft is a process of economic integration, but there are so many exceptions and restrictions. That's in the end. There's no free movement of goods or services. Microsoft has become something which is totally ineffective. A good example can be found on the border of Argentina and Uruguay. In theory, the goods should be able to move freely between both countries. However, the reality is of the difference when adding customs, inspections and bureaucracy. A truck from Uruguay, Argentina could be delayed for more than 24 hours, which is totally crazy when it's supposed to not be delayed at all.

Speaker 1:          09:10          All of this has led to Uruguay, formally asking, do you become a member of the Pacific alliance and there is more to this story. Still the political change in Argentina and Brazil has led to both of their governments. Accepting that marcus, or at least as it is understood today, is almost completely worthless. We'll never reach the common market. The custom union is completely destroyed and the free trade area is not working either. Mercosur isn't a dying state. Danilo is story minister of Economy in Uruguay. This is why Macri has decided to become closer to the Pacific alliance and look the ties between both processes of integration. The real question becomes now will the Pacific alliance creates a change in America, so if it does, then that would be great news for the entire region, civic pumas.

Speaker 1:          10:05          Now of course, the question that we have to ask is, well, why is the Pacific alliance on like any of those other organizations, the only one that seems to be working well maybe this has to do with these so called Pacific Pumas, Chile, Peru, Columbia, and Mexico. These countries have been the most dynamic economies in Latin America and they share the same vision. They all agree there's in order to grow and develop, they have to produce and do business with the rest of the world, and this is why according to the welds bank, these humans are the country where it is easiest to do business or were more trade agreements are signed with the rest of the week.

Speaker 2:          10:38          Well anyway,

Speaker 1:          10:48          the Pacific Alliance represents one of the best opportunities for Latin America to be in a position to become the talk of the town. It wouldn't even be too much of a stretch to say that we could be witnessing the birth of a great economic power, but now it's your turn.
