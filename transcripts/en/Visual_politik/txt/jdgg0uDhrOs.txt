Speaker 2:          00:07          Israel does not have the world's biggest army bus. It is the most effective. Think about it, we are talking about the country with less than 9 million inhabitants. Nonetheless, they have won wars against countries 10 times bigger. For example, during the six days war, Israel confronted a coalition that included Egypt, Syria and Jordan. These countries put together sums up to more than 130 million people and they sent over 240,000 soldiers twice as many as the Israeli army debt. In other words, no one would expect a victory for Israel. That history was rather difference in just six days of the Israeli defense forces also known as IDF wiped out their enemies and yes, I know where you're going to say now the Israelis have the best technology and weaponry, right? Well, that is true now, but it wasn't back then. For instance, in 1973 during the Yom Kippur war, Israel's weapons where as modern as those of their main rivals, Syria. In fact, the IDF had some combat jets manufactured in the 1950s the famous a four Skyhawk. However, the Syrians, they had state of the art anti aircraft to isles. They were given to the Soviets just five years before. And you won that wall. Yeah, it was Israel. All right. All right, so I can hear something you're saying no. Oh, come on. Sign. But Israel has the sport of America. That's a really big help.

Speaker 2:          01:31          And yes, at this point you are right. Israel is the country that receives the most help from Uncle Sam. But do you know of any other country who buys the best weaponry from America? Well, that would be Saudi Arabia. The Saudi's have an army as big and as modern as the Israeli one. But if you've been subscribed to visual politic for a while and you already know that the big failure of the Saudi army was fighting guerrilla warriors, namely those who see rebels from Yemen. In other words, neither the technology nor the American's support are enough to explain why the Israeli army is such a fearful. Yeah. So the question of the day is why is the Israeli army so powerful? What are the key elements explaining such military success? Well, today we are going to tell you the five key facts that explain this fast decision making. Every almay is based on hierarchy and authority, right? Well, some of them, they're more flexible than others. In this other video, we explained how the Saudi army and has a bigger sense of hierarchy and the officials don't have much power to make their own decisions. The same goes with other Arabic countries like Syria or Egypt. It's like, here is an example. Imagine a Syrian unit defending a position. Let's say the headquarters have been destroyed before the soldiers in the front line are aware of it.

Speaker 1:          02:49          That's

Speaker 2:          02:51          if they have to follow the normal procedure. They will have to wait until someone gives them an order during this time, they don't know if they should retreat, strike back, or coordinate with other military units. All right, so now you might be wondering, well, why are Arab armies so centralized? No, don't forget the, most of these countries aren't dictatorships or absolute monarchies. If you are a higher and you want your army to be under control in order to micromanage every little decision in order to prevent acute attack, he is rainy. Ami is way different from that. Let's look back to our previous example. In this case, the is rainy commander on the front line. Would it need to wait for orders? He has a degree of his own decision making power so he can react immediately and seize opportunities. In fact, this is pretty normal in almost all western armies. The big planning is centralized, but the execution is decentralized. This way the organization is more flexible and can react more right

Speaker 1:          03:44          quickly.

Speaker 2:          03:48          Unlike the western countries, Israel has something unique in that culture. We all talking about a pretty unknown fact about this country. Yes, it is a very, very important one. Israel is the least hierarchical country on the planet and you can feel this in every aspect of their culture inside of an Israeli company. It's pretty normal for an average worker to have a discussion with his boss debate site a common thing and there is a pretty small sense of authority. Actually in the 1970s of Dutch anthropologist named Geert Hofstetter studied the power relationships in different countries. Over the course of six years, he surveyed ibm workers in different offices around the globe. This is how the power distance index was born, and among all those countries, Israel has the lowest power distance. While the Arab countries like Egypt or Saudi Arabia rank among the highest. In other words, Israeli citizens are educated in flexibility more than any other nation. Yeah, internal cohesion in Israel military service is mandatory for every citizen regardless of their social condition or that gender. Both men and women, rich and poor start from the very

Speaker 1:          04:57          awesome.

Speaker 2:          05:03          Well, actually this is not entirely true because the ultra orthodox Jews don't need to do military service and neither does Israel's Palestinian population, but the rest of Israel citizens must serve in the military and fall into a meritocratic scheme. This means everyone must follow the same rules in order to be promoted, and this is not as common as you might think. For instance, during World War II, the aristocrats grants who joined the British army started with higher positions and the peasants and the working class. As of course, it's such elitism, it tends to destroy an army's morale and make it harder for it to function. For example, the Saudi army consists of both civil sevenths ams, members of the royal family. As hierarchy matters a lot. The son of the Saudi prince will be a soldier, and as you can imagine, this classist structure has negative consequences.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Combat

Speaker 2:          06:07          morale. In the, in 1973 Israel forced the Egyptian and the Syrian army at the same time. As we said at the beginning, back then, Israel was not the technological powerhouse that it is today. Syrians had those antiaircraft guns, the Sdu hundreds that we mentioned before, and during the first days, those anti aircraft missiles destroyed a lot of Israeli combat jets, Israel answer retreat. Nonetheless, Uncle Sam was here to help. The White House sends a package of weapons so they could neutralize the Sdu hundreds and the radars, things like flags that could confuse the smart missiles that would guide it by temperature this way. The Israeli struck back and in a short amount of time they finished off the Syrian defenses as well. Guess what happened next? Well, the loss of those Arab soldiers scared of being wiped out from the air. Well, they defected. If you look at the picture on the screen, you will see seven Syrian tanks. They are not moving, but not one of them is destroyed. Well, it means that the soldiers that were inside of those tanks, they decided to run away. Defection is a common problem when morale is low, and this is a common problem for Arab army

Speaker 1:          07:22          s

Speaker 2:          07:25          Syrian troops defect to southern Turkish province of Hottie. Think about it. If you aren't an Israeli soldier or an American one, you know you must be loyal to your country, but Arab soldiers have too many ethnic, national, and religious identity. Imagine you are a Syrian soldiers and at the same time you are occurs or you belong to the Muslim Brotherhood. Both groups aren't chased by the Syrian government so well. Who were your loyalty? Of course the army pays your bills, but when your life is a risk and everything is lost, when what's more important? Your salary,

Speaker 1:          07:58          life,

Speaker 2:          08:02          no matter your wealth and your technology. If your soldiers are not strongly motivated, you've already lost ans the Israelis, they know that better than anyone. Capitol old tanks place their engines on the backside, but why is this? Because usually the rocket center on the front side, Angie wants your tank to keep working even after being hit. This is why all the models from the German leopards do the Russian tea nineties keep that engine's in the back. Nonetheless, the Israeli army doesn't value the vehicle as much as their soldiers. This is why the Israeli mccarver is the only one of its kinds of, that has the engine's in the front.

Speaker 1:          08:45          This

Speaker 2:          08:46          way, a rocket will destroy the tank, but it will protect the soldiers. Putting aside the ethics, Israel has a really small population. This means that they can't allow themselves to lose too many soldiers. This is why they receive much more intense training with real bullets and better equipment. And don't forget that this is the country where craft mudguard one, it's the most advanced martial arts was born. You can also see this human capital doctrine reflected in their intelligence service. The massage, it is considered one of the best in the entire world.

Speaker 1:          09:13          Wow.

Speaker 2:          09:17          One day you happen to travel to Israel and you should know that they will take your phone number and other data because they know information is power.

Speaker 1:          09:26          Yep.

Speaker 2:          09:26          All right. All right. I know what you want to hit. Now, you came to this video because you wanted to hear about state of the art weaponry, Rice. Well, Hey, you have this made in Israel during the 1980 it's the Israeli government wanted a secret weapon, a weapon no one had ever heard of until recently. So they met our local manufacturer or company called Rafael. Do you design a very special vehicle? The so called para.

Speaker 2:          10:00          This is a vehicle that looks like a tank, but in fact, as a tank hunter weapon with a big rocket launch chat, if you know about weapons, you know there's a big difference. Tank weaponry has to reach a distance of between two and four kilometers. Perrier rockets can travel and distance of 30 so imagine the situation. The enemies would take satellite pictures to see the Israeli weaponry. And as they would see a lot of normal tax based on this, they would turn their strategy, but then surprise, surprise those tanks on not tanks and bars. In fact, something with a much, much bigger, right?

Speaker 1:          10:30          Sure.

Speaker 2:          10:34          The decades this para was one of the most mysterious weapons if the Israeli army and their main strength was that no one knew anything about them. So now the question is how come Israel makes it's own secret weapons and other countries don't? Well, the answer is that in Israel there are a lot of rocket science companies that give it a worldclass defense industry. So a while ago we did a video about Israeli startups. Well. In the 1980s the Israeli government created a special program which was called a yells map. This program consisted of 10 hedge funds with both private and government money in them. Those funds helps to create a lot of tech companies and you know what the favorite industry for those brand new startups was? Well, of course it was the military industry. At the end of the day, the army, it was a rich and reliable clients. All of a sudden, dozens of weapons manufacturers were born companies that created customized products that met the exact needs of the Israeli army at every

Speaker 1:          11:26          moment.

Speaker 2:          11:29          Iron don't defense system to the Merkaba tanks or the parade we mentioned before. Now you might be wondering what happens in the other countries. Well, let's first consider Saudi Arabia. As you note, the sound of your economy. It's got a problem. It relies heavily on the oil industry. Of course, thanks to the dinosaur juice. The Saudis have become a rich and they can pay for the third biggest army in the world, only surpassed by China and America. Expensive is not a synonym for good. The Saudi army buys their tanks from the USA ends. Those are customized for the needs of the American army. Like does that makes it harder to have a secret weapon because everyone knows what you bought on the international market. All right, so I probably know what you're thinking. Now. It seems that we're really talking up the Israelis rice, but do you make no mistake, the Israeli army certainly has its weak points. In fact, there is an organization that could make their life even harder, but that's something we're going to talk about in another video.

Speaker 1:          12:30          Nope.

Speaker 2:          12:31          The question for you is who do you think can defeat the Israeli army and what do you think their main weak point saw? What?
