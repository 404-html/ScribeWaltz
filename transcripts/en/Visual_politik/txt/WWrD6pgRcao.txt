Speaker 1:          00:07          Run out of these one of the most innovative companies on the planet, and yet it also manages to be one of the most hated. Yeah, yeah. We've all heard of companies like tesla or hyperbole, but. But let's be honest, it's going to be years before those companies actually change lives. If they ever, dear ron and I have created a revolution or ready and I'm not worried about European. Ron has sway. You can be felt worldwide, but on the other side of things, it's hard to find someone who doesn't hate this ally. This is partly due to the efforts of its CEO, Michael O'leary. He seems to have worked really hard to become the man you love to hate with quotes like this one,

Speaker 2:          00:41          but we need fewer people queuing to go to the toilet. How do you get fewer people queuing to go to the toilet, charge them for it, or how about this one? Nobody wants to sit beside a really fat that's on board. We have been frankly astonished at the number of customers who don't only want to tax people, but torture them.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Well, it's actually another reason people hate ron already. If you've been following this channel, all my others, you might already know that I live in Prague, in the Czech Republic. Now, why Paul is on this channel, they live over in Madrid, in Spain and until there's a very month, the cost of a flight to go from here in Prague to Madrid, cost about 250 American dollars, but this year, well Ryan and I came down and they managed to offer Prague to Madrid routes for about $90. And what did the other airlines do in response to this? Well, they were also forced to lower their prices and this didn't just happen between Progam Madrid. This happened all across Europe. Anywhere Ryan out operates the rest of it's competitors. Hats put down their prices in order to remain competitive. This meant lower profits or even potential bankrupt.

Speaker 3:          01:41          Let's see.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Just to have a look at British Airways in the year 2000, they carried over 46 million passengers, but just eight years later they didn't even carry 33 million. And of course, those big airlines like British Airways or Lufthansa or Iberia, they spent a fortune buying ads in the media and well, because it was ad buy, they want the love of journalists sand. Well, you know, you didn't have much love from journalists. Well that would be ryanair because they never really bought any apps. Well, despite this bad reputation, there are only a few companies that can claim to have changed an entire industry the way that Ryan did. And as I said before, this is not only a European thing, Ryan air effects can be felt around the wells except perhaps in Latin America.

Speaker 1:          02:31          So the first question we have to ask here is, how did Ryan ever changed the world? Why do regions like Latin America need a company like this? Most important of all, how does Ryan App managed to author these ludicrously low prices? Well, today we are going to answer all those questions, but first let's take a look back at the history. Why is Ryan Air so cheap? Back in the 19 eighties and Madrid salons in flight cost the equivalent of $700 back then in Spain. This was the average monthly wage. Everyone understood that flying well. It was a luxury. I mean at the end of the day, planes, they're really expensive and there wasn't really anything anyone could do. Nevertheless, the reason why flights with that expensive actually had little to do with the technology and just had much more to do with politics. Yes, this really is true because back then average, they will based on agreements between governments. For instance, the French government and the American one, they had a deal, so only French and American airlines could fly between Paris and New York City. The same happens with the rest of the European countries. Airlines. They had essentially a monopoly over the roots that they operate,

Speaker 1:          03:49          so there really was no incentive for them to lower fares because they could simply make a fortune selling $700 tickets. Back then it was really only British and Irish people. You could enjoy it, Ryan as lower fares, but then in April of 19, 97 things, they changed for

Speaker 2:          04:09          any technically qualified airline in the European Union. Plus, Norway and Iceland will be able to run services inside any other country.

Speaker 1:          04:17          All of a sudden, all these European carriers, they could compete against each other. They didn't really know how. This is why they are heavily invested in advertising and more luxuries. They make that a food more comfortable seats and even gave corporate gifts to passengers. Ronna instead, they. That's on a totally different strategy.

Speaker 2:          04:40          Airlines are asking how they can put up barriers. We are asking how we could get rid of them

Speaker 1:          04:46          saying this in 1997, it was totally crazy. Of course there were already on the budget guidelines like the American Airlines, southwest, but runner, they wanted to go even further. This is why they found new ways to reduce the costs to an absolute minimum. For example, the landing cost depended partly on the of the town lines, paid to the airports landing. It's Brussels central lab is costly, but 60 kilometers south, if there is Charlotte Roy airports which offers way lower landing fees simply by choosing to fly to that airport. Ryan at, they saved another cost saving policy, was utilizing the same athlete model for all of the roots and this airplane. It was the Boeing seven, three, seven other companies like Lufthansa, they worked with over 14 different types of airplanes. This means they needed 14 maintenance technicians. Each of them are specialized on a different model of aircraft. Ronna instead, they could do the same with just a few experts. This means that while Lufthansa needed hours between flights, do maintenance checks, Ryanair needed half that time, and of course after this, the rest of the extra costs that they saved during the flights do you want to use on the airplane? Well, that's extra. Do you want to carry on baggage that's extra to you. Want to choose your seats every year, Ron and finds new ways to reduce costs. For instance, a few years ago on the backs of their seats, they started posting adverts, but the real turning points in this company came in the year 2000. This was the time when Michael O'leary made a decision that changed the entire industry for

Speaker 3:          06:20          bye.

Speaker 1:          06:22          The travel agents take the out and shoot them. What have they done for passengers over the last years in the year? 2,000 runner was the first company to create a website where you could book tickets online. Prior to that it was impossible to buy your own plane ticket unless you lived close to the airport. So travel agents, they were a pretty essential middleman. And of course these travel agents, they've charged commissions and these conditions went up to 30 percent now in stats passengers could just go to the website to find the cheapest flights. And then bias, do they. This is completely normal, but back then it was a revolution and they put lots of travel agents, business with all of this. By the year 2010, Ron, eh could offer tickets for an average price of 40 US dollars. I mean, that's cheap, but it's pretty ridiculous when you consider these $700 to get the we were talking about before. All right? All right. So now you might be wondering, why aren't we saying cheap flights, uh, such a revolution. Think about it. Since Ryanair extended its business in Europe, the amount of passengers has tripled. Pay attention to the chart here because we're talking about much more than tourism here.

Speaker 3:          07:26          Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:29          thanks to cheap flights. Students exchange programs have multiplied by five since 2007. In fact, if you are watching this video from anywhere in Europe, you might have studied abroad with an erasmus programme or have a friend do did, and the same goes for labor mobility, which has tripled in a decade. It would be hard to measure all the small businesses that have been born thanks to cheap flights. They can even allow the most modest freelancer to find clients and another. Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:53          I'm sorry,

Speaker 1:          07:58          hold on for just a minute because there's another detail that we must keep in mindset. If you look carefully, you will see that while flying has increased in Europe, Latin America seems to be immune to those changes and didn't like to say that the air effects it was worldwide. I mean, well what happens in Latin America, the Ryanair effect. I know what you're thinking. Ronnette just operates in Europe. I mean, how could they have such a big influence on the rest of the wells? Well, I'll let you draw your own conclusions. Take Airasia. They were an airline owned by the Malaysian government at the beginning of the two thousands that you want on the verge of bankruptcy. Then in 2011, the Malaysian businessmen, Tony Fernandez bought it and followed the Ryanair model that it started to work in Europe and Asia. They adopted the slogan and now everyone can fly and they offered to the first low cost flights on the continents. Suddenly Corolla the important Macau could be done for less than $90. It happened Europe, Asia then

Speaker 3:          08:55          sold the birth of many other low cost airlines from lion era of Indonesia to Cebu Pacific and the Philippines. Even a country as poor and as big as India has seen it, the amount of passengers triple in just 10 years.

Speaker 1:          09:12          Hold on again for just a minute because there's still that pulse of the planet which seems immune to the Ryan Air Effects and this area as we mentioned, whether it's Latin America for example, a cheap flight between Bogota or in Colombia and Mexico City costs $460. John's compare that with the $86 that you could pay going from quality important Taipei, and in case you want to check the distance, both are more or less than

Speaker 3:          09:34          dot,

Speaker 1:          09:38          and the same goes if you want to go from Libor and Peru to La Paz in Bolivia. This is a three hour flight and it costs $600 and yes, this is more than the average monthly wage in most Latin American countries. So now you might be wondering why is it so damn expensive to fly in Latin America? Why don't they have some Ryanair like company? The answer lies again in politics. In other words, legislation in the region has made it impossible for a company to appear. If an airline wants to work in Brazil, they need to have at least 20 percent of their capital owned by resilience and two years ago this percentage, it was even higher. This is why it went avianca re, Colombian carrier wanted to open two markets in the country. The government forced them to start a brand new company with their headquarters in Brazil. Thus Avianca runs Avianca, Brazil, all two entirely different companies. Despite the fact that they do belong to the same group that Brazil, that'll be any country that protects their analysis.

Speaker 2:          10:43          Year 2016, Argentenians wanted to fly. I could only choose between two companies. Argentina, Lat am a private carrier and outer your lineage. Argentina's a state owned airline for decades that Christina Fernandez, the administration made sure no other airline could compete with these airlines,

Speaker 1:          11:02          and the same goes for the airports, the that could cut costs. It's thanks to you taking off and landing at airports. Well, this is possibly in Europe because one out of every four airport, some managed by a marriage between the government and private companies.

Speaker 1:          11:19          Thanks to this airports must compete with each other by offering better services and love affairs. It's not by chance that half of European air traffic comes from private airports. Latin America though it's a different story. Most of their airports are managed solely by the governments. If there is no competition, they simply have no interest in reducing fats. And other words Brian Enter is failed to have an effect on this region because of politics and well. What are the consequences of this? Well, despite the fact that there's many Latin American countries have grown economically in the past few years, flying is still a privilege for the rich.

Speaker 4:          11:52          This is my vision. I've been to the mountaintop. I've seen the lights.

Speaker 1:          11:55          Now the question becomes, do you think Latin America should liberalize its aspects? Do you think that everyone could benefit from a company like Ron out operating in his own country? Well, please do it.
