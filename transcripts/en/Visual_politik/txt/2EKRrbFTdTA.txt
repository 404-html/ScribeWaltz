Speaker 1:          00:08          In 2017, it'll be 70 years since India broke off from the British empire and became an independent country, which is today actually the largest democracy in the world. In these 70 years, India has managed to implement a political system with more than 1000 parties and high female participation. That is totally unprecedented in such a poor

Speaker 2:          00:28          country.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Of course, we should probably wait before we pop the champagne because we can't exactly say that these 70 years of independence have gone brilliantly in this gigantic country of more than one point 2 billion. What's the equality? A terrible cost system and many, many problems with women's rights have continued to shake this nation. That's for wars with Pakistan, which has become something of a arch enemy.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01          but if you really want to know why we might claim that India can't be proud of the last 70 years. Well, we only need to compare this country's evolution with that of China Sea. When Dung shopping launched his policy to open up China to the world and change the economic model back in the 19 eighties, the sizes of these two economic giants. China and India, they were similar in 2016. However, the China's GDP, it was five times higher. I mean, just check out this

Speaker 2:          01:27          graph

Speaker 1:          01:33          and not only that, these differences repeats in practically every statistic, social and economic and Tobias, another example. Well, while China's illiteracy rate affects less than four percent of the population in China, almost a one out of every three people can't read or write. Considering all this, we should almost reached the conclusion that the only good thing that this country has achieved, it hasn't been. It's democracy, right? Just a second, because it seems that this poverty and injustice is beginning to shift for experts, so betting that the 21st century will be above all India century. That is to say that in the next few decades, we'll witness how this country emerges from the developing world to become an economic superpower. Many companies such as Amazon and apple already betting on this transformation, ends up paying close attention to this huge market. They understand that if expectations are mess in the next few years, we could see one of the biggest business opportunities in history.

Speaker 2:          02:37          Great,

Speaker 1:          02:40          and it's not just companies, the Deli government's own expectations are so high that they expect this country's transformation to be at least as impressive as that of China in the coming decades. For this reason, they want to be prepared. They are contemplating, for example, building 250 airports, six new macro reports, and creating more than $150, million new and accessible homes in the next 10 years. In other words, everything indicates that we may see India's takeoff, which, well, that's got to be a good thing, right? Well, do you keep one thing in mind and that is the Beijing doesn't like this. They don't like it at all. Crust and resentment

Speaker 1:          03:31          is India's main trading partner. However, despite this, Chinese authorities look at India's growing economic, political, and military capacity with a lot of distrust. This is because this is a time when China wants to gain political influence and this change in India. It doesn't suit them at all. India is perhaps the only country in Asia with enough potential to offset China's political power in the region. After all, we're talking about what will soon be the most populated country on earth and there's even some analysts who confirmed that maybe this has already happened, but India has already surpassed China in terms of population size, but it isn't only that because of the one child policy that affected China for so many years, India's population has and will have more young people and less elderly people, which is quite a significant advantage given these circumstances. It's easy to understand Beijing's distrust of India. Then you agree India has the fastest growing economy in the world. We hope we're going to be catching it very soon in terms of percentage increase. I have to tell you that we're working on it now. Don't think that this feeling only exists in political officers, not at all. In fact, this growing rivalry is actually also reflected on the streets. Consider the following data.

Speaker 1:          04:44          According to a survey published in 2016 by the Pew Research Center that only one in four Chinese people have a favorable opinion of India and in India things are not more encouraging. Seven out of every 10 are worried about Beijing's military drive and believe that China's economic influence is hurting them. In other words, it seems that both China and India as populations know that their neighbors are also. They're great

Speaker 2:          05:06          rivals.

Speaker 1:          05:11          In any case, curiously, it must be said that despite all of this rivalry, Bollywood is actually quite popular in China. This summer we saw how dangle and Indian blockbuster swept the Chinese box office and it became one of the highest grossing films in China of all time and well, as you might imagine, this is something that the government in Beijing, they do really like that much in terms of soft power. India has done better than China, although India's economy is not as developed. They've put a huge emphasis on promoting their culture. John Jean Cui, director of the Southeast Asian Research Institute at Peking University. Well anyway, it would be great if all tensions occurred in let's see, such a peaceful way, but unfortunately that is not the case. Disputes in is while everyone was looking at Pyong Yang and the North Korean nuclear crisis occupied every front page, another political crisis when it was about to explode,

Speaker 1:          06:15          happens in the Himalayas more than 4,000 meters above sea level in one of the most remote places on earth. That dockland plateau in this place between June and August, one of the most serious political crises between China and India in the last 55 years occurred when Chinese troops invaded northern India. See, on June the eighth, 2017, a squad of Chinese border guards into construction team entered the territory that is disputed between China and the small closed kingdom of time. That is the country with the highest gross national happiness. Yes, that is something. We will certainly be discussing it a video someday, but well, the fact is that the Chinese unit's destroyed. Several bunkers owned by the butan royal army, and they began to build a road. However, since Bhutan's protection has been in India, Sam, since the 19 forties, Indian troops arrived on June the 16th and blocked the roads construction so far a pretty typical border conflict.

Speaker 1:          07:17          However, the tensions, they didn't dilute. They actually increased as the discussions between Beijing and New Delhi. Oh, they became quite tense. Chinese state media began to threaten the Indian government with serious consequences. China and India are dangerously close to military conflict in the Himalayas out at this point, you might be wondering, well, why on earth was a land that is practically frozen for most of the year given such importance? On the one hand, it seems that Xi Jinping's governments wanted to test India and punish them for well, a bunch of things for that relationship with the Dalai Lama and with Tibet for that growing ties with Washington for their relations with Pakistan and so on and so with regard to India because China's controlling this area with its military presence in new road would put China within a stone's throw of the Siliguri corridor and narrow strip of land is considered strategic because it connects seven of the states of northeast India with the rest of the country. This is something you'd see well on this. It's above all. Beyond the tactical issues, there's another important reason. The same reason why China wanted to test India and you're going to see what I'm talking about in just a minute.

Speaker 1:          08:28          Practice that finally on August the 28th after many threats and a lot of tension, both sides agreed to withdraw their troops and return to the starting points of this entire political muscle. Of course years ago, both powers rivalry. It wasn't as obvious as it is now, but of course let's not fool ourselves the doc cam, so it's. Well, it's the least of it. I'm not just saying this because of the more than 3000 kilometers of border that have territorial disputes between China and India that are many, many more a national strategy given them the possible emergence of India as a superpower at the Chinese governments have adopted a strategy and that's just around it and yeah, it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like. In recent years, China has tightened its ties with Pakistan in exchange for $60, billion dollars in infrastructure, especially to connect both countries, including a strategic board in China, will operate until at least the year 20. Fifteen, on the other hand is a Chinese government company has taken control of Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, a country with which Beijing is also strengthening its political ties regarding Bangladesh. China has become the most important arm supplier. Last year they sold them to submarines and finally there's an a poll which is greatly improved its relationship with China off to a political conflict in 2015 with New Delhi. Now, well let's have a look at it.

Speaker 1:          10:03          You see India is surrounded crisis. It was simply nothing more than a move in a chess game and this is a chess game in which China has the economic capacity under the money to make friends very easily. Of course, the fact that China's military superiority over India is overwhelming. Well, that's also very helpful. So a question that might arise after all of this is, well, what's India's bet? Or rather what's their realistic response as well? That response, it basically comes in three words and those three words aren't the United States.

Speaker 2:          10:40          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:40          you heard it in recent years, relations between the United States and India have become pretty close seat between 2009 and 2016 bilateral trade has doubled and the sale of military equipment from the United States to India has multiplied by 50 years. In fact, everything indicates that India is going to replace that old mig. Twenty one with a mega contracts have newly manufactured f six teams, 200 of them, and if this is confirmed, Lockheed Martin's intention, the manufacturer with pentagons approval of course, is to transfer this plane's worldwide. Production from Texas to India are pretty unbeatable way to strengthen alliances, don't you think? Well, now we can better understand not only China and India's tense relationship, but also for example, the US is new hard strategy towards Pakistan, which we discussed in our previous video about Afghanistan

Speaker 2:          11:39          as of course

Speaker 1:          11:40          all of this starts based on a premise that India will emulate the economic success that China has achieved in recent decades. Narendra Modi, the popular Indian Prime Minister of whom we already talked about is leading many changes, but not as many as the country needs, but that is a discussion we can be for another day and now we want to know, do you think China will succeed in beating India?
