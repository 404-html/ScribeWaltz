Speaker 1:          00:03          Democracy, it's a tricky concept now. Yes, we all agree that people must have a say on governmental decisions, but on the other hands were kind of scared to see what happens when the citizens are manipulated by a populist politician. This is why direct democracy and referendums are quite so controversial. In theory it seems like a great idea, so I'll ask the voters directionally about the very laws that affect them, but what happens when we actually put something like this into practice?

Speaker 2:          00:37          Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Well, occasionally you do get a rather nasty surprise, but not always. Indeed, there is one country that needed direct democracy, a cornerstone of that political system, no war. Despite what you might think. We are not talking about Switzerland here this time we're talking about liquidity

Speaker 2:          00:59          shine.

Speaker 1:          01:06          All right. All right. I know. I know. I mean, why should you care about such a small country? Well, look, Lichtenstein, it has a population of less than 38,000 inhabitants, but despite their size, their political system is one of a kind. Despite being a constitutional monarchy, most of the political decisions in this principality done through referendums. This includes economic policy. Social spending and even citizenship, yes, that is right. If you wanted to become a lichtenstein or your neighbors get to choose whether to accept or reject you through a popular vote. Even the right to self determination can be guaranteed by referendum. This means that any of the 11 municipalities in sight of Lichtenstein can hold a popular vote to decide whether they want to stay in the country or become an independent nation or sounds pretty crazy, right? Well, it certainly seems to have served Lichtenstein incredibly well along with Qatar.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Lichtenstein is the wealthiest country on the planet, at least when it comes to GDP per capita at purchasing power parity. This country is also known for its political stability. It's rule of law and its business friendly policies and well at this point in the video you might be beginning to wonder, well, how is all of this possible? How can you manage the guarantees such a stable political system when people can vote in any crazy law they want simply with a referendum? Well, this is what we were wondering here at visual politic to and to figure out the answer to this question. We decided that the best thing was to go to the country and last, so we did just that. A Gal is a village with no more than 2000 inhabitants that technically it could become an independent sovereign country if it wanted to, so we wanted to find out exactly how that would happen. So we spoke with the mayor of the town.

Speaker 3:          03:17          Great. Thank you for joining us today. I appreciate you taking the time to meet with us and just answer a few a few questions. If we could start off, if I could ask, what is the legal way for the town of regale could separate from the country of Lichtenstein and how could, how could regale hold a self referendums?

Speaker 4:          03:39          Does he facetune Dank part? It's very does to be focused on. Then now her very smugly say, does he say dish? I was making the seat somehow taken say punked room. Yeah, deceased tank, but we had food and survive that Suki hertich lunchtime leaking shine. Eastern client owned a escaped came and good wound. To me. I can type austism for boondoggles, so shaken

Speaker 3:          04:18          and as far as far as I can see here, we've been in Lichtenstein for a couple of days. The prince is very well respected here, isn't it?

Speaker 4:          04:25          Yeah. Uh, the first is to actually any respects persona owned via seen doc be counted toward Houston House just recently in Lichtenstein. Andrea Dane can the first tower we see owning his students. A start over helped me to see Owen. And when does he start? Sean oft to go to get common, some beige. Bill Boehm to bay St Louis, the OPS team for the rights to give food to at rallies rights, wilted on neat by threaten dim on the BS in Tobago. Klauber positive. Our we act on the is not nearby.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Prince Hans, Adam. The second is the wealthiest monique in all of Europe with a net worth of more than 4 billion American dollars. But make no mistake here. His wealth doesn't come from his political role, but instead from his business career, he is the owner of the lgbt banking group. One of the biggest asset management firms.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Europe.

Speaker 1:          05:36          He inherited the principality in 1989 and you can say that he is the father of the direct democracy system here in Lichtenstein. In his book the state in the third millennium. He outlined a way to implement this system in a larger country and well, this is what we wanted to talk to him

Speaker 3:          05:53          about yesterday and Highness. Thank you once again for being here. I really appreciate taking time to talk to us and inviting us to your home. What, what do you mean? It's a really broad question, but what do you mean by the state as a service provider?

Speaker 5:          06:06          I think the state should really concentrate on those jobs, uh, which the state can do better than private industry or a better than the local communities. And for me, it also important when a, uh, uh, proposals, changes of the, uh, of the constitution to all also introduced a right of self determination at every village in leakage. Dan Has the right to leave the standard principality, if they think that they get a better offer from another country or if they can make more money, uh, or lower taxation or God knows what, if they become independent. And that was for me also important, you know, also for my successes and for the politician to really to deliver very good service on low cost and therefore low cost with low taxation. Do you think that

Speaker 3:          07:08          lower cost is driven by competition? Yeah. Between the, my understanding is the local governments have of Lichtenstein is, you know, they have a lot of self determination. They're also competing with each other. Is that, could you, could you tell me a little how that works?

Speaker 5:          07:27          Yeah, the different. We have 11 villages, basically a, they compete on, on, on taxation. Uh, they compete on the way how they offer the infrastructure. For instance, give building sites to some industry knows what. So there is a certain competition services or whatever. So. So they compete on this issues basically.

Speaker 3:          08:02          So if I was a Vichtenstein Ian and I was living here and I was looking at 11 different villages, I feel, you know, again, relating to my experience, you know, I, I basically have like one country where I grew up so I'm always going to relate things to the UK. But I think about it if I, if I, I grew up in a village called headquarters and if like I guess in the next village over town or Canterbury or whatever, I get pretty much the same deal is, it's not going to be any different, you know, whether I'm working for someone or starting a business or applying to the government for a permit to do something, it's always going to be the same. But here in Lichtenstein fi I can look at what the different villages are offering and make a decision.

Speaker 5:          08:39          So religious said, oh, we have now enough manufacturing industry all, uh, also enough foreignness. It was also quite an issue because if you attract being the service, the service instead of manufacturing industry with it, you attract also workforce also from outside. Because we cannot provide all the workforce here. Not the specialist and so on. So basically, so there was no resistance. No, we have to stop and others took up the chances and uh, we're able to attract a manufacturing or service industries and therefore get more income for the village and then off of, oh, lower taxation or build a new road or a new school or a renovated church or God knows whatever ideas they had.

Speaker 3:          09:40          This works fantastically here, but in a country as large as the United States, the UK, Spain. Do you think this, is that right? To self sovereignty and that right? That works so well here in a small country. Do you think they can work in, in the constitution of, of a, of a much larger country?

Speaker 5:          09:57          Yes. I think, yes, I've seen it in Switzerland. They have it, they have this direct democracy, they have this decentralization sometimes depending on the can't on down to the small villages. I've seen it to a certain degree also in United States, of course they're from state to state. It's a little bit different. Uh, but that influenced me very much and thought that's basically a good system and a to give the people some say because usually, especially in a very centralized states, uh, as a politician or has a monarch or a monitor, a ga or president or prime minister, it takes so long until you realize that there's a problem and with that problems pop up and suddenly you'll see, oh, I didn't realize that they suddenly have an initiative being locally being on a statewide level. And then you can solve those problems bunch earlier

Speaker 3:          11:10          and Lichtenstein for reference about 40,000 people. So you go out there, you can gather these things. It's interesting because I feel this should be something if I can get a thousand of my friends together and then put something forward and then parliament have to discuss it. And if it's quite a smart idea of a constitutional change at 1,500 could happen, which, you know, Primo Fasc, you think this is going to be less stable, right? You know, the immediate thought that comes into the mind because anyone can change this right away. But this doesn't happen here and it doesn't seem to happen in other places that have a similar thing. Why do you think that is? Because many of those things are on the local

Speaker 5:          11:54          basis and you have people who are in favor of it against it and so all those things are much more discussed within the population, within the voting with the voters, and I think that has turned out to be an advantage, edited the stability. If I look at Switzerland, for instance, nevertheless I think that we have even a vest assist in this was the possibility of a veto power, but the reigning prince,

Speaker 3:          12:28          just to clarify the Swiss system, they also have a similar system of direct democracy, but obviously in a prince two visa, it's now before continuing with this interview where you wanted to get in touch with some politicians from parliaments. The Flyer list, the party is the most critical voice inside of Lichtenstein's political system

Speaker 3:          12:54          only has bonds actually used just sweet to power. In 1961, it was a hunting law. I have no idea, but it goes a little baby then, but it was about the hunting lawyers and she didn't like that and he didn't signed the, the law and that was it. He doesn't even have to say why he doesn't sign. It just doesn't sign. And since then it hasn't really been necessary. Of course, a threat to have to, to make use of the Meta powers of course has an effect on the working soft department. So you have to get over, you have to reach a consensus. It in Indiana.

Speaker 5:          13:31          I thought that it will be worthwhile to keep, uh, the veto power of the reigning prince except for an initiative. The people want to abolish the monarchy because I saw that sometimes you had in Switzerland votes, which were perhaps not in the long term interest of the country, of the people, the reigning prince. We think in generations.

Speaker 3:          14:00          We had 15 or 20 years ago, we had discussions about this dualism system and people wanted more power, but at the end there was a, there was a referendum and 65 percent of the people said, no, let's keep it like it is. You could argue that democracy should overrule the Monitor Archaic System, but it's the other way around at the moment. And that has been decided by the people referendums they often are, you know, with Brexit, it was like you just had the people who wanted to leave calling the people who wanted to stay calling the people who wanted to leave. And it was kind of this ongoing theme in relations to that. Um, how do you think, you know, in a country that has so many referendums that people can make informed decisions

Speaker 5:          14:54          at two things which we have to take. You have to take into account before you introduce it. One is that you have to start on the local basis that people read, really, uh, get trained indoors, kind of direct democracy referendums. Initiative said, saw where they can see what's the effect of a stupid decision on the village. And the city, whatever, so that they're seeing is, is, is one aspect. The other aspect is that you will have to inform the people quite a lot we have in the law and also Switzerland that you as a Jew did to inform, give the order information to have enough time for people to, uh, before vote, uh, discussions and so on, so that, that's very important and you have to hand out all the information and neutral basis.

Speaker 3:          16:01          I wanted to ask about that because it seems often the information at least I've seen is handed out by whichever newspaper you tend to subscribe to a how does that, how is that neutral information disseminated to the population

Speaker 5:          16:15          government? All the village administration, if it's just on the local vote, um, has to hand out the information and neutral information where both sides can, uh, put this information. There's a, then they can also put their own view into there. So that's handed out to all the voters so they can look it up. They organize meetings and so on. So before such a vote, it's really. That seems people are well informed. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          16:53          Those, I don't know, whenever I tend to read stuff written by government, it's as an, I think of myself as reasonably intelligence and I read some of this stuff, but I'm like, uh, like it's governments can be verbose and they're not perhaps the best at writing things in an easy to understand way. Is this information presented in a way that, you know, it doesn't require a degree to understand. It's kind of like his how it is for the every man

Speaker 5:          17:25          in your own interest. If you read in a stupid way or the highway which nobody understands is going to be rejected, right? The people writing this, of course you have to check that the, the right correct way and you can appeal to the, to, to, to court. So if there's wrong information in, there was cool. Separation of powers now, right

Speaker 3:          18:15          as I mentioned, Lichtenstein by by various measures, the highest GDP per capita in the world. So very, very wealthy country and we've been walking around and it's reflected in beautifully clean streets. Just a lovely looking place. But it wasn't always like this was it, it was, it was quite different. So, uh, I think I read kind of agrarian was the time. Can you tell me a little bit about, about the history of, of Lichtenstein, kind of before, you know, it's, it's relatively recent economic success,

Speaker 5:          18:47          what will know from my predecessor around 1700 bought the governing the rights of those. There were two counties in the holy Roman Empire. It was basically have a road bike exercise because you voted to the emperor. And so for him to get more influence in the holy Roman Empire as a prince of the holy Roman Empire, a he bold those voting rights because it was very poor. And, and the families who were raining then went bankrupt. He could have cross support by his huge estates. It was no problem. Uh, those, uh, two counties and put them together, made the principality, artificial.

Speaker 3:          19:30          So if he, he buys the lands because the possession of the land is what gives him the voting rights.

Speaker 5:          19:36          Not traded the procession of the lag, but it was the reigning powers over the land. Okay. So the land will still be partly in private ownership. That was separated. It was some kind of private who bought some counties have accounts here who went bankrupt and to pay for the. For the people who vote, they owed money. Then there was a court in the holy Roman Empire where they just sort of auctioning off the governing rights and my free says a 17 century laws, very rich, and he paid the highest price for that.

Speaker 3:          20:33          So it wasn't. In a way it was still private lands ownership. It was. He was buying the governing rights or you for what is today? Lichtenstein? Yes.

Speaker 5:          20:42          Nobody was really interested here in the land. The first one to move here to finish, that was my father in 1938 and the first of all to wizard what one of his answers to the predecessor bought. He came there, I think when the railway was built throughout Australia, sometimes in the middle of the 19th century, so

Speaker 6:          21:07          hundreds of now I could go visit. It's not that I've purchased. What's that?

Speaker 5:          21:15          They? Of course, they always. They nominate someone to represent them and they paid for the people. They introduced reforms. They paid for dedication of people. One of the first countries to introduce a bonus free educational educational on a statewide basis. So yeah, we'll try to develop it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          21:38          So it, it existed at that point in your, you said your father was the first one to move here. What, why? What changed is, was it around the time of the war or whatever?

Speaker 5:          21:48          Of course it, what? Basically the family lived on the huge estates, what is now the Czech Republic and all the palace in Vienna, whole summer states in Australia still. Uh, but then, uh, when, uh, Hitler, uh, took over Australia, well, didn't know what would happen with lifting and when the German troops marched into Austria by a father who was not yet during prince, his, his great uncle was married to a Jewish, a barrow nes family was very much anti Nazi for

Speaker 6:          22:37          see what the married to a baron. It's probably not best friends.

Speaker 5:          22:44          The randy prints flat to Czechoslovakia over the boulder. And my father drove his car, met the German troops marching towards a Vienna and try to stabilize it here. Yeah. Luckily he succeeded that, uh, we were not the next. There was a small, uh, there was a small attempt of a coup d'etat he unleashed when Nazi party, uh, when my father, I think in 1938 just before the outbreak of World War Two, the small, not Nazi party by the support of some Nazi people outside, I seem to governor have to roll and fall back or southern Germany support that. They tried to make a mark on the dots like the march on Rome, but to do cheer. Wow. Was a bad copy. Bold boat. Yeah. But then the people heard about it stuff because you couldn't keep it secret. Uh, so people came together. The farmers at that time, you know, with all the instruments there, hydrocodone forks and all the lawsuits on this around the country. Wow. I failed. Fascinating.

Speaker 3:          24:11          Your father was, was here and he established what exists today, essentially.

Speaker 5:          24:16          That's right when the reigning princes came to visit before they build a villa up here. Uh, but they came with settlement. It was only built in the second half of the 19th century when the first came to visit. Uh, but then the people wanted to have the costal, uh, which was before a museum adapted so that it will be residents or three prints and this is where we are and that's where we are

Speaker 1:          24:49          now. Most people think that Lichtenstein just became rich because of that low taxes and their secret banking laws. But this couldn't be further from reality. Now, of course the financial sector does play a big role here, but in fact the industrial sector is the biggest economic power in Lichtenstein. Have you heard of the company Hilti or Ivr called Viva dense? Well, if you haven't heard of that latter one, the next time you go into the dentist, have a look at the brands of tools they use, most likely they were made in Lichtenstein

Speaker 7:          25:19          to hitting system of the company that is still in the Buckingham Palace. I, I'm guessing that they updated it from this version already, but yes, the Buckingham Palace is heated by a heating system out of leakage Stein.

Speaker 5:          25:30          So we were, we were kind of talking and we, we spoke with other people as well about the employment situation in licked strikes. It's about 40,000 people in the country, but a lot of people come from around two to work here kind of as a commute. Right.

Speaker 7:          25:45          Lichtenstein actually has more. I'm working places. Then we have inhabitants. So we have roughly 38,000 inhabitants and 39,000 chops. That means we are heavily dependent on commuters that come into the country each day. I think it's about 20,000 people that come here each day. And what are these people typically doing? Um, most of them work in the industries in like a 40 biggest companies like Hilti, like the evil Claude or the to some crooked presta

Speaker 3:          26:16          related to the economy of Lichtenstein. And you know, I appreciate the history. Things I didn't, didn't even know after doing the research role of this. Um, what, what kind of drove the change from the Agrarian Lichtenstein from I suppose, how it was before your father arrived in and set things up here to Lichtenstein as it is today because while it was at 60 or 70 years, it's, in a way, it's, that seems like a lot of time. It's and not a lot of time for such a dramatic transformation.

Speaker 5:          26:48          I think there are several factors which were important are one factor was already in the 19th century when one of my predecessors introduced a general schooling career, one of the first states to introduce it, I think worldwide a thing in Europe because on thought because it was a poor country relying on the subsidies of the reigning prints. So at least we should educate the people so they can find a job outside of Stan if they don't find one. Insight. One kept the uh, taxation as low as possible. So to attract business one was then able to make a way of Allah. The customers treat you with the Austin Hungarian Empire that opened up the big market before for the local market. Hopeless, small too small. So with access to this large market or one could attract a Swiss textile industry. Yeah, because it's a across the border, but next to it. But there was a free trade with that. Otherwise they would have had to pay taxes.

Speaker 3:          28:02          It's, I'm just thinking of the similarities with today, kind of how in the past it was, we're a very small country. We want to trade with Austria, Hungary, and now it's like European Union in a way, a similar thing. You have your small country and we, we saw a healthy, the tool manufacturers, the dental stuff, of course, a low taxation, which is something we'll discuss in a bit. People I think often have these, these notions where they're like, they think of something and they're like, why is the place rich and Switzerland rather than the Lichtenstein as an example, low taxes. Right. But the reality is that it's often more than that, whether it's education of an education.

Speaker 5:          28:42          Yeah. And then also access to the markets. Yeah. If you don't have access to market. We couldn't even feed our own people. They were dependent on subsidies, better any prints, and of course it became better. Result really was fine with anger an empire and then after it collapsed. Luckily we got the same three d with Switzerland and I was able to push through thanks to the Eric Democracy, the European economic market, because there was a lot of resistance, a government and parliament and would not have gotten through that. But with direct democracy I was able to put it into to a popular vote. So I brought this.

Speaker 7:          29:28          We have several advantages here in Lichtenstein. One is that the taxes are not too high. The other is we are actually in the middle of Europe. Well, you've seen the distance since you're. You're everywhere within no time, right? We're staying in Switzerland while we're here in Lichtenstein, just over the border, as you were mentioning the people commuting from Austria and Germany, so race in the middle. We are also located in two different economic areas at the same time, so we have very easy access to the Swiss economic area and. But we're also part of the European economic area. Right, right next door to the EU, right next door to Switzerland. And we have both. We have contracts that makes it very easy. So if you like, for example, if you have an insurance company and it is based in Lichtenstein, you just need one office to work in Switzerland and in the EU. Well if you don't have it in Lichtenstein and then you need two separate offices,

Speaker 3:          30:45          I think that the removal of the secret banking that was who was here before. Do you think that. Do you think that affected Lichtenstein's economy much?

Speaker 5:          30:55          What it reduced for short terms a tax income against my more pessimistic look at it, I was very much in favor of opening it up because it exposes so much criticism of those banks or the financial industry. They recovered after two, three years perhaps also because they always said, oh, we're not going to be able to apportion this begging secrecy, which was introduced sometime before world war two, but Swiss and so on. So that that's changing though. You will have really two, two, if you want to survive in the long term as a bank or in the financial industry, you will have to offer good service for people who are willing to pay also that taxes in their home country. I think that's another thing that

Speaker 3:          31:58          that I picked up on was with these smaller states, you can really focus on, you know, instead of like you say, the reality is this is the way the world's going. People need to be open with their finances. This is how it's going to, how it's going to be, and then you could switch to a focus on let's do really good banking. Let's be really excellent banks. Let's not be generic. Giant Bank won't pick up the phone on Saturday morning, so you, that's be really good at this. Which is important. Do you think that's another one of the reasons why you know Lichtenstein is an economy has done so well because you can focus on doing things really rather than.

Speaker 5:          32:41          I think so, yes. I think it was the education system. It was low taxation. It was the realization that you would only be able to survive in a small, a small country in an economy with no whole market. You had to compete on the world markets to survive and nobody's going to protect you. The government cannot afford to support one of our larger manufacturing companies that we read. We just, then we would have to raise taxes and there will be immediately, uh, uh, uh, an initiative but the people in the popular vote. Why, why should we pay more taxes to support Mr Archbold, Mr Hill, Mr Mayor, Mr. whatever Mueller.

Speaker 3:          33:34          This is why like your system, because I feel this sometimes happens in other countries. Maybe my is. We didn't really get to say it's like A. Yeah, we, um, we, we just gave them loads of money because they were in trouble. Um, Le Pen, trump, UKIP. Why now do you, do you have an opinion on why? Why do you think this is happening now?

Speaker 5:          33:56          We see changes in the whole system of indirect democracy. People get more detached. Everything has become more complicated. You have globalization. There's not so much possibility to decide only for your state. All that makes people very unhappy and therefore populism easy solutions that people never really had looked much and why this law or that law like Switzerland or here, there was also in Switzerland, populist movements to certain degree on, on immigration, but that quietened down when it will solve more or less and here divorce, but not much and that I think is something that has somehow tried me for quite some time. Those states who are, in my opinion to certainly over centralized an ultra filling anymore the duties which are expected from the people and that creates populism and, and, and easy. So you and things like this and I think I've seen a lot of easy solutions. The appeal of easy solution, is it a solution? And very often they're catastrophists. Yes.

Speaker 3:          35:22          Narrowly avoided sometimes. Do you think increasing globalization, you know, maybe really is going to lead to more of this. Do you think this is something we're going to see continue? Do you think this is

Speaker 5:          35:38          kind of a something we're going to see fade away as people perhaps realize that, you know, once we've elected a populous, they're not all they're cracked up to be, it's, I don't think it's going to fade away because globalization is going to increase, uh, you really think you have to adapt to this new situation and really know their ordination state and social state told the people that we are going to produce heaven here on earth and that doesn't turn out like that. And so there's resentment on that and people have the feeling that the people up there, the adult contact anymore with us, they're detached, they're just looking for their own position, they own money and that creates this kind of populism. And uh, and that's, I think, a danger for democracy and that worries me. That's one of the reasons why I wrote my book. I just want to say it's been a real pleasure to, to ask you this. Have you given me your thoughts and everything. It's been a pleasure. It was an interesting discussion for me. Tall glass. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          37:03          Now, as we often say here, official policy of not everything is perfect and despite the success of Lichtenstein's model, there are still many questions.
