Speaker 1:          00:00          Here's a quick question and by now you know the rules, please don't google it or wikipedia it's or whatever and the question is what do you know about Armenia? What do you really know about this remote country located in the caucus's region out? Because Armenia has some very interesting traits. For example, it was the first Christian country in all of history. It's a chess well power I didn't even has its own alphabet is another thing that you might not know about. This country inside of the country is not really sure how to say this, but essentially there's another country in that. This country is the self constituted republic of odd sack, formerly known as an Al Gore Cara back. You owe that rights we're talking about, it's a republic that isn't recognized by any other country in the world but which proclaimed its independence in 1991 and has its own governments' parliaments constitution and even its own armed forces. You'll see except for a passport with which they can travel the world. They have everything of course, this curious republic citizens, I'm sort of [inaudible]. They all have an Armenian passports because this country is a close ally of Armenia.

Speaker 1:          01:17          You see, during the Soviet period at this territory was an odd blast and autonomous province of the asthma, Shani, Soviet socialist republic, but when the Soviet Union collapsed it and the government decided that it wanted to belong to Armenia, which led to a long four year water caused thousands of death.

Speaker 2:          01:37          Bye.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Oh, interesting. Side note here. Have you ever noticed in history how many wars have happened simply over eight tiny piece of lambs? Let's stay on topic for today. Maybe that's something we'll talk about in the future. Now, most would agree that Armenia has absolutely everything required to dazzle a politics. Addicts as of course, everything required for us to talk about it right here on visual politic. One comes re inside another one and recent war in 2016 a huge diaspora, a democratic revolution, and even the potential to be a headache for Mr Vladimir Putin himself. So listen up.

Speaker 2:          02:16          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:20          with no see access, a location surrounded by huge mountains and less than 3 million inhabitants, I believe you are, that we can call Armenia a pretty remote place.

Speaker 2:          02:32          Okay. If

Speaker 1:          02:33          we had to briefly describe this country, we would say that it's not far off from the typical Hollywood portrayal of the former Soviet republic. Of course, they want to like Hollywood. They don't have a rebel military, and they certainly don't have a desire to return to communism. But the truth is that this country has many, many problems. See, Armenia gained its independence in September of 1991 and today, 27 years later, unemployment surpasses 20% one in every three citizens' lives in poverty. Public debt has multiplied by four in the last decade alone, infrastructure is falling apart, and on top of all of that, they have a serious emigration. Yes, you heard that, right? Emigration, you see, it's estimated that there are about 12 million Armenians around the world, but only 3 million of them actually live in Armenia. Therefore, we're talking about one of the largest diasporas in the entire world and only one out of every five Armenians lives in Armenia itself, not, it wasn't astonishing enough. Every year on average, 40,000 Armenians leave the country and in many cases they simply never return. Worst of all, things do not seem to be improving jack out, for example, the evolution of foreign investments in recent years,

Speaker 1:          03:57          but at this point you might be wondering, well, why are things going quite so badly? Well, div you at one of the reasons is certainly corruption ends. The huge amounts of power that oligarchs in the country possess. You See, in the last 20 years, the Republican Armenian party, Hey, theoretically sends a rise in pro market party. That's really just a huge club of oligarchs, has tons of the country's politics into a network of interests and privileges. Let's put it another way. For two entire decades, if you wanted to do business in Armenia joining this party, it was almost a mandatory step and if you were a foreign up dropping by wasn't a bad idea or either. However, just hold on a moment here, because in April of 2018 Armenian says, well, enough is enough. And do you know what they did? Well, they held a revolution in the streets. Check this out.

Speaker 2:          05:01          The revolution.

Speaker 1:          05:05          10 disastrous. He has empowered after exhausting his maximum number of mandates, president's seg socks, young tried to copy Putin's strategy and get elected as prime minister

Speaker 1:          05:19          to do this. He proposed a reform that basically pasta president's main powers onto the prime minister. Say, what do you think it happens at this point? It's all we talking about a smart maneuver to stay in power or rape. Leighton's mockery to all Armenians. Well, the have you, uh, it was very, very clear to the people of this country. The presidents, he was laughing at them. He could rig the elections, uses power at will and that's big oligarchs use the government to get rich. But this, this was too much off to 10 years of presidents, segs, terrible managements. This was beyond the joke and the Armenians, they did not accept it. The 13th Nicole, passion young, a journalist and opposition deputy and the Armenian parliaments could lead a protest mobilization. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          06:12          Si.

Speaker 1:          06:13          But at the beginning, very few people join this protest, but in a matter of days, things changed. A great deal. On April the 16th for large groups of students join the protest and four days later on Friday, April the 20th the movement had already concentrated and Yara van, the country's capital with tens of thousands of people appearing.

Speaker 2:          06:31          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:34          The government's, which up until then had seen the demonstrations is a small nuisance, began to get rather nervous. What do you think they did at this point? Well, they did what? Tyron, Steve, they're rested the main leaders of these completely peaceful demonstrations, including their leader, Nicholas Passion Yan, they also announced that the police would disperse the protests rallies by force and without any consideration. Yeah. At this point, you might think that, well, that was the end of the movement, right? Well, in fact, no, just the opposite happens. It was the point of no return from that moment. More than 200,000 people in a country. A few of them, 3 million inhabitants took to the capitol streets, the country. It was paralyzed work centers, schools and universities. They all closed. The police faced with such a massive concentration of people. Well, they decided to do absolutely nothing. So all of this encouraged more and more people to join in a completely peaceful and really quite happy protest. Finally, Armenia citizens had stood up and said, enough's enough. The velvet revolution is underway. And what was the results?

Speaker 2:          07:53          Wow.

Speaker 1:          07:54          Pm on Monday, April the 23rd just 10 days after the protests began, the president announced his resignation. A few weeks later, our passion, Yann himself, the protests leader, a journalist too. In recent years, it's suffered an attempted attack and had been in prisons for confronting the governments had now been appointed prime minister. Yes. It was a pretty crazy few weeks from opponents of prisoner and from prison up to the governments. All in just a few days. Thing is why does society stabs up to demand freedom, democracy, and justice? It's kind of hard to stop them. I mean he now has a chance to change its course and to face the oligarchs and ends the widespread corruption that's been consuming the country.

Speaker 2:          08:36          We have

Speaker 3:          08:36          a new Armenia now where each investment will be protected and no investment will be threatened any longer and he called Pacinian. Tara for group is one of the largest companies in the sugar trade, but this company is forbidden to import sugar to Armenia. We can to allow them to do this as well as allow other companies and we will definitely it. There should be no

Speaker 1:          08:56          monopolies in Armenia. Nicole Pacinian, Armenian prime minister, let's hold on for just a moment because it's certainly not going to be easy for one because the Republican Party is still controls congress and it's representative of several ready status that they won't resign or make it easy for the new prime minister and that's an old old as if that wasn't enough apart from their own internal problems. Armenia as two other important challenges and to one of them is Vladimir Putin's, Russia, Russia and usury threats. Moscow has such a huge amount of control over Armenia is economy, defense and foreign policy. Many analysts speak openly about the kind of defacto occupation without giving any further and the Armenian city of [inaudible], the Russian army has right next to the Turkish border and important military base with more than 5,000 soldiers, Mig 29 aircrafts as 300 anti aircraft missile system. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:57          but it isn't just a military issue to a large extent. The country also depends on the remittances sentence cut by more than 2 million Armenians who are currently living in Russia. I in addition, the Russian giant is its main commercial partner and completely controls their energy supply. I mean, check this out. What does crude in Armenia is something unnatural? It is next to Iran, a major exporter of gas, but it imports it's gas from Siberia as a result of agreements that do little more than legalize Armenia's occupation. Indeed, under the terms of those accords, you're Yvonne can't make a deal with Tehran and less Moscow. Oh, agrees. Ruben [inaudible], the editor of the Russian service of the one in.am Internet portal. The fact is that so far Vladimir Putin has had very good relations with the government and do you all know that these kinds of revolutions, they don't exactly thrilled Pearson, so there's a warning on the table here.

Speaker 1:          10:50          Do not pay too much attention to the seductive calls of the European Union of the United States. Certainly the 5,000 Russian soldiers stationed in Armenia certainly help put this message from Moscow across buts. That is not all. There is also another huge threat here. Remember the republic of outs like that. I mentioned her right at the beginning of the video. Well sorts of a protectorate of Armenia in such way this Azerbaijan and considers it to be an occupied territory. Indeed, they've had no qualms about expressing their intention to reconquer it and tear. It must be said, the confrontations ons unusual. Amazon even relatively recently in 2016 hard confrontations took place that four days until Vladimir Putin demanded a ceasefire,

Speaker 1:          11:35          it will be asleep. The risk exists, especially because Azerbaijan has oil and gas that you, that means money. To give you an idea as a bit as John's military budget is as big as the Armenian governments in higher budgets. So if one day Russia decides to wash its hands, Armenia could certainly get into a lot of trouble. Anyway. That is how things stand in the country today. But now it's your turn.
