Speaker 1:          00:08          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Located between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. We could say Columbia is something like the entry and exit door of South America. You know what? Well this, this is Columbia, the long and it's cheerful beaches of Santa Marta. The lower he red desert, the inaccessible the teeth.capital of the leafy Colombian Amazon rain forest. Then there are the islands of San Andres and providence. Yeah, the coffee bells of Quinn Dio, cal drows and raise Eraldo and then there are of course the vibrant cities of Midean Kelly or baron Quia, and we can't forget about the historical and proud Carter he know or the Frantic Bogus,

Speaker 1:          00:46          Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:48          Very good. I'll be in the great capital city of the country that dear viewers with its candelaria and it's incredible museums of Golden Arch. We'll leave you absolutely speechless. Yes. We can't really be surprised that more and more travel companies are making Columbia a 100% must visit destination. Right. As you might've guessed this video, it's not going to be about tourism in Colombia. Not at all. It's politics that we do here at visual politic. I mean it's right there in the name.

Speaker 3:          01:16          May, 2018 Columbia will have its next presidential election and by August 7th whoever wind will have begun his new job. Juan Manuel Santos, the current president cannot run again as he has reached his two term limit.

Speaker 2:          01:31          Santos is tying is coming to an end with this video. We want to take a look ahead and to find out what kind of Columbia he is going to leave to his successor. We're going to have a look at the great things. Well, there's the not so great.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:46          Days. Columbia,

Speaker 2:          01:48          a gambling man, a great poker player and part of one of the most influential families in Colombia. This is Juan Manuel Santos.

Speaker 3:          01:56          Even his great uncle at the water though Santos was President of Columbia in the late thirties his family also owned a temple, the most influential newspaper in the country.

Speaker 2:          02:08          It's the very same. Juan Manuel Santos was for a long time. Deputy director ans a colonist apps, the newspaper. What do we are trying to say is that this family, they've never lacked influence money or power.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Sorry,

Speaker 2:          02:25          off to two times the 7th of August, 2017 marks the end of his time as president. And to be honest, his level of popularity, it's pretty much shot rock in Boston. This is even after winning the Nobel Peace Prize due to the deal that he got with FARC. The latest poll numbers when we're making this video showed that 65 to 75% of Columbian people disapprove of his governance. So the question now is, how does the Nobel prize winning leader have such strong disapproval ratings from his own? Perhaps it has to do with this broken promise about

Speaker 3:          03:00          the peace deal with foc. Remember, he assured them that it was going to be the Colombian people and no one else. You were going to have the last word on the deal and well, let's just say that Santos forgot all about that. Columbia referendum voters reject peace, deal with bark, gorillas, Colombia, the FARC sign, new peace deal. This time skipping voters

Speaker 2:          03:22          bosses. Apart from all of this. If there is really something that can make an assumption low ratings, well, while I won't have to be via economy. Yep. During the last decade, this Pacific Kuma called Columbia, well, you know, it used to have quite strong grief and it even became one of the most thriving of the Latin American countries. However, lately things have been emailed a little bit difference that actually they've been really quite a lot different. I mean, have a look at this chart. Columbia is facing a situation of slow down, which is really much closer to what we'd call stagnation. The latest growth figures show a year on year increase of slightly above 1% and 2017 forecasts don't seem to be that much better at all

Speaker 3:          04:09          be as economic growth rate will be 1.5% in 2017 according to bb va research.

Speaker 2:          04:15          As you can see, this is really not a good figure, especially if we consider that most of the richest countries are growing at higher rates. The United States, Canada, Spain, Germany, UK, all of them will grow more than Columbia in 2017 as well. It's kind of supposed to be that when you're a poorer country you grow more. This is because of something that is called economic convergence. So well now the question has to become what's going on in Colombia and he blamed the situation on the fall of oil and commodity prices and you know in a way this is sort of rice, but there are some nuances that we do need to consider. Now, it is true that it, its climax in 2013 oil did represent more than 50% of all the country's exports. More than 30% of all foreign direct investments has more than 20% of public reserve.

Speaker 1:          05:08          But it's

Speaker 2:          05:08          also true that for many years, thanks to the high oil prices, the governance of Columbia has had more resources than it's ever happened before. Resources that could have been used to boost a productive and competitive economy unrelated to those original commodities. And this is something if at the Santos Administration seems to not really have done, perhaps this is because they've been dedicated. This is almost exclusively to that peace deal with fuck. Anyway, let's now have a look at what are the main weaknesses of the Colombian economy? Disastrous infrastructure. For years Columbia's been, I'll should we say it's almost a failed state in many areas. These are areas that were controlled by warlords, gorillas and militias and narchos. All of those things, so now imagine how difficult it would be to manage such a country ans build complex infrastructure there. But really the reality is that that's not the whole school,

Speaker 1:          06:05          Laurie.

Speaker 2:          06:10          The reality is that infrastructure has never been a major priority for any Colombian government and the results of this, it's pretty obvious. The infrastructure in Colombia, it's really, really bad today to describe Columbia is infrastructure that we can use. Really any other word, the dreadful, most of their paved roads, they're in a state of total disrepair as well. Was the result of all of this and do you pay close attention to this? Because while there's almost unbelievable

Speaker 1:          06:37          football

Speaker 2:          06:40          container within the country is twice as expensive as in Mexico or Bolivia and four times more expensive than in Argentina Gla or, and in fact the situation is so disastrous that free transport between the Colombian ports of, of interior around Bogota is three times more expensive than moving the same load from a rotterdam,

Speaker 1:          07:01          Frank Franklin.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Interestingly, there are some reports that claimed that sending a container from Carta Haina is a blue guitar costs three times more than sending it to Shanghai.

Speaker 1:          07:11          Hi,

Speaker 2:          07:17          so now you can probably imagine all of the effects that this has on supply costs, prices and the competitiveness of Colombian companies. According to a recent OACD report, Columbia is the third world's most expensive country from which to export containers after Venezuela and Russia. That's why Hahnemann well sent us decided in 2010 to make changing. This is top priority and it is true. That is government has just released the biggest infrastructure plan in the history of Columbia. A private co-funded plan, which under a concessionary system is actually pretty attractive.

Speaker 4:          07:56          Bye. [inaudible] must which three study? Yes.

Speaker 2:          08:07          This plan, it actually seems to be well designed bars after seven years. It's just a bit too late and it still comes with many problems. Is that the honest during his two terms, Santos achievements are really haven't been as good as he promised that they were going to be.

Speaker 1:          08:25          Your rocker C and taxes

Speaker 2:          08:29          both the World Economic Forum, I'm the world's bank, confirmed the Columbia is one of the countries with the highest taxes on companies in the wells, which is obviously something that doesn't help companies to grow and develop according to the paying taxes reports that every year price waterhouse coopers publishers, the total of all taxes, the declan via and the company has to pay is 69.8% of their pre tax port.

Speaker 2:          08:57          That's almost 70% which is significantly higher than in countries like Germany, Spain, the United States. To be honest, it's pretty insane. I think that's not even mentioning the bureaucracy, which has an almost equal level of pure insanity. Once they were really gonna have to make a video about the passion for bureaucracy. The last in America seems to have a book because it would be really long. We're not going to touch on it in today's video. It's just too huge of a topic. But what we can say is that on an average day in Columbia, 15 rules and three decrees are issued.

Speaker 1:          09:30          Okay?

Speaker 2:          09:30          Yes, really every single day, not just that, but according to research conducted by the University of last banner, more than 30% of the laws passed are useless. Tans just create costs for Colombian society. And so what is quantum mainwell Santos has done to solve all of these issues? Well, he's done almost nothing. In fact, he has made the situation even worse. Persistence, violence. It is true that many aspects where they to do security are improving in Colombia. The uptick in the tourism industry in the country is pretty good evidence of bass. In 2016 fundings, million tourists visited the country, which is twice the number from 2010 and almost 10 times the number from 2000 which is certainly not bad. However, despite this in many areas of the country, the situation, it's not really improving.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:26          Cording to the United Nations and the Colombian conflict analysis resource center, there is still violence in the most affected areas of the country. That is the FARC peace deal has not substantially improved the situation in these areas. For example, kept on growing and cocaine refining is at its absolute highest. Me Just have a look at this chart,

Speaker 2:          10:51          so well now you might be wondering how is it possible that violence levels and the production of illicit substances has not been reduced since the governments deal with fuck? Well that's because responding to all the marketing from the government's Indwell, the violence by FARC was huge. It actually represents it less than 10% of the nation's total violence and more over the areas that FARC have left have not been occupied by government institutions but by other Naco ends, militia groups, some of them even having a mutual agreement with fog after all the business, it's still very attractive. Now the peace deal left and many things up in the APP and that's why these so called peace dividends is not giving results as big as the government promised. Now to be fair though, not everything has been totally bad under Santos, his presidency, the best of the centers administration, we have to admit that Juan Manuel Santos has achieved some pretty good things is government actually brought Columbia to the Pacific alliance and this is another thing going to talk about in an upcoming video, so do not forget to subscribe, hit that button below. Of course it's foreign agenda. It has been a great strength of his government. Columbia today is more open to the world than it ever has been before, so that poverty has been reduced considerably and the country has attracted lots of foreign investment.

Speaker 1:          12:14          Bye.

Speaker 2:          12:15          Despite all of this, our impression here at visual politic isn't the arrival of a new government can really be a positive turning point for Columbia. When one manual Santos took office, the country seemed to be ready to tackle a real process of transformation and their oil resources meds that they have the ability to pay for us. However, this as of yes, it simply hasn't been achieved. In fact, it's kind of been the opposite. Santos leaves a weak economic Columbia and many more future prospects than current realities. So now we'd love to know your opinion. What do you think the future of Columbia will be? How would you rate Santos as a president?
