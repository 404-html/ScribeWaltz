Speaker 1:          00:07          Here's the question sheet and Google the answer. Imagine that you have to buy a house. Where would be cheaper? Barcelona or Miami if you need a clear. Let me tell you that both cities have more or less the same population. If we consider the metropolitan area, both cities have beaches and to very touristy.

Speaker 1:          00:27          In addition, the average salary in Miami is almost twice the one in Barcelona and the unemployment rate is much, much lower. Having said all of that many, many things that my logic Barcelona would be cheaper than Miami. Well, if you're thinking that you're actually wrong, heightens in Miami are 15 percent cheaper than those in Barcelona. If you were buying a house in Spain is truly an impossible mission, but I know what you may be thinking right now. Houses. Well, they're expensive everywhere, right? Well, yeah, you are actually right. House prices are rising in almost every country and this is especially surprising if we consider that the trend is quite the opposite for other good. We've said it already on this channel like a thousand times. Humanity is just doing better. We've practically eradicated malnutrition old around the world. Our standard of living is much higher than that of our grandparents and this is pretty much do among other things to the fact that the products we consume, they're getting cheaper. For instance, just 30 years ago, our parents would have to save an average month salary to fly from London to Berlin. Nowadays, that's just history. That's housing is the only elements that hasn't become more accessible. Indeed. It's becoming almost prohibitively expensive in many parts of the world. In this video, we're going to focus on Spain, but many of the things we're going to review because happen in almost any country because the question that we're asking ourselves today is why is it so damn expensive to buy a house and can we do anything to solve this? Well, we are going to answer these questions today, but first let's dive into the history

Speaker 1:          02:08          law of the land. Once the first and most important thing we need to build a house, well, that would of course be the lambs that were going to build it on rice. Well, in that aspect, Spain has the perfect geography. We're talking about a huge, relatively flat country with many unpopulated areas. Are the countries, for example, the Netherlands, do you have the very real problem that they high population density? However, Spain has plenty of space for all of its inhabitants.

Speaker 2:          02:40          No. Having a

Speaker 1:          02:40          piece of land doesn't necessarily mean we can use it to build houses. For example, in 2011 40 percent of the land in the capital, Madrid was considered not urbanized. This means that the city council limits construction in these territories. In other cities such as Malaga, this percentage even rises to more than 70

Speaker 3:          03:00          percent. You might be wondering, well, why all of a sudden many lands where you can't build up the onset of this lies in municipal services. You see when you build in a residential area, you need sewers, electricity, new bus lines, and of course things like garbage collection and say, well, who's responsible for all of these costs? The city councils, that is every.

Speaker 2:          03:22          Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:26          If a construction company proposes a housing development on the outskirts of Madrid, it doesn't manage to sell them all. Every local will have to pay for a ghost areas. Urban services

Speaker 1:          03:37          due to all of this town councils have decided to control every single detail of where and how that municipality you can extend in Spain. This is done through a legal instruments known as the urban ordination plans. These are maps that every city will publishes every 10 years specifying the areas in which someone can build, because hold on a second, maybe you're Spanish and you're watching this video from Spain. Now I know what you might be thinking. Isn't land supposed to be liberalized in Spain in 1997, Jose, Maria, as Sonos governments put out a law that's involved in theory land liberalization. This means that in theory all of the countries lands became developable. That is essentially it is suitable for construction. Suddenly every Spanish city group and lots of residential areas emerged. This was the beginning of the housing bubble butts. As we've mentioned many times the devil in the details take. Now, we said that the urban ordination plans determine the areas one can build on, but that's not the entire picture hat. It also sets the conditions for building. Okay, imagine we're requesting a permit from the Barcelona City Council to build a block of flats on a plot that we own. Well, the city council will say absolutely no problem, but you can only build 20 homes or 15 or maybe even just

Speaker 4:          05:00          10.

Speaker 1:          05:03          They need to see the problem. Even if construction is allowed, housing supply is still highly

Speaker 3:          05:08          restricted and by the way, this also explains many of Spain's corruption cases. Most of the scandals that have been discovered in recent years were revealed because developer, it was bing a town planning a council so that instead of getting a permit for 10 houses, they'd get one for twice as many.

Speaker 1:          05:25          In other words, the construction sector has a larger and more perverse incentive to essentially invest in bribes than any other sex at like for example, incurred in the 20th century. Can you guess the least productive sector of the economy, as you might imagine it is indeed construction. We're talking about a world where it's all just. You find a project actually being built by its due date, and this isn't just limited to Spain. They give you an idea. The new apple offices in Silicon Valley, they were completed two years later than expected and has an extra cost of $2,000,000,000 and the same happens with almost every house built,

Speaker 2:          06:12          right?

Speaker 3:          06:14          One survey of British architects found that 60 percent of their buildings were late

Speaker 1:          06:19          and so well. Now you might be wondering, well pointed these things out, but as whole the answer essentially lies in a lack of innovation. Of course, houses today a much more modern. They have better insulation that a heating systems, but the way in which they're built is pretty much the same as it was 50 years ago. Any economic sector, it's just much more advanced. For example, a car factory 60 years ago, it looks nothing like a car factory today. Most of the jobs, our grandparents health have simply been replaced by computer programs, machines and robots. What's the results of this? Well, nowadays a call has many more features and is cheaper to make than it was 60 years ago. Thanks to that. Now almost every family can afford one or even two. However, if we saw a construction project from the 19 sixties with barely notice any difference with one done today at all, same builders, same grains, I mean construction companies have barely invested at all in innovation and it's understandable. If we take, they're extremely low profit margins into accounts. You

Speaker 3:          07:22          heard that, right? Housing developer can expect a profit margin of two to five percent. Of course, if we're talking about millions of euros, two percent is more than enough to make the company's owner rich.

Speaker 5:          07:35          You gotta hit that, Ya know,

Speaker 3:          07:45          barely allows them to reinvest in other things such as research and development. And if this weren't enough, there are very few incentives to replace workers in machines

Speaker 1:          07:54          and if this was not enough, there are very few incentives to replace workers with machines here. Unlike other economic sectors, working in construction requires initial training as well. This leads to a greater concentration of low skills. We can summarize everything like this. There's a restricted land supply which makes property prices rise, and then there's a long and expensive and unpredictable construction process. Now, what's the result of all of this? Both homes in Spain have become prohibitively expensive. However, almost 80 percent of Spaniards, they've managed to own their own home. So the question is now, well, how is this possible? Well, let's dive into that money for everyone. That's a basic principle in economics. Things all worth what someone is willing to pay for them. For example, if a foreign flat in a normal neighborhood of Madrid is worth more than 300,000 years, it's because someone can afford to pay more than 300,000 euros. That how can there be so many people who can pay so much? I mean, isn't Spain's supposed to be in a financial crisis? Didn't we say that the average salary in Spain is less than 2000 euros a month?

Speaker 2:          09:12          Okay,

Speaker 1:          09:13          well, dear viewer, the answer lies of course in the banks, 300,000 euros is a true fortune for someone earning an average salary. Bart, if one pays all that money in comfortable installments over many, many years, it'd be a bit easier. And so how many years do you think we're talking about here? Ten years. Twenty years? Well, the truth is that we're talking about a lot, lot longer,

Speaker 3:          09:40          40 year mortgages in exclusive and conditional product for young people.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Forty years is an incredible amounts of time and it's really not uncommon in Spain to find people. You have these 40 year mortgages and some may say to all of this, what's really the sense in that? Imagine you're a bank and you grounds a couple, a 40 year loan, a thousand different things can happen in four decades, which means they might not be able to return the money. So where's the business for the bank here? How can the bank risk so much when grunting alone? Oh, well, the answer to that is in the central

Speaker 2:          10:12          thank you.

Speaker 3:          10:15          Be to keep printing billions of euros to prop up the eurozone until 2019. You really did hear that Rice. Nowadays, Europe is producing more money

Speaker 1:          10:25          than ever. However, Europe does have a relatively low inflation.

Speaker 2:          10:29          Great.

Speaker 1:          10:33          In another visual politic video, we did explain that when central banks print bills prices, they tend to go up. However, in Europe the opposite happens so well, why is this? Well, that's because all of that newly printed money that goes directly to the banks and the banks he was at for. Well, of course that was the loan.

Speaker 3:          10:54          That explains why even with relatively low salaries, most Spaniards are willing to pay real fortunes to own a house and what's worse prices continue to rise unabated. It will always be someone willing to originate or take out a 40 year mortgage.

Speaker 1:          11:10          In other words, all the factors point to the fact that this in the long term housing will become more and more expensive and that explains things like this.

Speaker 2:          11:20          Housing profitability

Speaker 3:          11:22          rises as an investment.

Speaker 1:          11:24          This means that along with the people who buy an apartment to live in is there are people who buy them as an investments and other words central banks inflate to hens. Municipalities restrict supply conclusion of all of this. Houses are becoming more expensive every single day and at this point I just want to take the time to thank Miguel and health on seconds, architectural studies for helping us understand all the details of the world of construction in and planning in Spain. Gal and how Fonseca is one of the greatest experts of sustainable architecture in Spain. You can find more details about him in the video description below

Speaker 1:          12:01          and well now it's time to turn to you. How do you think this problem should be solved? Do you think we should restrict bank mortgages? What about released the land in order to be able to build more? What kind of policies do you think would solve this problem?
