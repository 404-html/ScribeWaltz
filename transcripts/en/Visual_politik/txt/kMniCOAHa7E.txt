Speaker 1:          00:00          Argentina is an interesting case. Busy at the end of the 19th century. It was the richest country on the planet that is, it was Richard than the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Even when it was at the peak of the British empire,

Speaker 2:          00:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:24          middle of the 20th century, the country had already gone down a few positions, but it still remains one of the 10 richest and most prosperous countries in the world today. However, it's not even in the top 60 so how can a country suffer such a dramatic decline? Well, it might have something to do with the fact that since roughly speaking, the 1940s Argentina has known only to political movements, military and Peronas. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:00          yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Previous video here on the visual politic, we talked about the origins of Coronas, and we saw how Juan Domingo Peron came to power wash. His political approach wasn't how in 1955 he was overthrown by a new coo to tops. So the question is, well, what happens after this key? What happened to Argentina and how did [inaudible] involve? And perhaps most importantly, what does it mean? What is Peruna Islam Today? Well, listen, up in 1955 there were two cute atars against Quando Quango Peron's government in the fast, which proved unsuccessful. The Argentine navy bombarded the Plaza de Mayo in an attempt to, to end the president's life.

Speaker 2:          01:48          Yup.

Speaker 3:          01:53          That

Speaker 1:          01:57          it's just a few months later in September of 1955 it did not fail.

Speaker 2:          02:02          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:02          Got It. You'd be [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:17          hello

Speaker 1:          02:17          to go into exile first in Venezuela, then in Panama, and then it's finally and Francisco Franco, Spain. When the new government's arrived proclaiming the liberating revolution, brandism was literally outlawed everything. Absolutely. Everything that had to do with the [inaudible] image, the marches, the symbols that Hims, the names, everything was prohibited by the military government.

Speaker 4:          02:41          No. I then feed off and even said, Addis [inaudible] America. [inaudible] is your list.

Speaker 2:          02:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:50          In just two years, this liberating revolution dismantled every prunus structure. Before having new elections, they even changed the constitution again, so reestablish the one from 1853 although they did introduce 14 articles which introduced almost all the social and interventionists measures that Peron had established.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:10          The truth is that history is hard to forget. It's by forbidding everything that had to do with Peronas and in a way the military governments turns him into a kind of, yeah. The fact is that in the following democratic elections in 1958 presidents are, Toro from DC was elected a politician who tried to turn Argentina her rounds and reopening it to the wells, which is precisely what made the country one of the richest in the world.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Hold on a moment because despite the good economic results, he had to face the peroneus unions and the military. I had of course already gotten used to playing with Argentina, however they wished because, well, once the military boots is used, it's very hard to suppress the temptation to use it again and again. The fact is that a few years later, the military demanded the resignation of the democratic presidents from DC as well. Why did they do this? Well, simply because they felt like us. I mean, it's pretty much reason enough. Ans when the president didn't accept this, well, what do you think the Argentine military did? Well, yes. You probably guessed right. They used weapons to depose and then imprison him. Yeah. The fact is the little by little, the atmosphere became increasingly tense and Peroneus themselves while mobilizing more and more demanding Peron's return. There were elections and they are very fragile. Our governments. What was the result of this? The military made another cute to Ravi this time. They gave it a rather poetic name. In this case they called us the origins Hein Revolution led by the guy your seeing here. That's a general Juan Carlos [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          04:50          Why?

Speaker 1:          05:03          And this was the beginning of very tense period because in addition to the dictatorship, the cold war was going on. Man's in Latin America. That generally meant struggles between leftist guerrillas and military governments, Argentina, they were no exception.

Speaker 5:          05:20          I think we and we can

Speaker 1:          05:20          save it in the 1960s seventies and eighties work terrible, terrible years, are pretty much all of Latin America and the following year is gorilla and terrorist groups began to emerge throughout Argentina, such as the Monta narrows, he revolutionary people's army, the people's armed forces, and check this out because Peron himself had taken his strategic turns to the left and was now encouraging these types of movements or from his home in Madrid, which of course was located in Puerta to Herro, one of the most expensive areas of the Spanish capital. The fact is that between the bad economic situation and the attacks, that was such huge amount of discontent for the military regime was forced to call for elections in March of 1973 although they of course left per on out under the excuse that he didn't live in Argentina bugs. That's ultimately did it matter. And September of 1973 new elections were held cannes. This time Juan Domingo Peron was elected presidents with check this out, his wife Isabel Martinez dip around as vice president.

Speaker 2:          06:31          Yes.

Speaker 1:          06:35          It was simply easier that way. Everything stayed in the family, the president and vice president, the tandem one, them an overwhelming victory with approximately 60% of the vote. But hold on a moment because it wouldn't be that easy. Listen up the return. One thing needs to be clear if that is an unwritten law. In politics, opposition is one thing and governments are very different one and that law certainly applied to quantum domingo

Speaker 2:          07:17          or on

Speaker 1:          07:21          see as we mentioned before, during his time in exile, he became a point of reference for every opponent of the dictatorship. But if on the left and on the rise, but of course this friendship between the extremes once the dictatorship fell was doomed to fall not long after, and that the viewer is precisely what happens. And in a very violent, the situation got out of hands. The leftist guerrilla groups continue to attack. Civilians, politicians, businessmen, as well as the military per on was no longer enough. They once it's a popular revolution, well at least that's what they called it. And if we're in this government responded by promoting the creation. Listen to this, have a para military group known as the triple aim anticommunist Argentinian association. The results of all of this mixed was tension there, confrontations and disappearances, and if that wasn't enough, the economy also ends from bat much worse. So problems were done. It was becoming a bit of a nes, and it didn't last very long because on July, the first 1974 funds and being gay per on his days, they came to an end and he left behind a terrible legacy. In 1975 the war between Peronas, it's under a proneness to government, was at its peak, and it's the economic crisis led to a brutal devaluation that left the peso in tatters.

Speaker 1:          08:49          With this panorama, you can probably imagine followed a new queue to tar, and it was not just by anyone. The darkest periods in Argentine history began on March the 24th 1976 the military junta government rose to power leds by Jorge Rafaelle of the dealer who's period leading Argentina was characterized by the permanent violations of individual rights.

Speaker 3:          09:13          Cool. We've got got, he'd pick up when, I mean that I've had that board about patio there.

Speaker 1:          09:22          The military left behind terrible numbers. More than 10,000 disappeared and thousands and thousands more became political prisoners. But did you have just a moment here because if you think ism was dead at this time, well you're very, very wrong. A new ride.

Speaker 2:          09:42          Yes.

Speaker 1:          09:44          After the dark and terrible periods of the military junta democracy returned to Argentina in 1983

Speaker 2:          09:57          five

Speaker 1:          10:01          at that time the brain is sweat dismantled and a new president was elected, Raul Alfonsin who the elgin dines most remember for the hyperinflation that occurred under his rule.

Speaker 2:          10:11          Oh trust me, don't thank God. And I said, what do you got?

Speaker 1:          10:31          Inflation soared to over 80% per month, which is pretty much what happens when you just run the money printing machines. And on top of that, both the military again and the Peroneus do unions decided to make this government inoperable? The strikes were absolutely endless. So once they were reorganized, you know, what's the Peroneus returns this time under the leadership of Carlos Soul men m and surprise, the new president's off to two terrible first years, took a 180 degree turn and to knowledge to policies that were completely unexpected for a peroneus governments. He brought a wave of privatizations, liberalized the economy and trade and even achieved a monetary stability by introducing the ones a one peso US dollar exchange rate. Martin investments began to arrive, trade grew, and as the Arjun tines where again prospering and feeling like they could rise up in the world again, bars and my friend's president, Menem did not do one thing and it's president macri take note here because he did not reduce public spending on the country. Public spending absolutely skyrocketed and so did corruption and waste of all varieties. I'm awesome. More since things were going smoothly, the reforms, they won't complete it. Even Argentina with an overvalued currency, a huge public expenditure, many imports and a ton of debt

Speaker 1:          12:16          and you can probably guess what happened is in 1999 the opposition took over. It was too late. The crisis peaked in 2001 Argentina defaulted and the origin Argentines suffered. The famous Cora Alito under this situation in 2003 you gas disc corona returned to power. The brutus disability to wriggle out of the line of falls into blame. Others. It's actually pretty admirable. They've almost always been in government, but apparently they've never been to blame for anything. Do you know who came to power here? Yes. It would be the Coachnas proneness who has the same policies as always. Only this time, very much more inclined to the left.

Speaker 2:          12:54          Remember,

Speaker 1:          13:02          during the years and the Casa Rosada, the Argentine Whitehouse, could they restricted imports, multiplied public spending, inflation taxes and debt boss? Give you just a moment because before we finish the video today, we have one last question. It's a really important,

Speaker 2:          13:22          what

Speaker 1:          13:25          spout on Islam, what is Peronas it? How is it managed to be almost hegemonic in Argentina despite the fact that it sounded terrible results? These are the truly important questions. Well, the viewer, I think that taking history into accounts, we can say the personas in more than a political party is a movements with two essential pillars, excessive interventionism and public spending.

Speaker 6:          13:50          Amen.

Speaker 1:          13:58          The secrets of their political success has to do with this. Every time Argentina has a problem, the Peroneus promised more and more public spending all of course financed with the populist politicians favorite instrument, the bill printing machine under the excuse of political sovereignty, economic independence, and social justice. The three faces established by Juan Domingo Peron Peronas have ended up in making Argentina a country that is close to the wells that has longterm monstrous inflation and practically lives in permanent crisis. So the question really becomes, isn't it? Perhaps time to find another way. So now it's your turn from one to five. What is your degree of confidence in Argentina is future?
