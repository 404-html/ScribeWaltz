Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          Any of you have asked us for a video explaining what communism is all about, so well paired is if you have been following this channel for a while, you'll probably know that when not exactly on the communist side of the spectrum, but before having an opinion about something. It's important to be informed about this. Plus, at the end of this video, we're going to share some takeaways about mocks that just might surprise you. The Internet is full of trolls who will either sing marks his praises or hate on him without ever having read it.

Speaker 1:          00:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:39          it's why people ends up in leaving quite a lot of stereotypes about communism that's simply on true. Now, before I saw it, I will say that this is a summary of Friedrich Engels and column boxes ideas on communism only. We've only got 10 minutes, so it's going to be impossible to cover authors who came after or the politics of the Soviet Union. But with that out of the way, let's get started.

Speaker 1:          01:04          The first thing

Speaker 2:          01:04          you need to know that may surprise you is that mark's was eight materialist of thinker. That means that he thinks the main driver of social change is material goods. The foundation of Marxism is to determine which goods have more value than other goods, but it do be warns here that we are talking about value, not a balanced price. Price can be influenced by other things such as taxes or monopolies.

Speaker 2:          01:33          For Marx, the value with the good is measured by the work needed to manufacture it. So for an example, how much is a chair with it would be the sum of the carbons does working hours who put the chat together as well as the some of the working hours of the lumberjack. You cut down the tree as well as the some of the working hours of the blacksmith who made the nails that went into the chair and this goes on man's almonds on in summary, it's all the work of all the people who went in to making it as the chair. Don't forget this because it's very important in understanding the idea of capitalist exploitation and though this has nothing to do with working hours or worker's condition

Speaker 1:          02:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:16          it's the wealthier is this some under mocks? The welfare is the sum of all these people's work, right, but these people, they only get a share of the wealth of that they create. The rest is profit for the factories.

Speaker 1:          02:32          This one

Speaker 2:          02:32          needs that. If these people are working eight hours a day, they're only getting a fraction of that. Maybe the first three or four hours work. The other part, the part that the businessmen receives is cold substance.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Bye. Their produce

Speaker 2:          02:47          value. He's there for the exact expression of the expectation, the glory of the working force by the Capitol or the worker by the capitalist. So something you might be wondering how is it possible the business owner to exploit the workers so easily? Why on the workers getting the whole value that they're generating? The answer is because they don't have the tools required to take the raw materials and turn them into a finished product, a factory, a workshop, whatever. This is Marty. An economic jargon is called the means of production or capital means. In fact, this is why the person who owns these things is often called a capitalist. Now, despite what some people think marks has no problem. If you want to own a fancy car or a really expensive mobile phone, he just has a problem. If you want to own the means of production, this means having a company. But why is this a problem? Well, let's take a look.

Speaker 1:          03:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:42          [inaudible] of capitalism

Speaker 2:          03:45          now mocks divide society into two classes. On the one hand you have the capitalists, the bourgeoisie, and on the other hand you have the one that gives the pro to terry at the bourgeoisie own the production process and they exploit the workers. The workers are the ones who were doing the work and making the value, but they only get the bread crumbs from the bourgeoisie. Therefore, we have a confrontation or why you might have heard of a class struggle, and this is what Marx defines as the original sin of a market economy. And as you can clearly see, it has nothing to do with poverty or inequality. In fact, in Nordic countries where the difference between the wealthy and the poor is not so great, there is still capitalist exploitation as long as the means of production is in private hands. This is why [inaudible] doesn't just focus. His criticism was on capitalists, but also on Social Democrat

Speaker 1:          04:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          04:38          that'd be less systematic, but yet more practical of socialism dries to freeze any revolutionary wheel from the working class. Claiming it is not a political reform that will give them benefit, but only the modification of their material life conditions.

Speaker 2:          04:54          In summary, the working relations of capitalism are based on one group living off another group. This is what Marx calls the infrastructure of capitalism. Nevertheless, in order to make this work, the bourgeoisie, you need some sort of secret weapon to keep that supremacy. That's why they create a government. They create laws, they create even religion. This is what Marx calls at the superstructure, also known as a cultural hegemony. So what is Marxists solution to end all of this injustice?

Speaker 3:          05:25          Girls Revolution.

Speaker 2:          05:26          Further Marx believes that capitalism is unsuspecting

Speaker 1:          05:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          05:33          claim that their goals can be only achieved by the violin over throat of every existence, social order.

Speaker 2:          05:40          In fact, he even predicts that the first countries to fall will be the biggest industrial nations specific green. He predicts the fall of the United Kingdom, which was the leading industrial nation of Islam,

Speaker 1:          05:50          right?

Speaker 3:          05:53          He's 14 their own destruction and their own undertaker. The proletariat

Speaker 2:          05:58          boss here is the most ironic part of the story. If you look at all the facts, the countries that have had marxists revolutions are things that never had an industrial revolution and never had a bourgeoisie. These are countries like Russia or China, which never had a capitalist system, at least how mark's defined it, those countries with advanced capitalism, it never even had a revolution. Maybe the only exceptions would be Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but these were cases where communism didn't come through a revolution, but by the USA army invading those

Speaker 1:          06:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:32          key question, the boxes. Philosophers wonder during the 20th century is where is the revolution? The marks promised us. This is a question that many people have tried to answer to philosophers that I would specifically recommend reading on this topic are yoga and the harbor mass and then turn to your grand scheme. They looked at human language as well as how humans perceive reality to see why we haven't had this revolution. Interestingly, this research has even been useful in possibly the least boxes thing you can imagine.

Speaker 1:          07:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:03          that is definitely something we are not going to address in this video, but we'll save it for a future video. If you're interested in learning how box relates to marketing, do let us know in the comments below. If you are interested in finding out more about this topic now, then you can check out a book written on the subjects, but unfortunately it's only in Spanish, but it is written by one of the hosts of the Spanish visual politic channel. Send your funds sacker but as I said, it's definitely something we'll consider addressing in a future video.

Speaker 1:          07:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:32          shed our opinion with you, but what do you think of Marx's theories? Do you think that they're still relevant in the world we live in today?
