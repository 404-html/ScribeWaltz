Speaker 1:          00:11          Question, can a poor country reasonably aspire to become a high income one within a few years? Second question, how much time would they really need? And third question, how would they do it? These are some of the most common questions that you send us pill on this channel. We've seen in various videos how several countries have managed to change that luck. It's become locomotive swells of you. In this video I want to tell you about a very particular case. I want to tell you about Poland's because Poland's becoming something of a new Germany. Well, listen up. Here's a question for you, Andy. As always, please do not google. Which do you think is the city with the most Polish inhabitants, Warsaw and Krakow? Well, wrong. Actually it would be Chicago. 2 million Polish people live in Chicago. Yes. We own really not getting here.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Give you a. it's not been easy for polls. During the Second World War, Poland was the country that suffered the most. No less than one. Out of every five poles, that's almost 6 million people, which is the conservative estimate by the way, lost their lives. Then after that disaster, they endured 44 years of a communist governments who in addition to exerting an enormous amount of political repression also left them as a poor country in 1989 when the system came to an end, Poland's per capita income was between three and five times smaller than that of developed countries such as Italy, France, or the United Kingdom, but just hold on a second because things they've really changed. Portland's a country located halfway between Paris and Moscow and has $40 million inhabitants completely changed its model and since they've done this, a very economy has grown by over four percent every year.

Speaker 2:          02:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:15          All right, so now you might be thinking, did I just put too much emphasis on four percent a year because it doesn't sound that impressive. This is. Especially if you compare it to the pretty crazy growth rates that you can see in the Asian tigers for present kind of sounds like a drake, right? Well folks, if you are thinking that you are missing a couple of important things,

Speaker 2:          02:32          details

Speaker 1:          02:38          is that we're talking about almost 25 years of uninterrupted economic growth here. Not even the great crisis of 2008 and 2009 really affected this country at all. We can say the ponens moving kind of like a giant cargo ship. It's not the fastest ship on the water for sure, but it has moved and incredible distance another way young Polish people have pretty much no idea what an economic crisis is like.

Speaker 1:          03:12          The second detail is also very important to it because I'm like, what happens with the Asian Tigers? Poland's has had this huge growth while being a consolidated democracy and by the way that really kind of dispels and important myth here and that's that countries need a strong hands in order to grow. Well anyway, thanks to this grief, Poland has had an amazing 25 years. This country has gone from having average salaries are between 10 to 15,000 American dollars per month to having a panic capita income taking into accounts each country's price difference. This in 2018 will be higher than that of Greece, Portugal and every Latin American country, and the reality is it's not really that far behind Spain or Italy either. Then goes into this point, I think there's a question that we really need to answer. How did they achieve this? Well, listen up because that's what we're going to talk about in today's video. The end of an era, 34 years from 1945 to 1989, the socialist state of the People's Republic of Ireland, the satellite country at the Soviet Union was in power by the way, to give you an idea of how great Moscow's control was, it said that when in 1950, the Polish leader Bolus Law Barrett show Joseph Stalin himself a draft of the future Polish constitution, that the leader of the Soviet Union made dozens of corrections by hands, which of course were taken into account anyway. The Polish regime was one of the least harsh in the entire Soviet orbit.

Speaker 1:          04:49          For example, most of the lands wasn't collectivize. The Catholic Church was allowed to function with relative freedom cans. Even though political repression was high, it wasn't quite as intense as it was another country. Even though of course, as in any good socialist country, the state controlled almost everything, and in 1989, it's economy completely shattered. Now, thanks to all these small freedoms or real political opposition emerge, lead among others by lack of Valenzuela, the leader of the Independent Solidarity Union, the thirst for union of all eastern European country. Thanks to this. When the Soviet Union's power began to crumble, Poland's became the first country in eastern Europe to set its political transition in motion to completely abandon communism and so on. June the fourth, 19, 89, the first relatively free elections were held, and with that it was no turning back

Speaker 2:          05:50          shock therapy. Just a few months

Speaker 1:          05:54          after the first elections in September of 19 nine, the minister of Finance, less egg bow Sarah of it sets a plan on the table to shred the entire communist fabric and to replace it with a capitalist model. Three months later, this shock therapy as it's been known as launched,

Speaker 3:          06:10          exerted a liberal program called shock therapy. The idea was either the patient improves or dies from one day to the next. Everything was liberalized in a very rigid and centralized economy in which prices and needs had nothing to do with reality. He called it the lunar economy. Everything was fiction or pvh. Nia Oshinsky, Polish diplomat.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Suddenly everything changed.

Speaker 2:          06:32          Sure.

Speaker 1:          06:36          Prices were liberalized. Controls were lifted, people were able to set up private businesses. They stopped printing money. The economy began to open up to the world and the plan was launched to privatized public enterprises within a short time, not even the polls could recognize Poland's. Also, the government's had a very clear idea about the future. Ponant needed to get as far away from Russia as possible and strengthen its ties with the rest of Europe and the United States. So what was the result of all of this? Well, a few years later, they joined the European Union and NATO. Now, what model do you think the country has followed since

Speaker 3:          07:23          change? Of course,

Speaker 1:          07:27          I've already told you plenty of times the world is getting better. Poverty is decreasing and countries are getting rich yet, but despite this belonging to the club of rich countries is still a difficult mission. Even so, everything points to Poland achieving this within a very short amount of time. Dev, this country is becoming eastern Europe's Germany. See, Poland has become an industrial power house, flooded with multinationals and like in Germany, it's smaller. Medium sized companies have begun to cross the border. The results I'll since 1999, it's foreign trade has multiplied by more than 25 Polish exports amount to almost $200,000,000,000 per year, which represents more than 40 percent of the country's GDP, which is a seriously high. Simply explains why Polish roads off full of trucks. Now you must be wondering, well, how are they achieving all of this? What on earth is the key to their success? Well, Dave, you are taking notes at the Polish recipe has four main ingredient to the establishment of institutions that attract a lot of foreign investments, legal, security, property rights, ease of setting up companies and competition. For example, 14 special economic zones have been created where any interested company can gain many advantages. Second, strict controls of public accounts. Homelands. Government is one of the most healthy in the European Union. Public debt, for example, is barely 50 percent of the GDP and almost as importantly since 1989, they have been set on fighting inflation, so no printing bills to finance the government. Basically the opposite of countries like Argentina,

Speaker 1:          09:28          first quality education, Yep. You heard that rise. Poland has managed to make their educational system work and they've done this without wasting huge amounts of money. It's rate of university students is higher than the average of the European Union. Nine out of 10 young people complete secondary education, and according to international studies, the Polish education system is one of the 10 best, not just in Europe, but in the whole world and forth. There's moderate taxes. For example, companies are taxed 19 percent while smaller companies are taxed 15 and income tax breaks down into two brackets, 18 percent for the first 24,032 percent for the rest. And in addition, because Poland is a fairly conservative country, families have even more advantages. So if we take into account both personal taxes and pension payments, Poland is the fourth one, cd country where families pay less direct taxes,

Speaker 4:          10:34          right?

Speaker 1:          10:35          So it's with these four ingredients that Poland has managed to become eastern Europe's Gemini and exports and industrial power with a healthy governments can take quality of life that just keeps on growing. The best proof of this is perhaps that within a few years the great power of the east has gone from being a country of immigrants to the country of immigrants from a country of immigrants to a country of immigrants. In recent years, if something has characterized the Polish economy, it's the simple availability of work. Unemployment is approaching six percent and many companies are beginning to have a problem finding workers. Initially, foreign companies would only look for highly experienced employees with titles. Now they take everyone and give them a month training if necessary. Roman and Lake entrepreneur and of course if companies need a lot of workers and can't find them, I'll wages go up. The average gross salary in the first quarter of 2018 was seven point one percent higher than in the same period. In 2017. Average gross salary exceeds $1,400 per month with central statistics, office of Poland. And you know what this situation has led to, well, first, many young poles who until recently left on master Richie European Union countries deciding to stay.

Speaker 1:          11:57          I'm second. In recent years, more than 2 million Ukrainians have settled in Poland, especially young people looking for better opportunities than the ones they could find in their country of origin. This means the Poland now has more people arriving than leaving.

Speaker 1:          12:15          Now, as we always say, visual politic. Not Everything is so great. Portland is facing quite a serious aging problem. Ends the Lore Justice Party, a very nationalist and very conservative party, won every recent election and now controls the country some of their decisions. Of course, the European Union threatened Poland's with sanctions and even suspends their rights as a member, but that's something we're going to address in a future video now. It's your time.
