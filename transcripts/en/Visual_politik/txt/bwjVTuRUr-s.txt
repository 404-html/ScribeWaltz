Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:09          have you ever heard this phrase?

Speaker 1:          00:12          Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:15          Sounds pretty good, right? I mean, it's quite a proclamation, a call to an epic objective and appeal to the people's pride towards resistance. But truth is though, that over the years, this slogan has become one of the chance, the essential slogans of every protest, especially in Latin America and especially in protests and demonstrations of Marxist Leninist, Maoist and socialist movements of all kinds. Going back, one thing [inaudible] what about the get that'll regarding battle, because there aren't the 20th century, these types of chance, proclamations and slogans supported a huge number of groups and protest movements throughout Latin America. This happened to such an extent that in many cases, these epicondyle brave slogans, they had a far more terrible phenomenon of phenomenon that it became one of the most remarkable characteristics of the entire region, the gorillas,

Speaker 1:          01:05          [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:14          What does the gorilla phenomenon consist of and why did it emerge? I mean, how could gorillas have such an impact and so much power in, well, what's their situation like today? What are we going around? So all of those questions, and there's a video, but first a bit of history

Speaker 1:          01:29          come, hey,

Speaker 2:          01:37          the spark that ignited the flame is the 1960s the gorilla phenomenon is about to begin the Cuban revolution. It's just happens. And folks, we really can't talk about guerrillas in Latin America without us taking Cuba's roll into account.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Yep.

Speaker 2:          01:55          You heard that right? The Cuban revolution was a great source of inspiration for all kinds of anti imperialist, revolutionary and communist movements. Not only that, but over the years, Cuba say became the number one promoter of guerrilla groups in the entire region. Yeah. We could say that Cuba, it was quite a powerful station, that center.

Speaker 2:          02:15          The fact is that the myth of the Cuban Revolution was the main reason that thousands of young idealists, in many cases with good intentions helps 10 last in America into a Hornet's nest. How could they resist the exploits of the Great Command of Fidel Castro, the leader of that supposedly managed to get the revolution running with just 82 people. If he could do it, why could ends others? I mean, get the rifle boys. Let's crack on. Well, many of these young people, they clearly felt this quite fervently. You see, the truth is that the revolution managed to triumph to a great extent, is precisely because of the excessive violence and repression of the Cuban dictator, full henslow, Battista. These were accesses that got a good part of the army, including several officers who align with Castro.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Great.

Speaker 2:          03:02          And by the way, did you know that unlike what's commonly said to this heroic revolution, it didn't really have a clear ideological objective.

Speaker 1:          03:13          First,

Speaker 2:          03:14          in 1959 Fidel Castro, he never tired of repeating again and again to the Cuban people, among others. He wasn't a communist. Fidel himself, he said this, I know you're worried about whether or not were communists. I want to make this clear. We aren't communists. I'm not a communist, and neither is our movement. You, they'll Castro communities. And in a future video, we probably do need to talk about the Cuban revolution. So we'll do that at some point in the future. But folks, many, many members over the revolution, they were communists. However, it wasn't until two years after the revolutionary triumph in 1961 that Fidel declared himself a Marxist Leninist and proclaimed the socialist revolution.

Speaker 3:          04:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:02          We can ask ourselves two questions. What change in these two years and why is this important? Well, listen up

Speaker 1:          04:15          operation center

Speaker 2:          04:19          speak their Washington politicians never believed Fidel Castro statements denying communism. In fact, they saw this new regime in Havana is a danger during the cold war. That's how the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion attempt merged. At the same time, this was quite clear to the Soviet Union leaders. Cuba meant an incredible opportunity and mainly for three reasons.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:40          First, by allying with Cuba, they'd gain a very advantages geographical position to the United States. They would have a friendly territory and a military base just a few kilometers from the American maintenance. Second day, socialist Cuba would mean a new satellite stage. Thus reinforcing that position in international politics and third, Cuba. It could become the operations center to spread communism in the u s is so called back yard. That's Latin American.

Speaker 1:          05:04          Gotcha.

Speaker 2:          05:07          That way folks, that Soviet Union's chances of winning the Cold War, they absolutely grew stronger and you know what has we usually say here at visual politic so that we said and say it was done. The regime then led by Nikita Khrushchev concentrated on consolidating its relations with the new Castro I'd Cuba, and it was quite a strong focus from that very moment, Cuba became a center for training, financing, and supplying equipment and weapons for their revolutionary movements throughout the continents. That's how Havana became the biggest gorilla uprising promoter in Latin America. The duty of every revolutionary is to make the revolution. The second declaration of Havana, February 4th, 1962 the idea development by El Che was that a small group of activists could initiate a typical guerrilla war actions and blew up existing institutions to spread the flames of the socialist. And not just that, they also promoted a new strategy known as cultural Marxism.

Speaker 2:          06:02          This, by the way, it's still seen in many places. So what exactly does this strategy consistent of? Basically it's using education and culture app to help communist and revolutionary ideologies infiltrates society to this ends. The Cuban regime supported the creation of songs, poems, university writings into literary works of all kinds with a common characteristic. All of them were steeped in revolutionary ideology and among other things, extolled the gorilla figure. Take Education and culture, and the rest. We'll add on Antonio Gramsci. Now, if you want to know more about how Havana supported some of the most famous gorillas. Well, listen up

Speaker 4:          06:44          ties

Speaker 2:          06:48          the first operation, it happens in Nicaragua. Thanks to Moscow and Savannah's technical and military and economic support. The Revolutionary Leader Carlos Fon sacker amador, promoted the creation and organization of the Sandinista at National Liberation Front in 1961 if you've heard of it, that's probably because it's Daniel Ortega's movements. Who's the current tyrons presidents of Nicaragua about which we've already spoken in several videos here are visual politic. Yup. Let's go back to it.

Speaker 4:          07:15          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:16          In 1969 at Carlos Fonseca moved to Havana where he spent the next six years from that he organized the Sandinista Front. In 1975 he returns to Nicaragua to solve some leadership problems and unify the gorilla group. And although a year later, this revolutionary leader was assassinated in 1979 the Sandinista friends, they finally seized power.

Speaker 4:          07:38          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:38          The gorilla trained and financed and supported by Havana at triumphed, the model it worked. So why stop in 1980 a year after the Sandinista fronts triumph, the F M N, l, V, Pharaoh, Buddha, Marty France, fuck national liberation was founded in El Salvador with Fidel Castro himself as an intermediary. What's more of this group? It was founded in [inaudible] honor itself.

Speaker 1:          08:05          Wow.

Speaker 2:          08:05          With the support of the Cuban regime, along with that of the new Nicaraguan government and Moscow, of course, the f m n l started it's armed fight their training centers where the occasion in Cuba and Nicaragua, of course, it was those same countries, which provided them with weapons, supplies, equipment, and anything else. They need it.

Speaker 1:          08:25          No,

Speaker 2:          08:26          hold on for a moment. As you can imagine, the United States didn't just stand that they weren't willing to give Havana another victory, so they decided to support the Salvadoran government. Their results. 12 years of fighting that cost more than 75,000 deaths, thousands more missing, and an economic.

Speaker 2:          08:51          Now we can begin to understand the magnitude of the violence that has destroyed so much of this region. The fact is that on this occasion, the gorillas, they didn't achieve a revolution and after the peace agreement of 1990 they formed a political party. Does any of this party governs El Salvador runs? Of course, it hasn't hesitated to support Daniel Ortega's Nicaraguan regime, but don't think for a second that this situation has happened solely in Central America, not at all the southern countries. They also had that Shat South America also underwent a wave of revolutionary movements in facts throughout Latin America. More than a hundred hundred gorilla groups caused enormous damage. Almost all of them were encouraged and supported by Cuba in one way or another. That's certainly true for the most famous gorilla groups. FARC, the April 19th movement in Colombia, and it's the shining path in Peru,

Speaker 5:          09:43          Shining Path. Activists have been trained in Cuba, Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic. Manuel who law, former prime minster of Peru and statements to the bias newspaper in 1983

Speaker 2:          09:55          all you surprise now that the peace agreements between Fark and Juan Manuel Santos is Colombian government will be negotiated in. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          10:01          Vonda.

Speaker 2:          10:03          Of course these huge groups, true army is also had another fundamental support points and that's drug money. Yup. These groups ended up becoming drug traffickers business from which they obtained the enormous resources they needed to continue the fight. Awesome. Don't forget that Cuba also went into this business we told you about that. Here are visual politic in a recent video about Nahko politics in this region of the wells. Yes. The Cuban government even associated with Pablo Escobar himself and that's when it all, the last example of Cuban infiltration, we all know was in Venezuela and we've already seen how things are giving that.

Speaker 6:          10:42          Okay

Speaker 2:          10:43          folks, Cuba's influence on Latin American politics in the last 60 years has been terrible. Havana has played a major role in back and guerrilla groups and regimes that have done absolutely no good for Latin America. Yeah, and I know nowadays some people still view these groups with a certain romanticism, but that really isn't mistake beyond the feets and the myths, the real story, unfortunately, it's terrible, but fortunately the gorillas are now at the lowest point in decades and that at least is good news. By the way. Many of the guerrilla groups, they weren't just Havana's faults. In many cases, they were the fault if a terribly extractive oligarchy that control to their country with an interest in nothing but maintaining that own privileges. This has also been one of the great evils of the region. So with this video, we can own fleet now better understand how so many guerrilla groups suddenly emerged in Latin America and why relations between Washington and Havana have traditionally been so bad. The story, it goes far beyond the missile crisis. So I really hope you enjoyed that video. If you did, please don't forget to subscribe for brand new videos. Also, don't forget to check it off.
