Speaker 1:          00:08          Totally before being fired on twitter at Secretary of state, rex Tillerson, the former US diplomat, has concluded his first tour of Latin America was the first official trip a senior officer from the trump administration had taken to the region. Though a few months ago in the summer of 2017 the vice president's himself, Mike Pence had his own Latin American talk in which he visited Panama, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile. I think we all know that the relationship between the United States and Latin America is very, very, should we say special. And by special we mean not very good. And I'm not just saying this because there are about 60 million Hispanics living in the United States, but also because of historical precedents, commercial ties, and many, many security issues. Without going any further, one out of every four US trade dollars ends up in this region. However, the vice presidents and the former secretary of state's toilets left in many with the feeling in the eyes of the trump administration. Latin America is more of a nuisance than an opportunity, and this might actually be softening the blow. Considering everything that trump has said since he announced that he would run four presidents, when Mexico sends its people,

Speaker 2:          01:38          well, they're not sending their best no more, no more naps. Alan Bray Dead Pedelec when we're going to build the wall, we have no choice. We have no choice

Speaker 1:          01:51          to describe the relationship between the United States and Latin America today. We could say that the United States is kind of like that friend who demands loads of things from you. But when the situations reversed, they won't do anything for you. A pretty good example of this is the pretty surreal Mike Pence store. It's all that had practically no objectives and to which the vice president seemed to be more concerned with trying to prevent the insignificant commercial relations between Chile and North Korea, or maybe trying to get the origin zines to buy pork from his State, Indiana. He didn't seem to have much of a focus on actual international relations between the United States and Latin America. Uh, I come from an agricultural state in the United States. I was governor of the state of Indiana before I became vice president. Uh, and um, I know the, uh, the quality of American pork.

Speaker 3:          02:57          You

Speaker 1:          02:57          know, it was China, Xi Jinping's China. Well, they're on the lookouts. So in the video today, we're going to see what he wants. What does Donald Trump expects from mass in America and also, well, what's happening with China. But first, let's look back at the history America for North Americans,

Speaker 1:          03:22          1823, the then president of the United States, James Monroe, launched what would later be known as the Monroe Doctrine America for the Americans or they, with time, this is become more like America for the North Americans see this doctrine, this policy defended the claim that the European states had no right to intervene in American affairs or in the countries that were becoming independent at the time from Spain. At that time, the U S was protecting Latin America and defending non-intervention, which sounds pretty good, right? Well, just wait a moment here because that is certainly a problem. Well, this doctrine led Washington's do practically everything in Latin America. We're a region that has since become known as the u s his back yard. Oh yes. Since James Monro launched this perspective, the United States has set up, governments has overthrown, governments, has financed gorillas, has financed armies, has bought politicians, has negotiated with drug traffickers, has managed to legitimize q to task and has committed many more actions aimed at depending on the time period, either at fighting communism or defending other interests such as some big oil sector multinational now. Yes, of course. Some good things have also been done, especially in recent years when the more, let's say opaque relations gave way to a strategy from Washington that focused more on resolving internal conflict.

Speaker 3:          04:54          Yes.

Speaker 1:          04:57          Was the case for example with Bill Clinton's Columbia plan or George Bush is trade promotion strategy, which led him to sign no less than 10 new free trade agreements with Latin American countries and to even propose for all of America to become a large free trade area. They even say relations between Latin America and the United States. They've always been very peculiar. You see, due to the Monroe doctrine, Washington has always felt like a legal guardian who can decide what's right, what's wrong, what's advisable, and Watson not advisable. However, the results haven't been very positive.

Speaker 3:          05:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:43          is it over again now since Donald Trump entered the white house. So let's see what the presidents of the United States of Latin America wants, what he expects and what we can expect.

Speaker 3:          05:58          What does Donald Trump want

Speaker 1:          06:02          now is not going to surprise anyone watching this video that Donald Trump is not exactly in Latin America's best friend who seemingly has very little concern for the region except Cuba, Venezuela and above all, well Mexico. In fact, trump has so little interest in Latin America that one year into his presidency at the time of making this video, he still hasn't appointed someone for the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hispanic Affairs. This is the person specifically responsible for diplomacy with Latin America and it's quite unusual that it hasn't yet appointed anyone to this position. That is not to see that his lack of interest hasn't made the region something of a play thing for him. Nor does it mean that he doesn't expect anything from them. Well, I, let me, let me explain this. Trump's first year has been marked with insults to Mexico, mostly due to his obsession with building that wall. Oh, and he's also threatened to Columbia, which is something we're going to get to in a moment. It may be through reimbursement, but one way or the other, Mexico will pay for the world.

Speaker 4:          07:04          That wall, build that wall, build that wall, build that wall, build that wall, build that wall, build that wall, build that wall.

Speaker 1:          07:15          I love the Mexican people. I have such a great relationship to make sure I hire thousands people. The Rich Mexicans, they're great people. Friends of mine, they buy my apartments. Ah, well how about some more examples? Now listen to this. In 2017 as we saw here on visual politics, trump moved away from Obama's openness towards Cuba without really proposing any sort of alternative. Also back in the worst customs of Western diplomacy in Latin America. He legitimized and supported the very suspicious reelection of one Orlando Hernandez in Honduras and most recently in 2018 is government decided to suspend these so called temporary protected status for Nicaragua and Honduran Haitian and above all Salvadoran immigrants. And listen because with this decision, 200,000 immigrants from El Salvador. Yes, 200,000 we'll have to leave the United States or simply become illegal immigrants. We had hoped that if we worked hard, paid our taxes and didn't get in trouble, will you be allowed to stay?

Speaker 1:          08:17          Veronica lacunas 39 a Salvadoran who has two children born in the United States and these are just a few examples. The list is really rather long. Perhaps that is why trump's popularity in the region is so, so low and when we say so, so low, we really mean it is just totally on the floor. I mean check it out. In 2017 Gallup asked Lassen American citizens for their opinion on president trump. Only 16% had a positive opinion. The folks, here's an important question. The question that we really need to ask ourselves is, does all this offense does all this poking in the, I mean that trump doesn't want anything from Latin America and the answer that is not a tall, his government is demanding several things from the regions, countries, especially the following three unconditional support for his foreign policy, including his policy on Venezuela, seconds for people to renounce or curb China's influence and third for them to take the blame for everything. Either by paying for the wall or by assuming more responsibilities in the fight against drug trafficking. Now, okay. Except for China in the world, the other demands could really be taken as actually being pretty reasonable. Do you know what the real problem is

Speaker 3:          09:33          here is

Speaker 1:          09:40          the trump administration never put any alternatives on the table. They don't seem very willing to give anything in return and they do everything under the, you're either with me or against me approach. And the truth is that if we want Latin America to change, evolve to prosper, it needs support and it needs opportunities. Like for example, more trade opportunities. That was another republican president. George Bush has precise strategy and the results were actually pretty good, but okay. Now you might be thinking, well, come on assignment. Surely trump has also proposed some positive things, right. Well, I really think to answer that question, we need to see how trump is treating the u s is best allies in the room.

Speaker 3:          10:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:25          brands

Speaker 3:          10:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:29          you can say without fear of being wrong, but Colombia, Honduras and Mexico have traditionally been, the u s is best allies in Latin America and you know what? With trump in the White House, it's not really helping very much. Check out the statements that trump made by rex tillerson was on tour trying to strengthen ties with the Latin America. These countries are not our friends. We think there our friends and we sent the massive aid and I won't mention names right now. We send them massive aid and they're pouring drugs into our country and they're laughing at us. Donald Trump, yes, trump. He doesn't give out any names, but there's little doubt. He was referring to Mexico, Colombia, Honduras, and brew in Mexico. He mentioned the wall. He mentioned the Nafta renegotiation. There have been constant attacks since trump announced his candidacy and do you know how people feel about trump in Mexico? Will, according to polls, it's 1.6 points out of 10 does also take a look now at Columbia, the country that by far has historically had the best relationship with the u s yeah, it might surprise you, but Columbia was actually the only Latin American country that sent troops to the Korean War. It also supported the United States and the 2003 invasion of Iraq and this country's policies. It's pretty much always aligned with Washington's interests. These have been created policies towards Cuba. China.

Speaker 3:          11:50          Wow. Well,

Speaker 1:          11:51          not even that's prevented from threatened ms country by considering it noncooperative with the fulfillment of international requirements in the fight against drug trafficking. This is something that could have a serious economic and political consequences. It isn't only treating an ally who's trying to solve the problem in a rude way. It's also a great mistake. He's sending a toxic message to the rest of the region. Even if you do what the u s asks, if they disagree with part of your strategy, they will act against you. Adam Isaacson coordinator up a Washington Office for Latin American affairs. Yes, it is true. The coca production has rebounded in Columbia and that the country hasn't been able to beat the drug trafficking that's threatening the country that has suffered the most from the war on drugs, threatening the only country that has managed to improve the situation. As I mean on top of that, he's doing it without proposing any alternative.

Speaker 1:          12:38          We've lost. Our best leaders are best journalists, are best judges, are best police in the war on drugs. Juan Manuel Santos, President of Columbia and is regarding Honduras and other great ally. What we've already told you here on visual politic about Juan Orlando Hernandez is very probable q and even in Argentina, a country that is rapidly changing something that Washington should logically acts upon. Well, they're not even acting then. Trump demands a lot from Latin America, but he really isn't willing to give much in return, not even to the United States, his best friends in the region, and China knows it.

Speaker 3:          13:16          Right?

Speaker 1:          13:19          Does pursuit,

Speaker 3:          13:22          okay.

Speaker 1:          13:23          China and the Chinese influence in the region is becoming a great obsession for the United States. Rex tillerson himself use the monroe doctrine to see that the United States has the right to block the interference of another power in America. But the question is, who gave the United States government that power in the first place? Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people. Rex tillerson allow me to explain this. Latin American countries have all the rights in the wells to seek other alliances, other markets, and other investments. And if those are Chinese, so the u s department of State should ask itself is how is it possible that Xi Jingping has visited the region more times in the last five years? Then the presidents of the United States, both Obama and trump

Speaker 3:          14:13          hold it.

Speaker 1:          14:14          China is willing to promote trade agreements and investments while trump is determines to punish Mexico, build walls, and restricts trade. A great example of this is the shutting down of the TPP, the largest trade agreements in history, which includes among other countries, Mexico, Peru, and Chile. See in the last Latin American and Caribbean states community meeting, China announced it would invest $250 billion in the region in the next decade. If the United States wants to maintain its power and its influence and continue to determine the political agenda, perhaps it should include looking after Latin America's interests in its political strategy, but now it's your turn.
