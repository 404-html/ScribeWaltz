Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          00:07          Venezuelan, as long game of thrones, we all want to know how it's going to ends, but at the same time we all know that we're going to be disappointed with the ending and this is exactly what are we going to be talking about today. Many of you have the same question in mind. How can the Venezuelan crisis and yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:28          we are talking about one of the biggest financial and humanitarian catastrophes in modern history in just 10 years they've gone from exporting oil to exporting refugees, but you already knew this. We've got several videos here on visual politic that cover this very issue. Of course, Venezuela is not the only country that has gone completely bankrupt. You also have the example of Nicaragua during the 1980s Nicaragua suffered from hyperinflation, scarcity of resources and extreme poverty as well, but in that case there was a clear alternative to power and it was easy to figure out what could happen there.

Speaker 2:          01:09          Venezuela instead is a big time mystery. Think about it. The Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro is up against the wall. As we said in this video. He even came up with his own cryptocurrency, the petro as a desperate attempt to get some foreign currency. If things keep going this way, he won't even have the money to pay the army. That keeps them empower. But this is not the worst problem. The real mystery of oven is wheeler is who is the alternative is they're really somebody who can substitute Maduro's rule, somebody with enough political capital to change things in this country and it's hard to say. So far summary, it is almost impossible to understand is the current political situation in Venezuela. And then this is why we wanted to talk to one of the world's largest experts in political transitions and you might wonder, well, who are we talking about here in a story in from a think tank and economist maybe? Well, we've got someone way better if I'm headed up was the finance minister of the Czech Republic during the first years after the fall of communism. He is one of the architects of the Czech Republic as it exists today, but this is not the end of the story. After having a remarkable political career, he started a business in South America. This means he knows this region as well as the palm of his hands. And with that said, let me introduce you to him.

Speaker 3:          02:37          Hello to all the visual poetic subscribers. All right, Simon, it's just impossible to imagine what could actually happen in ministry.

Speaker 1:          02:50          But

Speaker 3:          02:50          today we are going to draw three different or things show scenarios based on the recent history. So today's question is what can happen

Speaker 2:          02:59          in Venezuela? What potential scenarios can we foresee in this country? We're going to answer these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Correct

Speaker 2:          03:13          way out. Remember this name [inaudible] Slav. Javiel few people have had more influence on the history of a country than him. He must lizard be achieved. Yeah, it looks basically the Czech Republic. We know today the Czech Republic Web, I happen to live is what it is. Thanks to Vat, Slav Harwell and believe me, this is a big success story for a democratic transition. While other countries like Russia or Ukraine are still poor and unequal societies, the Czech Republic is prosperous, modern. And surprisingly egalitarian, they have low unemployment, a thriving middle class and it's the political rights of any other European country that well, how did they get?

Speaker 1:          03:56          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          04:03          until the year 1,989 checks lift the mosquito control government under the dictatorship of good stuff. Gustafason things like going abroad on vacation or forbidden or very difficult. If you wanted to rent a house or flat, you will need a special permits is with achy years.

Speaker 1:          04:23          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:25          Countries like bullet this fine. Having to communist regime David A. Little bit more open in effect manage checks even though it's trying to cross the Polish border so they could buy books. It pigeon in Czechoslovakia. It's time

Speaker 2:          04:39          nonetheless. Everything changed at the end of the 1980s

Speaker 3:          04:43          you, us though we never had the hyperinflation to heaven. Banish valid today. We did suffer scar seats. Did you want to buy a car? You had to have faith for years onto the state. Urgh factory would send your basic things like bananas but a luxury. It was impossible to find in most of the shops, maybe with exception of Christmas. The same happened with most of the fruits and vegetables, meats at many different other products

Speaker 2:          05:16          add to this. The fact that the Soviet Union couldn't send money to that allies anymore. So with no foreign support in the bankrupt economy, it's normal to have all kinds of protests. Of course, that first police suppress the protests against hossack. Raul,

Speaker 3:          05:29          of course, on the first stage, Balistreri brands, the protest a cane Zulu sat through. But what happens when all of a sudden you have more than 250,000 people in the streets of Brac? You gotta be crazy to start shooting quarter of million beads.

Speaker 2:          05:52          Nicolas Maduro, the Czechoslovakia and government understood that the best thing they could do with step down from power in a peaceful fashion, thanks to this Gustaf who sank it got his golden retirement and the check revolution was known as the velvet revolution because no blood was spilled. Nonetheless, as I said at the beginning, the key to this process was the prominent figure of Vaslav Harville. He was a famous writer back then, and so he managed to capitalize on all of the political unrest.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Sure.

Speaker 2:          06:22          And love will overcome lies and hate.

Speaker 3:          06:25          True Fuss. Love Harvard Bachelor. Hello, we'll slot schooler known before and with all the tribulation came up, but he had all the elements to become a good leader.

Speaker 2:          06:35          The question now is, is that any Venezuelan vaults love Harwell, maybe somebody we don't know that could emerge as a charismatic leader able to change everything. The answer is, unfortunately that we don't know and this is why we should talk about the more pessimistic scenario manian way out. What happens when a dictator doesn't want to leave power, even if the situation is getting out of hand. I'm telling you right now, it's nothing good. We've said it before here. A visual politic, despite how it looks, being an authoritarian ruler is a risky job.

Speaker 3:          07:11          Glass Churches, school is the best proof of this. You know, choking. Get both of them. The most brutal dictators we ever had.

Speaker 1:          07:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          07:34          I like Nicolas Maduro equal ass jokes. He didn't even care about pretending to organize elections. It was a system based on the cult of personality,

Speaker 2:          07:43          but you know when the economy goes south, even Europe's most authoritarians dictator has problems. Just like the rest of the communist countries. At the end of the 1980s Romania was at the edge of bankruptcy in some regions. They even had kids with malnutrition. Nonetheless, on December the 25th 1989 after giving a massive speech, the citizens went from clapping their hands to booing him in a matter of seconds. Days later, the Romanian equivalent of Kim Jong Uhmm was executed by his people.

Speaker 1:          08:14          Aye.

Speaker 3:          08:29          Beyond nuts talking about a revolution against the regime. He was not even killed by county humanist activists. In fact, vouchers school was executed by the members of his own party. It was kind of injuring Gudetama, the moderate faction of the Romanian Communist Party do to control of the Romanian government.

Speaker 2:          08:49          In the case of Venezuela, this good be a faction of his own governments or the army. Of course, it doesn't have to finish the execution of anybody. They could just kick him out of the country and you could end up living in a mansion and any other nation that would accept him. It wouldn't be the first time this has happened and it certainly won't be the last but just like in Romania, the changes in government would it be pure lip service, different faces but at the same values, the same policies although perhaps a little more moderate.

Speaker 3:          09:16          Well at this school year to do these Romania, he's not a special example of the transition but at least now we have a stable carpentry with some economic movement and growth and the reason I was extreme poverty anymore and there are opportunities in the for of future form

Speaker 2:          09:37          and I do now have to make a a serious and important decides. I want to be really clear about this. We're not wishing any personal harm on Nicolas Maduro or anyone from his government here are visual politic. We would never advocate for any kind of violence in this video. We're simply exploring potential scenarios that might or might not happen based on previous occurrences and that really is all that said. This Romanian way out doesn't seem likely to happen either. That is why we will focus on the latest possible scenario. Something that might sound at surreal, but everything seems to be possible in fairness way

Speaker 2:          10:17          a country for sale that Chinese way out. In this other video, we explained to you why China is the only strong ally left of Venezuela. The truth is that China has lens more than $60 billion to Madurai as governments. Much of this credit comes in what we call oil loans. There's means China gives money to Venezuela and Venezuela instead of giving back. Hard currency gives oil barrels, and this makes sense, right? If there was something abundance in this country, that would certainly be it's dinosaur juice. In fact, they have the world's biggest reserves, so it seems to be a pretty good deal for the Douro. Right? Well, that is a problem here because as you know, the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA has a big crisis too. It is more expensive to drill and extract oil in Venezuela than in any other country, including Norway and Canada. This explains why p Dvsa can no longer extract that own resources. This company is producing of just 43% of their capacity and it's getting lower and lower.

Speaker 3:          11:25          Oh, many Chinese investors are losing their patients. Don't forget, we are not only talking about [inaudible] being government here. There are many private companies involved here, companies that both have an Israeli in debt bonds or firms that hidden stake on of an Israelian industry. This is why we can find use languages

Speaker 2:          11:47          trying to see no peck, sue's Venezuela in sign of fraying relations. So the question now, the real question is what would happen in Venezuela if they can't give back those Chinese loans? Well, a default is unlikely. China is paying for the military and the police of Maduro. This means that at any moment they could simply shut down the government. So what could they do instead? Well, they could seize pdv essay properties and these might have viewers are the crown jewels of this coming,

Speaker 1:          12:17          trey,

Speaker 3:          12:22          Brian, you bet. We are saying, but it is a board of managers could do the necessary font so the company can go back to work normally.

Speaker 2:          12:31          Okay? Today if you DVSA assets are worth $230 billion, Maduro owes Xi Jingping more than $60 billion. In other words, Beijing could be entitled to seize a forth of PTV essays, assets, and don't forget that pdv essay is the biggest, if not the only company in Venezuela. Don't forget here that their dinosaur juice is 97% of their export, say only lean. PDV I say is sort of the same as owning Venezuela as a whole.

Speaker 3:          13:02          Well, I didn't bring simple, Oh, this would be good for good use for veneers, but it would immobilize because Maduro's government. Yeah, the words, it would be like selling Jehovah mcconnachie to the Chinese universities.

Speaker 2:          13:19          Okay. All right, so I know what you're all thinking right now. You're probably thinking, come on Simon, this is science fiction. It can't actually happen. Well, let me tell you that there are already signs that something like this could happen. Just look at the news published in Shane Choir News, as you probably guessed by the name shake. One News is a Chinese news sites that follows Tszujing pings views have a look at this.

Speaker 2:          13:46          Judo creates Venezuela's first petro special economic zone. Anytime China wants to do big business with a poorer country, the first thing they do is create a special economic zone, an area with special laws based on Chinese regulations and low taxes for business. But in this case, this could even go further. We're not talking about investing in a country or doing business. We are talking about buying the backbone of the Bolivarian Revolution here. Without pd Vsa, Maduro is like a hip hop artist without the bling bling chains. So if you can control the economy of the country, including the way that it gets its finances, couldn't we say that you've sort of already bought it? Well, this is what could end up happening in Venezuela. It will be one of the first times in history where our whole nation is sold.

Speaker 1:          14:35          Perfect. Again,

Speaker 2:          14:42          this is really hard to conceive, but as I've already said, everything is possible in Venezuela, but now, well it's your 10 which of these three scenarios is more to happen or do you think we'll see a mixture of all of them? These won't leave your answer in the comments section below.
