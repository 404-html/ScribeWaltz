Speaker 1:          00:08          In the last few decades, Israel has become one of the most important technological powers in the world and they're using it with a little more than 8 million inhabitants. This country has more than 4,000 tech companies, Cisco, paypal, Google, facebook, apple and Intel are only some of the many companies that develop new products in Israel. How did such a small island study island country become one of the world's innovation leaders? Well, we're going to answer that question. In today's

Speaker 2:          00:33          video

Speaker 1:          00:39          is one of the most controversial countries in the world ends in truth. It's pretty difficult to talk about it without having to revert a was religion and various political conflicts. However, in this video we're going to try it and we're going to try and shed some lights on a very different side of this country because they. You are. In the last few decades, Israel has become one of the world's greatest technological powers, and this is something pretty surprising. As we mentioned, Israel has over 4,000 tech based companies and ace of the largest 500 companies in the wells have subsidiaries here oriented towards research and innovation. In fact, Tel Aviv right off to silicon valley is the most important technological center in the world may seem impossible given its size. Israel is the country in the world with the third most companies listed on the Nasdaq. This is only behind is the United States and China.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Israel.

Speaker 1:          01:31          More companies are listed on this market than Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and the Netherlands all put together. So how about some specific examples? Well, here, they all, at the time of this video going out, most of the next iphone is hardware is being developed in Israel. Further, many of Google's innovations are made in Israel. Bands Intel, the world's leader in microchips who's most of its success to the innovations of it's Israeli subsidiary, which by the way has 11,000 workers and is one of the largest companies in the entire country and leaving Microsoft has been considered a semi Israeli radiation.

Speaker 3:          02:03          Funny. It is a hub of innovation with top notch computer science, academic institutes and revolutionary technologies.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Hey Belt, IBM, Cisco, Amazon, facebook. These are the companies that we use everyday who's technology relies a lot on r and d that is done in Israel. This actually makes up more than 12 percent of its national GDP and half of its exports. Alright, so now you might be wondering how did they achieved such success? Now, cultural factors are usually considered here, but today we want to focus on three political keys that were essential in this process.

Speaker 3:          02:41          Use My,

Speaker 1:          02:43          the 19 eighties in Israel are remembered as a terrible decade, especially from the economic perspective. Back then the country was going through a tough crisis. Inflation between 1980 and 1985 exceeded 100 percent every year. Deficits and public debts were an almost unbearable financial burden on the economy in general. People felt handcuffed due to excessive state intervention. To a large extent, Israel was very dependent on the help coming from different parts of the wells and even though the situation started to stabilize by the end of the eighties, right at that time, there was a massive arrival of Jewish people from different parts of the Soviet Union in very little time. 800,000 new people arrived in the country that now don't forget to put some perspective on this number in relative terms that would be like 70 million immigrants arriving in the United States and now the question for Israel was fairly clear, how could they generate jobs for so many people in such a depressed economy? Israel's only option was to reinvent itself.

Speaker 1:          03:43          The government tried to encourage the new canvas to create companies with subsidies that would promote the work of on trapping nurse, but they seen realize that this method didn't results in very prosperous companies. Immigrants who had no experience in management and they lacked commercial knowledge and they rarely got any financing. I mean, after all, he would want to invest their money in a turbulent country like Israel. And this is when the government realized that the key was to pass on attracting international venture capital that isn't money used for new ideas and new companies. In order to do so, they came up with the Osmo program, thanks to yours map. The government created 10 funds of venture capital and allocated $100, million dollars to be used under these conditions. Each Fund's capable of levying 12 million private investors would receive 8 million in public investments. In exchange the government would keep 40 percent of the property, but in case the investment was successful, the inventus could get these shares from the government just by giving the government's money back with the small interest rate, so in 10 years, all the funds that came to Israel at that time, lazy about 15 million billion dollar which will invested into local companies.

Speaker 1:          04:47          So if things worked well, the profits would be mainly for the investors and if things didn't work so well, the government, which Sharon the losses. Now, this might seem unfair, but the truth is that the public investment was relatively small lands. Also the government expected to get the losses back from the new taxes generated by these new companies and all of the jobs that they would create. The idea was to fire things up and then continue to reap the ongoing benefits. Since then, most public programs in Israel have followed this same system and the truth is the results. They couldn't have been any better. International money started to arrive. There was funding for almost any idea, and in the first eight years alone, the number of funds rose from 20 to 513. As a result, Israel today has one of the best ecosystems fall entrepreneurial capital in the world and according to the last one, cd data and the investment available for new companies exceeds $150 per person per year. To make a comparison of that figure. In Spain, it's only about three point $5, which is a solid 40 times less. The key in this process is that venture capital doesn't just bring money with this money also comes expertise and contacts

Speaker 2:          05:58          immigration

Speaker 1:          06:01          that Israel is the country which has bet on immigration. The next one out of every three citizens has been born abroad. Hands nine out of 10 are either immigrants or the children or the grandchildren of immigrants. This is an impressive migratory number that explains the growth of its population from 800,000 inhabitants in 1948, more than 8 million today. In this latest round of immigration, nearly 50 French Jews arrived at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, so in little more than 60 years, the population has multiplied by 10. Israel is in fact say political and historical exception because their founding documents, so to speak, it's constitution expresses the need to have an open integration policy. Let's examine the law of return, which is still enforced today and was created in 1950. Three Jew has the right to come to this country as an older law of return. Article One, and I don't get this wrong, this is not a minor issue. Immigration has contributed to the economic miracle as much as any other facts that no, no matter what populous politicians say, whose aim is often just to get votes. The wealthiest nations on usually the ones with more immigrants among other reasons, it's usually because immigrants have higher rates of entrepreneurship and also because immigrants helped boost international trade, especially with their countries of origin. By the way, if you are interested about the immigration, I'm going to link over to some videos about that that we've put together at the end of this video.

Speaker 2:          07:24          Education quality

Speaker 1:          07:29          of Israeli education is almost a national hallmark in 1918, 30 years before the founding of the state of Israel, Jewish specialist founded the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel today as one of the highest rates of people with college degrees and the country. It has a lot of success with fusion companies slash universities. Finance for Israeli universities relies mainly on projects financed by private companies, so there are reasons for universities to collaborate with them further, they have achieved the best rate of business creation. In the Oec d, knowledge transfer is a central. This is taking the university and professional world closer together. God, everything went well, so so far we've seen the main keys to success, but that all other influential factors, for example, there is the Jewish Chutzpah, a tendency to question everything. Something that is key in Jewish culture. The military service is also a surprising and important thing is it helps social mobilization.

Speaker 1:          08:21          Forcing young people from different social classes to interact, hey, well, compulsory military service isn't exactly great. It does have some positive effects in this case. Now we could also discuss, for example, and that's y'all yahoo's reforms of 2003, which were essential to Israel's success, but I think it's better to leave that for a future video, but the thing is, thanks to all of what we've discussed today since the 19 eighties, Israel has doubled its population. Multiply the number of jobs by four and grown by an annual average rate of four percent. Today. It's GDP per capita is higher than other countries like Spain or Italy. So what do you think will Israel consolidate itself as the leading technological power in the world? Could its model will be repeated for other countries?
