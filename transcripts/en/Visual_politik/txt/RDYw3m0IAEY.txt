Speaker 1:          00:02          We had the Roman Empire, the Spanish and the British empire. Now we live in the age of the American mm. No, the country has had such a military presence in so many places, even in remote places like Guam in the middle of the Pacific, America has a military base and that's actually pretty useful

Speaker 1:          00:26          that you can buy a mobile phone made in South Korea with just one click. That's the outcome of global capitalism, but also global capitalism would not be possible if trade wasn't safe. Those American bases there, there to protect those ships that move goods from one place to another, and this is really the reason why the US invest so much in having a strong army, which has kind of been unchallenged until now. So now you might be wondering or you might not be who is challenging this empire because of course it's shine up and swell. How is trying to doing this? Well, that's what we're going to see in this video. This is the million dollar question. Why does America have such a big army? You might argue that it doesn't really need one. In fact that just by looking at a map, you can see that America has a big advantage. It's secured by two fairly sizable oceans, making it almost impossible to attack or invade. Nonetheless, America has the biggest army on the planet. It has more than a million active military personnel and almost 800 military bases located in 70 different countries. Territories all over the globe, risen, France and Russia by contrast have about 34 and bases combined.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Just have a look at this map. America is all over the place and there is no country that can challenge them. Well, hold on a second because maybe there is. Yes, you have us. Today we're talking all about Schneider. Errol, visitable. I think we've talked to thousands of times about China's economic progress. It's the world's factory and many Chinese companies are starting to become big competition for the technological bandits, but now we're talking about then military more specifically than military presence in the south China Sea, and believe me, this is no

Speaker 2:          02:20          joke.

Speaker 1:          02:25          China, south China Sea play the end of peaceful rise. The definition string of pearls was first used in 2005 in an international report given by the Department of Defense of the United States. In this report, it was predicted that China will try to expand its naval presence throughout the Indian Ocean region. In this context, the polls are a metaphor for each of the military bases that China wants to build, making a string that goes all the way down to Africa and the Middle East where China imports most of its natural resources and as you can imagine, these military extensions, they scanned the wells, especially America, and they got even more scary when the former trainees, President Hu Jintao, sent this in 2009

Speaker 2:          03:08          the road.

Speaker 3:          03:09          The peaceful development is a strategic choice made by the Chinese government and people in the line of the nations peace loving traditional culture. The trend of our times and the fundamental interests of China who gentle.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Yeah, so for some reason, this quote that was intended to chill out via Americans basically had the opposite effect because it pretty much sounded like China was saying the opposite of what is actually the truth. But okay, I know what you're probably thinking right now. I mean, so what? What was the problem with China trying to increase their military after all, it's just another country. Everyone has an army and wants to be safe rice. I mean, why should we care about China having military basis? Do they really want to surpass the United States? Can they even? Well, today we're going to answer all of those questions, but before we do, as we always do, let's take a look back at the history lessons from the pain. We said America is almost impossible to invade. Whilst there was an exception, and that was in the year 1941, when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii,

Speaker 1:          04:15          a year later, the Japanese invaded the Aleutian islands in Alaska. That was the moment when America learned an important lesson. Nobody is 100 percent safe. It was also the time that they figured they should probably care about protecting the oceans. In fact, during World War Two, the US had to fight among lots of small islands in the Pacific. This was the case during the battle of midway after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese trying to eliminate the US as a strategic power in the Pacific and they hope to succeed by demoralizing the American forces with another surprise attack, American cryptographers. They managed to decipher the date and the location of Japan's attack and prepared a surprise counterattack. Needless to say, the US inflicted irreparable damage to the Japanese fleet. World War Two ended. The Americans won and they remembered that lesson. We can't let this happen again. Sorry. Well, what did they do? Well, they covered the Pacific Ocean with military basis. Basically they kept soldiers on those small islands where they had fought and how you might be wondering, well, why is it so important to have soldiers on a small island? No one really cares about. I mean, is it really that bad if someone wants to invade an asshole, like midway, I mean really and also moving soldiers to the other side of the planet and keeping them that it's not exactly cheap.

Speaker 3:          05:34          Worship is basically a floating city with big guns on it. It's a city that can move travel 500 to a thousand kilometers in one day, so moving one of those from Los Angeles to Shanghai will take more than 10 days,

Speaker 2:          05:49          but if

Speaker 3:          05:49          you already have ships in soldiers in Guam, you can be to Shanghai in almost three days. This is designed to deter potential conflicts.

Speaker 1:          05:58          In fact, most of those ships would never have to fire a single weapon. Being so powerful. Bonnets name, no one would probably dare to attack them, but not only that, many of these ships are not meant to combat other armies, but rather than into combat pirates, for example, the USS Independence is a warship created for the main purpose of combating piracy, and this is just one of many ships, in fact to the U. S naval forces getting bigger and bigger all the time, and this means that so far no one has been able to match it. Maybe to add 46 ships in five years, but 355 ships won't come for a long time. Of course, this gives America a huge amount of power and this can be worrying to some people, but so far it's created a safe environment where everybody can trade on troubles whenever it some country or some pirates, once a block of trade routes, they have to face all those American ships. This is one reason why Southeast Asian nations have become exporting powerhouses, and of course it's benefited China.

Speaker 2:          07:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:07          The truth is that there are many countries that would happily block China's trade routes, but it's China. Comfortable in this position, does it like depending so much on America's army? Well, let's have a look. New Hedge Lamont, so what defines a territory or a territory is an area of land onto the jurisdiction of a ruler or a states. Not all territories are born equal. Some have abundant natural resources like Jen's gas and oil, while others basically having no resources, the availability of some resources gives the country they belong to. Some pretty big advantages in trade. Most obvious example of this is oil and how much she's trade as defined. Saudi Arabia,

Speaker 2:          07:48          it's a common.

Speaker 1:          07:53          What about the others? Those who have lists a few resources, they need to import everything for their industries. They must compete with international bitters to secure stable suppliers of resources, which basically means their industrial cost of production is also going to be higher and this, this steer view is essentially China's situation. Yes, China's got a lot of industry but almost no resources, oil, steel, uranium, most of the things that needs to make those mobile phones, cars or tvs. It's got to come from other parts of the weld and this appetite for raw materials is increasing every single day, but this still isn't the end of our story. Once those resources are required, China needs to transport them to its territory safely and for as little money as possible. The South China Sea is the busiest collection of shipping lanes in the world. It's the lifeblood of East Asia carrying most of it straight in oil. It's obvious then that China would very much like to keep these lines of trade open and preferably to control them.

Speaker 1:          08:55          It also doesn't have a big consumer market like the U, s.so at wants to export a lot of what it makes in order to make money and these routes can be blocked at anytime by one of their neighboring countries, which would stop all of that from happening. The Communist Party, the governing force in China also has a lot of mouths to feed, so control over this region is essential if the party wants to stay in power. All right, so I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. You're probably thinking, well, shiner isn't the only one. Many of the countries have no natural resources either and they don't complain of course, but there is a big problem here being so dependent on imports and exports. China only needs one country to block its roots, to collapse it in a matter of months, and as we mentioned before, there are many countries who would very happily do that, especially one in particular, and that's India.

Speaker 3:          09:42          You see the string of islands on the Indian Ocean. Well, these belong to India and the Indian army could block Chinese boats. This would mean that China couldn't buy most of the oil that they currently consume. Most of the oil tankers that go from the Middle East to China pass through the Strait of Malacca right where Singapore is. We're talking about almost 20 million barrels of oil a day and many other goods in addition,

Speaker 1:          10:12          but if India blocks the roots among those small islands, good luck trying to get that oil. In fact, there is such an existential threat to China that their former president, Hu Jintao, used to call this the Malacca dilemma, and we're not just talking about India. In fact, America isn't getting through their best time when it comes to loving the Chinese either and again, the American navy, it has the capabilities you block the oil supply to China by sea. This would be far more devastating than any trade war so well. What's the solution?

Speaker 3:          10:45          Belt and road initiative and its maritime counterpart, the string of pearls.

Speaker 1:          10:50          The belt and road initiative was initiated by President Xi Jinping in 2013 with the aim of rebuilding infrastructure and accelerating Chinese economic growth. Essentially, this is a brand new silk road and the string of pearls, well, that's its maritime brother. In 2017 Mr. she pledged an additional $124 billion dollars towards says $900,000,000,000 belt and road initiative. China is promoting this global trade infrastructure as a longterm wind wind campaign for the 65 nations that have signed up it. Most Western leaders, however they stayed away from the Chinese. Some is announcing the ambitious projects about so the 28 heads of state presence at what Mr she called a gathering of great minds included President Putin of Russia and President I get on of target.

Speaker 3:          11:38          This is indeed a gathering of great minds in the coming two days. I hope that by engaging in a full exchange of views, we will contribute to pursuing the belt and road initiative, a project of the century so that it will benefit people across the world. See jumping

Speaker 1:          11:54          with China, consolidating its power in relationships with countries all over the south China Sea region. It might become really difficult for the United States to keep being the big boss in charge of the region. If China was to support the US, the United States would lose all of its deterrents power in this key region of the globe and this would completely change the rules of international trade. Americans were pretty worried about this now the other car, the CIA went so far as to state that the US has two major problems right now, Russia and China and their efforts to undermine the u. s is influencing key regions like Africa and the South China Sea,

Speaker 1:          12:33          not naive and we are taking significant steps on the counter intelligence side so that we have all the defenses that we need us. Africa commands, General Thomas Wallet Houser. Alright, so I know you're thinking you're probably thinking America. It's an empire all over the world and we're just talking about one small region, the south China Sea and yeah, that's absolutely right. In fact, China is only threatening us dominance in the south China Sea, not the whole world, but this region. It really is the most important when it comes to international trade. And this is why the struggle is quite so intense that the show, it still goes on.

Speaker 1:          13:14          In fact, China knows that if it goes too far with building military basis, the u s will call on its allies in the region to do the same. This would mean scaling up military spending and look, China and the US, they might not be the best couple on the planet, but they kind of tolerate each other. And also the US, his allies in the region, well, they really do have a problem with China. We've got India, which we mentioned previously. There's also Japan among others, and China does not want those guys to increase their military presence. This is why so far, China is playing a very patient game. It's a very longterm challenge and longterm in Chinese, that means really longterm. We might be talking about decades out, but despite the slow path, you'd better remember the term string of pearls because it's going to appear a lot more in the newspapers.

Speaker 1:          14:05          This is going to be so important that at the beginning of next year on visual politic, we're going to continue telling you more about this in another series of videos that we've got coming up, so you don't want to miss those.
