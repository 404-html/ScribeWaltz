Speaker 1:          00:00          Does the United States need to launch a commercial wharf? Is the US economy in danger due to the high trade deficit that they carry with them each and every year? It's China competing in an unfair way, and how can Donald Trump defend the United States?

Speaker 2:          00:24          Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for 10. I just sold an apartment for $15,000,000 to somebody from China am I supposed to dislike, but we can continuously have other nations taking advantage of the United States like never before. The biggest bank in the world is from China. For many years, no president wanted to go against China economically and we're going to do it because we can't continue to allow China to rape our country and that's what they're doing. In particular with China, we're going to be doing a section three. Oh, one trade action. It could be about $60,000,000,000, but that's really just a fraction of what we're talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Dear viewer intentions are certainly one thing and results. Well, that's entirely another. That's precisely what almost always happens with protectionist policies. That ranger to doing one thing, but they end up doing something totally different. Donald trump was very clear about this during the election campaign that led him to the White House and he has continued to be justice clear since he's arrived in the Oval Office. Protectionist policies are a fantastic idea. I want

Speaker 3:          01:39          those companies and they're starting. I want them back here. I want them back here. They're going to come back here to trump.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Signed new tariffs on steel and aluminum into law. Trump moves to crack down on China trade with $60 million in tariffs on imported products. Trump proposes $100, billion dollars in additional tariffs on Chinese products. So far, only the first terrorist have been approved such as those on steel and as an alum, and it excludes many us allied countries

Speaker 3:          02:11          so that steel and aluminum, your country is not the same.

Speaker 1:          02:16          That's according to the news. Trump is very, very clear about one thing and that one of his main priorities is fighting the external deficits. That is reducing the difference between imports and exports. This is a difference of over $500,000,000,000 every.

Speaker 3:          02:32          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:37          and that is where terrorists boys come into play. It goes something like this, so my people, they want to buy foreign products. Fine. Terrorists will teach them about that. All right. All right, hold on. Let's. Let's be fair. Many argue that trump doesn't really want to get involved in a full blown commercial. Warren, theU , s presidents threats especially against China. Nothing more than a gamble to force Xi Jinping's governments into sitting and negotiate and yeah, that might be saved, but since one never really knows with trump just in case and to clear things up, I think we need to ask ourselves a few important questions. Does it help the United States open fire and trigger a trade war tariffs? Really the best way to help the US economy is China breaking the rules. Are they competing in an unfair way and do we need to punish, but using. Well, let's see. Wall Street

Speaker 4:          03:36          took a hit today. The new news of the terrorists from China took it pretty hard. China's Ministry of Commerce as it is, imposing tariffs on 128 American products sold in China. China announced a 15 percent tariff on us, fruit wines, steel pipes, and other products. This is in response to trump administration tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from China and other countries.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Bad Plan for nonexistent. Here is a question, what does a politician want when he puts protectionist policies on the table and no, no, no, I know what you're thinking and I'm not going to accept a winning votes as a valid answer. Yeah, so look, I know winning votes is every politician's number one priority, but for that very reason that's not sheet. Let's focus on the specifics of protectionist policies. Well, I think we could say that the objectives are usually this defending industrial jobs, punishing alleged unfair competition, usually by poorer countries and boosting the local economy.

Speaker 5:          04:37          Right?

Speaker 1:          04:43          Are those are the intentions, but what are the results? If the United States starts a trade war with China, is it going to achieve those objectives? Well, let's have a look at this step by step. First of all, this is what Donald Trump has to say on the matter. Under my administration, the theft of American prosperity will end. We're going to defend our industry, create a level playing field for the American worker, Donald J dot trump. Wow. Thank goodness that politicians are here to defend the American, be both. By the way, this is absolutely the same excuse he uses to prosecute immigration, defending that American worker, but there is only one problem and to be fair is very big problem and that is that the statistics show a completely different situation. You see the US labor market is undergoing one of the best moments in almost two decades. The unemployment rate is at about four percent and the number of unfilled vacancies is growing enormously. Indeed, the American economic machine is actually beginning to suffer shortages of one of its most important inputs and that's of course

Speaker 5:          05:54          if migration

Speaker 1:          05:55          policies do not change in the economy doesn't collapse. Of course, it is estimated that in the next 10 years the United States will have more than 8 million jobs to be filled, and this is actually happening quite intensely in the Midwest. Instincts like Wisconsin where there's a lot of employment, but very few workers. It's great to have more people working in Wisconsin than ever before, but it creates a challenge. We just essentially need more people. Trisha Brown, chief operating officer for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation right now. Unemployment rates in those states, it below three percent and the new jobs are constantly emerging.

Speaker 1:          06:44          For example, the Taiwanese technology group, Foxconn, is investing more than $10,000,000,000 in a gigantic campus. Do developments, produced new smartphones, tablets, and television screens. It's going to employ more than 13,000 people. The situation is so peculiar that state authorities have been forced to launch an advertising campaign, for example, on trains in Chicago and indeed here on Youtube in order to attract workers to the state, but not only that you seek. The truth is that the manufacturing industry now employs a lot fewer people than it did two decades ago, but do you think this is actually due to Chinese competition?

Speaker 5:          07:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:22          Well, the reality is the numbers tell quite a different story. Not only his employment at its highest levels in US economic history, industrial production has also reached its highest levels. Yes, the industry has fewer people, but that doesn't mean it produces any less. What's happening is the factories thanks to robots and technology are becoming increasingly productive.

Speaker 1:          07:47          So, uh, how about an example of this? Let's take a look at the steel industry, which trump said is being threatened by Chinese competition. Indeed, his stated that this poses a danger to national security. Well, the truth is that the US produces 70 percent of the steel it consumes for which only three percent is actually intended for military use. So him saying national security leads me to the reply, rarely ends on top of that. China, it's not even in the top 10 suppliers. Yeah. Employment in the steel industry has decreased to almost half in the last 10 years. But folks, the vast majority of jobs aren't lost due to China or international trade, but simply due to technology and look a commercial war. It's not gonna change that spots, as you can probably see, this isn't precisely bad nowadays in the United States, there are more jobs than ever. And the trade deficits, well, despite what trump might say, isn't really that high. Being less than three percent of the GDP and in fact it has decreased considerably in recent years.

Speaker 5:          08:49          Yes.

Speaker 1:          08:57          We're all saying ready for getting some other important details. Like for example the investments. You heard that right? The United States has a positive net investment balance. That is foreigners invest more in the United States than Americans do abroad, which is obviously very good for the US economy's future in 2017. This positive balance surpassed $250,000,000,000. Anything that's all. Well you are very, very wrong. Now we've don't know if a commercial wall would decrease the external deficits, but it would have other not exactly desirable consequences, so well, listen up to this

Speaker 3:          09:45          consequences.

Speaker 1:          09:49          Let me say it loud and let me say a clear. The ones who'd be most effected by a trade war against Chinese imports would be u s companies. Yes. You had that rise. I did not screw it up. Buying cheaper materials abroad decreases production costs for local industries, and if in addition, a foreign country in this case trying to sell it below cost, it'd been like Beijing was subsidizing American Industries at this point. You might be thinking, well, this sounds really good about, is it actually right? Well, take a look at this

Speaker 3:          10:21          now.

Speaker 1:          10:21          We need to bear in mind that the United States not only important products to consume from China, they also important many intermediate goods and capital goods such as machinery. In fact, more than half of all imports from China corresponds to this type of product.

Speaker 3:          10:39          Sorry,

Speaker 1:          10:40          now comes an essential question. What with the terrorists actually achieve? Well, it's precisely that it would damage American companies competitive now it would increase the cost of producing much more advanced goods and aspects in which the North American industry is currently a leader. This would mean decreasing their exports to the rest of the world as well as the consumption capacity of Americans themselves and the results of this well, that's millions of jobs being destroyed,

Speaker 3:          11:10          right?

Speaker 1:          11:13          Example of the new tariff on steel and aluminium will make production in the United States of things. They use steel and minium like cars and airplanes more expensive and therefore less competitive. Will new tariffs have to be set on cars in order to offset this hire local production costs. And this explains why when in 2000 and to President George W Bush impose tariffs on imported steel to the toll was the destruction of 200,000 jobs. This was a clear backfire if the intended.

Speaker 3:          11:48          I see. Yup.

Speaker 1:          11:51          That is another really detail. Yeah. When you sat terrorists, the usual reaction is for the other posse to defend itself. I'm not saying it's the right thing to do, but it does happen. The United States announces an additional $100,000,000,000 list of tariffs. China has already fully prepared and will not hesitate to immediately make a fierce counter straight golfing. China's commerce ministry spokesman. Alright, so let us use the example of Boeing. China is the largest market today for this company and in the next few years it's going to deliver hundreds of new aircrafts to China. Well, it commercial wart would absolutely damaged their longterm competitive position, for example, other companies such as Abas and accelerate the development of a local industry. Yes, it does seem difficult today, but in the longterm, the consequences could be absolutely gigantic and that's not even to say that China could results the other less orthodox means. For example, let us not forget that China is the largest foreign desk for the United States. Would it be good for Washington if China stopped buying data or if they began decreasing securities in order to incite pressure? Well, these are pretty obvious questions. The answer is definitely no. This is especially due to the huge public deficit that the current administration is fueling, but wait just a moment because there is something that trump is absolutely right about,

Speaker 1:          13:25          is trying to breaking the rules. Trump has one thing, right? China isn't precisely a free market or a country that plays well with others and it isn't just about the fact that they have high tariffs or that they favor local companies. They're all of them is for example, a lack mailing. Large multinational. For example, if foreign companies want to sell freely in China, they have to ally with local partners, partners who can access that technology and Oh yes, this technology transfer is a problem in some ways because these Chinese companies, than use this technology to grow and compete. However technological companies know what they're getting themselves into when they access the Chinese market, it has to be them who decided where to produce, how to compete, and to what businesses to get involved in.

Speaker 1:          14:20          Of course, this doesn't mean that the US government should have pressure or negotiate with China, but unleashing a commercial, what would be a terribly bad solution, so listen, as long as it's just threats, the US, they're going to be all right, but they have to be careful not to cross the light. This is how a big crisis would start. Fortunately, unless trump insists, it really looks like this isn't gonna happen. China initiate WTO dispute complaint against us tariffs on steel and aluminum products. President Xi Jinping announces plans to open up China's economy, including lowering tariffs for autos and enforcing the legal intellectual property of foreign firms. Now, having said all of this, let's just wait a moment because there is still a question on the table and that's how can the United States reduce its trade deficits? Well, the best way to achieve this is with bets with structural policies, doing what great exporting powers like Germany and Switzerland, it favorite saving and therefore longterm productive investment decreases the public deficit which boosts import consumption bike overheating. The economy improves the competitiveness of local businesses

Speaker 1:          15:29          since reducing bureaucracy, favoring talents attraction, yes, immigration and lowering taxes as the last fiscal reform of the Republican Party did, which we talked about in a previous video. Those are the paths that should be taken while they commercial war. That's going to be just bad for everyone, as in any case, external deficit doesn't have to be bad. It all depends on how much the economy grows, what it is used for, or what happens with the investments. Well, now over to you, do you favor setting tariffs on China?

Speaker 4:          16:15          Wall Street took a hit today. The new news that the terrorists from China took it pretty hard. China's Ministry of Commerce as it is, imposing tariffs on 128 American products sold in China.
