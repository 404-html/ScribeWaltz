Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          I'm going to ask you a question and don't google it. What's the biggest agricultural power in Europe? Who is the biggest food export in the entire European Union? How many of you might think Spain, Italy or even France after all these countries have good weather and thousands upon thousands of hectares of arable land?

Speaker 2:          00:32          None of these countries though comes close to the Netherlands, also known as Holland. To give you a better idea of the Netherlands is almost the largest food exporter in the world. Second only to the United States, and this is kind of a surprise because we're talking about a country here that is so small. They had to build a dams to reclaim lambs from the seed. In fact, it's one of the most densely populated countries in the world to this. We need to add the fact that they are one of the richest ans most modern countries on the planets. The first stock markets was created in Amsterdam and man's. I'm sure all of you know Dutch companies like Shell, Philips or the bank. Ing.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Normally when a country has many industrial or service companies, agriculture is placed on the back burner. So now you might be wondering, well, why? Why is the Netherlands such a big food producer? Well, imagine that we have a piece of land, for example, we'll say in Spain that measures one hector, if you use it to plant potatoes, we can earn between 7,000 and 8,000 euros per hector. Imagine instead the amount of money that we could earn if we use that area to build a factory or an office building. When you do that kind of math, that quickly becomes clear. Why countries move away from agriculture? Well, despite all of this, Holland is the world leader of potato exports about France above Spain, above even the US.

Speaker 2:          01:56          And now I can probably guess what something you're thinking agriculture in Europe, I mean Brussels has got to be giving out grants somewhere, right? Agriculture is indeed one of the most protected sectors with the most aid in the entire European Union. However, the Netherlands isn't the country that receives the most money. Of course they receive aid like any other member country, but they don't even get a third of what grease gets. And if we compare it with larger countries like France, the difference in aid is huge. So how is it possible that with so nessel lambs and so little help, Holland has become the garden of the world? Well, as you can imagine, the answer is simply explained in one word, technology. In a farm in the Netherlands, we can find a tractors that drive themselves as drones that monitor crops and of course resource optimization at the highest level. However, there's still a question here, why does hollins have more modern agriculture than for example, Spain? Also, what is the Netherlands done that can be imitators in other countries? Well today we're going to answer these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at their history

Speaker 2:          03:07          from the field to the university. In the 1970s Hollands had one of the most prosperous economies in all of Europe. Companies such as Phillips and Abis were conquering the international markets. And all of this was great news for the Netherlands. But as we always say on a visual politic, not everything was a field of racist. Imagine being 20 years old and living in the Netherlands back then. Where would you have liked to work in an international company like Phillips with high salaries and good conditions on your father's farm? Well, exactly, Dutch agriculture. It was on the verge of disappearing and we also have to add something very important to this. As we said before, the Netherlands is very small and there's hardly any space for large font.

Speaker 2:          03:53          Now, for example, there's plenty of lands in the United States and that means that farmers can group and creates a large farm. In fact, today and lots of American farms belonged to large corporations. This means that they can scale investments and by for example, planes to fumigate huge areas of lambs. However, in the case of the Netherlands, farms are small with an average size of around seven hacks as making large investments really very complicated. To make matters worse. By the seventies Dutch salaries were already much higher than in other European countries. In other words, unlike the farmers in southern Italy, the Dutch couldn't compete with low prices and you might be wondering now why did they need agricor?

Speaker 1:          04:31          Sure.

Speaker 2:          04:35          After rule in those years there was already a certain degree of international trade. Then Netherlands goods imports, food while they manufacturer televisions or bad things, rice. Well, yeah, that that is rice and from a purely economic point of view, they could have easily let go of their primary sex there. Well, the reality is in life, not everything is just the economy and it's in hollins forming associations have a lot of power more so than in pretty much every other country. For example, in many other countries they have something called the social dialogue table, which is an organization where the government, employers and unions, meat on the Netherlands. I have something similar at along with employers and unions, farmers and ranchers associations are also welcome and in the 1970s Dutch farmers and ranchers weren't willing to change jobs. So consider yourself put in this situation, hollins hat, to maintain its primary sector at all costs. But at the same time, all of the odds were stacked against them. At this point, I know you must be thinking they did grants. The solution would be to simply give subsidies to farmers so they'd stop protesting. Right. This is been exactly need the first or the last time that such policies have been applied, but the Dutch government, they actually had other plans now that they had to maintain their primary sector. They wanted to do it well and since they couldn't reduce salaries or group farms, there was only one solution left and that was to improve productivity. That is getting the farmers to produce more and better food. Well, how did they do as well? That's exactly what we're going to look into right now.

Speaker 2:          06:13          The University of Bugging Meghan, you've probably heard this sentiment is a thousand times silicon valley wouldn't be what it is today if it weren't for Stanford University. It's the Maca on research for everything that has to do with electronics and telecommunications, but they don't only do research. They also train the best computer scientists in the world. And when those computer scientists and even the university, they go directly to big companies like Google, apple, and Tesla. Well, there's far as agriculture is concerned. The macro of innovation isn't actually in the u s but it's in the Netherlands. We're talking about the University of bargaining and also known as food valley. Many of you might not have heard about this university. That's because the only work in the world of ag. Right.

Speaker 1:          06:59          Gotcha.

Speaker 2:          07:02          That don't have degrees in law or art history. Volga nivens motto is to improve food quality for the entire world. So you might be wondering right now why what's so special about this university or the first difference is money. The Netherlands knew that they needed technology to improve their farming so well, what did they do? Well, they showered there. Scientists with money in just two decades, the university's research budget doubled that. Hold on just a moment because money is not the only important thing here. The truth is the most important thing. It wasn't how much but where the money was coming,

Speaker 1:          07:39          see

Speaker 2:          07:40          in many European countries. And then most of Latin American, there's a very clear line that separates public and private universities. Public universities are funded from the state. Of course, they can have some sort of collaboration with private companies, but that's not their main source of funding. Long in Nixon's case is different. 50% of their money comes from the government, 25% from the university's own income and to the last 25% from private companies, and I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. Private company is funding a university. Does this mean that the university is private now? Well, no, but it does bring a great advantage. It allows the university to be connected with the rest of society.

Speaker 3:          08:20          When we went well

Speaker 2:          08:22          preparing this video, we had a phone call with a farmer called sees a bravo and Spain more specifically, he's from the Canary Islands and we asked you about how agricultural modernization works. Now, you might not know this, but livestock is actually very important in the Canary Islands, especially goats. They have a specific type of good, they're called the palm, the goats, which is unique from any other breed. In the world. There are actually several institutes and foundations dedicated to studying this specific type of goat. However, as Caesar explained, practically none of the studies are actually useful to,

Speaker 2:          08:59          I mean, think about it. If you have a goat farm, what kind of research do you really need? As a foreigner? You want to know how to produce more and better milk, so these on how to better feed the animals, dietary supplements or even genetic engineering are useful. Well, if you go to the ICAA website, for example, which is the Canary Institute use of Agricultural Research, you won't find anything like that. There are tons of academic articles that explain the breed origin of the palm egos, whether it's related to other guys in Morocco or Tanzania or if they existed during the middle ages, but price kill usage, that kind of zeroes. Meanwhile, according to the times higher education ranking Vargon Nigga and studies are the most cited in their fields, but that's not all. I bet you can't guess what the university's official languages, given that it's in Hollands, you'd probably be thinking they would be speaking Dutch, right? Well, no, not at all. We're talking about the capital of agricultural research here and because of this, more than 40% of the students and research stuff, a foreign, no matter where you're from, if you have a talent in agriculture, you can get to a place at this university

Speaker 2:          10:09          record numbers of foreign students at Dutch universities of technology because of this international makeup. The official language of the university is English. That explains why it bargaining and is, for example, a pioneer in led lamps for greenhouses, which allows for the creation of precisely controlled artificial microclimates. Thanks to this, the Netherlands is one of the leaders in tomato grief. Even though in natural conditions, tomatoes would never grow in such a cold country and there's more here in a country like the u s farmers need about 126 liters of water to grow one kilogram of tomatoes. Well, thanks to this university's research, now one can produce the same amounts with just eight liters of water. This is an incredible amounts of saving in both economic and ecological terms. But hold on a minute here because research is good, but it isn't really worth anything if it stays within the university. And in that regard, the Netherlands is again, a great example of how things are being done right from the university to the field. Let's get back to Spain for a moment. Imagine that we have a tomato garden and we want to invest in this hydroponic technology that will allow us to save water, the European Union, or more precisely the common agricultural policy provides all kinds of grants so that farmers can modernize their fields. So we'll go to the agricultural extension agency where all of these grants and managed, so the farmers getting their money there and then they will make sure that they spend it on improving production techniques. So far so good.

Speaker 2:          11:41          But how to farm know which machines to purchase. One would think that the farmer would know better than anyone what their lands would need. But the truth is that the agricultural wells evolves as quickly as Internet companies. And if nobody advises the farmer, they'll have to find the information out themselves. Well, that's the situation in which almost every Spanish farmer has found themselves. There's a huge gap between the university and the fields. The dage case though is entirely different. In the Netherlands, they have these so called agricultural council officers. That means that there's someone there who will explain to the farmer what type of machine they need to buy and what technologies are best suited for that type of crime. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          12:23          and what's the result of all of this? Well, Dutch fields look nothing like those in any other country. What most of European countries consume tons of antibiotics for their animals. The Netherlands farmers are already using the most advanced veterinarian techniques in such a way that they can prevent diseases instead of curing them. The same happens with plants, pesticides in this country. They notice that if they use drones to monitor the crops, they can control each and every one of the vegetables and prevent them from becoming infected. And in a country where almost half of the crop, so irrigators and they have managed to decrease their water consumption by almost 90% further agricultural product exports surpassed 92 billion euros last year. Not any of that. Hololens is also making money by exporting that technology. The United Arab Emirates goes Dutch to ensure their food security.

Speaker 2:          13:18          So the question now becomes do you think other countries can import these kinds of policies? How far in the technologies developed in Hollins go to feed the rest of the world? I'll leave your answer in the comments below and before we finish, I'd like to thank cs a Bravo and Angel Gogo from agq nutrition for helping us with this video as if you're interested in this subject, will seem to be releasing another video explaining the common agricultural policy that we mentioned in this video in depth.
