Speaker 1:          00:09          Heroin, visual politic, we've already made several videos about how Venezuela is going through its toughest times, however we still need to address one of the most serious consequences of the Bolivarian Revolution is gigantic failure and there's no debate here. Venezuela is adrift with every day that passes life in this country. It just becomes harder and harder with some of the highest violence, poverty and inflation indices in the worlds and with a growing drug trafficking and organized crime industry. Many, many Venezuelans condo find any alternative to putting some space between themselves and their homelands. That is even behind the country that's falling apart.

Speaker 2:          00:48          Ministry, Latina, so Seattle bullied the Tara.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Well, if you were in a situation like this, would any of you have any hope? I mean, I would certainly try to escape and that's exactly what more and more Venezuelans are doing, especially the youngest ones. Now, some of you might be wondering, well, okay Simon, but how big is this problem? In reality, what you see, according to the UN's calculations from 2014 to June of 2018, around at two point 3 million Venezuelans left their country and these numbers, they're not gonna. Stop from growing anytime soon.

Speaker 2:          01:24          See when total of one I see. Let me see. Hold on the door for them.

Speaker 1:          01:31          In other words, the Bolivarian Revolution has caused the greatest exodus in the history of Latin America, so listen up.

Speaker 3:          01:46          The exodus,

Speaker 1:          01:50          societies are entities in constant movement throughout history, migration has been continuous, whether economic or for political reasons, to find better opportunities to escape from a threat or simply to escape bad living conditions. People are continually moving from one place to another,

Speaker 3:          02:07          not that

Speaker 1:          02:10          however, an exodus is something quite different. The term exodus refers to the mass immigration of people who are forced to leave the place where they live. That is to say it isn't about people who dream of a better life, but people who have to leave in order to survive. In general, throughout history, the most common causes have been political, racial, or religious. Perhaps the most common type of exodus throughout history has been that bite people forced to leave their homes because another stronger group took over and expelled them. Violence.

Speaker 1:          02:39          For example, there's the exodus of the Armenian people in Nineteen 15 when hundreds of thousands of people were forced to escape from the Turkish empire, a process that became known as the Armenian genocide. I know the case would be bass of the tens of thousands of Republicans who faced the threat of reprisal, torture, and condemnation of all kinds from the frank [inaudible] and were forced to leave Spain the end of the Spanish civil war or what happens in the second world war or with the fight for independence in African and Asian countries in the 19 sixties. Well, in all times we've had two very clear examples. The first was a product of the Syrian civil war, which since its beginning in 2011, has driven millions of people to move inside and outside of its borders. The second case is that a Venezuelan, then everything indicates that it's exodus will end up being much, much bigger than serious at this moment. The migration of Venezuelans should be described as a forced migration as it's not planned. It's for survival. Beatrice Borgess, executive director of the Justice and Peace Center in Venezuela because folks, we need to understand what's happening here, understand that the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who are escaping, they don't do it for pleasure, they do it out of necessity, and unlike the examples we've covered here, the Venezuelan exodus isn't the result of a war or the occupation of a foreign force, but have the hunger fear and the misery caused by the Bolivarian Revolution.

Speaker 1:          04:05          You see, according to the mass living condition survey in 2018, 87 percent of Venezuelans living poverty and more than 60 percent in extreme poverty. These are sub Saharan African numbers.

Speaker 3:          04:16          Yes.

Speaker 1:          04:18          The paradox is that this humanitarian catastrophe is happening in one of the most important oil powers in the world.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Folks, the situation, it's beginning to get real serious. For example, due to a lack of medicine and health equipment within the country, diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, and malaria. Diseases that have been eradicated in the country haven't only reemerged in some cases they've become real epidemics, ends what's more, there are more than 100,000 HIV AIDS patients at risk due to a lack of access to necessary medication. United Nations Office for the Coordination of human affairs, and of course this lack of medicine has lethal consequences for the population, but that's not all. Venezuela is experiencing such a huge production and supply problem that it's becoming increasingly difficult to acquire basic food products. For example, the can of tuna can cost more than a minimum wage salary. That athletics explains why according to data from the United Nations where ideas Datto, Qbo and the rest of the regime, John's a growing fat lobster dinners around one and a half million Venezuelans are currently suffering from malnutrition and then there's the violence issue, which is also no joke. Homicide statistics for example, are out levels typical of a country in a civil war. Check this out and then there's of course robberies, losing extortion, and all the other crimes that have made this country a very dangerous place to live and the Bolivarian Place. They don't help listen

Speaker 3:          05:56          more than percent

Speaker 1:          05:58          of the crimes. In July, we're committed by police officials, Venezuelan observatory of violence, so faced with this scenario, we can't be surprised that just in the last three years, 2 million Venezuelans have left the country by sea and land

Speaker 3:          06:12          that's

Speaker 1:          06:15          surely you've all seen the huge rows of Venezuelans walking step by step towards the border because most of those who flee on foot or sometimes take buses, calls, mules, but lately many have begun simply walking to Columbia, Brazil, and Ecuador first and then maybe from that of hurry, Chile or Argentina. Of course, this is not an easy trip. The journey is hard not only because of how tiring it isn't because of what they leave behind families, friends in their homes, but in many cases, these refugees fall victim to fraudsters, thieves until the nefarious characters. Fortunately so far, the other Latin American countries have shown great solidarity and have allowed almost unrestricted entry to the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. However, this could all change. Receiving so many people at once isn't always easy, especially if the recipients on exactly rich countries, huge pressure

Speaker 3:          07:14          folks.

Speaker 1:          07:15          It's true, some Latin American countries are beginning to feel a lot of pressure. The Venezuelan exodus is so great. Then in some cases they're facing serious capacity problems. For example, in the border stage of Reimer in Brazil, the number of Venezuelans attending medical centers has increased from 700 in 2014 to more than 50,000 in 2017 just in the first three months of 2018. The number reached over 45,000 every day around seven to 800 Venezuelans cross the border and that's creating a lot of trouble for their vaccination and organization. Michel Temer, president of Brazil in Columbia, the number of Venezuelans already exceeds 1 million people. In Peru, there are more than $400,000 in Ecuador. It's almost a quarter of a million. The way this is so big that in 2018, so far more than 4,000 Venezuelans have arrived in Ecuador every day. Of course, many of them go onto other countries, countries like Chile, which in the first six months between January and June received almost 150,000 Venezuelans. All of this is causing the most effected countries to begin establishing some measures to reduce this huge flow of people. The Brazilian government, for example, has announced the deployment of the military at the border and just stated that it will consider establishing quotas that is a maximum number of people who can enter the country for their past Ecuador and Peru have begun to demand the presentation of passports. And why is that? Well, that's because possible. It's not exactly easy to obtain and Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela because for one, there's a bureaucratic labyrinth and also the simple facts that the government lacks. The paper needed to actually print.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Oh, and then there's little say the Fang that because many officials do great business by selling possibles on the black market where a simple possibilities, official price is only about the equivalent of twenty cents can cost between $705,500 depending on how quickly you need us or how much money the buyer has

Speaker 4:          09:10          the new face or face to own new.

Speaker 1:          09:18          And for those who are lucky enough to already have a passport when it expires, they can extend its validity for two more years with a stamp because they won't get another passport. But even so, getting that stamp, unless you go through the black market, can take up to three months

Speaker 4:          09:37          chocolate

Speaker 1:          09:40          anyway, that's the way things are for the first time. Last in America is facing a serious problem with its borders and it's not an easy problem. On the one hand, you can't prevent Venezuelans from coming in. It's a humanitarian issue and there's still a huge margin of refugees to citizens, but it's evidence that if things go on like this, more and more people will try to escape the country. And that's quite a challenge here. Every Latin American country needs to work in a coordinated manner and receive support from the international community. Of course, to be fatty acid and solidarity shown by many of the regions countries has been extraordinary. It's been an incredible example of that in unity. And by the way, one final note here isn't really common. Venezuelans who were leaving in recent years, many Venezuelans who made a fortune during the bolivarian revolution, dark period as well as the families of many high ranking officials if also left, and of course they've done it with a full wallet.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Former ministers of Chavez hit 2 billion euros and on Dora the opulent landing of Venezuelan millionaires in Spain, a dozen businessman and former top officials, some of them detained for corruption, have invested tens of millions in luxury real estate and hunting ranches. These are known as Bala Chicos and we're going to try and do a video about them in the future, but for now it's your turn.
