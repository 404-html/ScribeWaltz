Speaker 1:          00:14          It seems to be in the Korean Peninsula, the drums of war are constantly rumbling, certainly true that this area is not known for its peacefulness, but the kind of tension that the area has been recently feeling has not existed for some time. The United States, the country which already had 30,000 soldiers deployed in the area, has also deployed several aircraft carriers, heavy bombers, and even advanced anti missile system in South Korea. It is so advanced that China has even considered it a threat to their own security,

Speaker 2:          00:49          trying to tells us to remove antimissile key h, a d system from South Korea amid spying fears.

Speaker 1:          00:56          North Korea on the other hand, keeps carrying out a new tests with ballistic missiles and is progressing with its nuclear program. It seems that North Korea doesn't really care about all the international legislation about nonproliferation and nuclear testing. Japan and South Korea are feeling understandably temps. They want to know what to do, what decisions to make step by step in order to stop the growing threat. That is Kim Jong. UHM, North Korea. His most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable. You'll need to take a stand. We already told you in a previous video here at visual politic about how Japan is seriously considering putting an end to the pacifists nature of their constitution and it seems that right now, even Beijing has had enough of Pyongyang

Speaker 2:          01:41          quarterly, sent a 150,000 troops to North Korea's border.

Speaker 1:          01:44          If this story were a movie, I'd probably leave the center and thinking that the writer had taken too much creative liberty

Speaker 3:          01:51          dynamic.

Speaker 1:          01:59          What is really happening in this region? What can we actually expect? Well, that's what we're going to talk about in this visual politic video, but before we get into all of that, let's get some perspective. Where are we and how did we get to the situation in North Korea is some sort of nightmare from the past. It's a country still living in the cold water country with one of the most totalitarian governments in the world, and along with all of that, it's also one of the poorest countries on the planet. According to the United Nations. Two out of five North Korean suffer from undernourishment buckskin. Joe [inaudible], the guy who controls the country with an iron fist, doesn't seem to give a damn about any of that site. It is estimated the Pyongyang started to develop its nuclear program around the 19 eighties and since then there have been a few key situations which have sped up this progress. The first was the fall, the Soviet Union in 1991. Then game George W dot Bush's incorporation of North Korea into these so called axis of evil in 2002. Then the was the coming to power of Kim Jong EU in 2011. We could say that every time the regime felt threatened, they decided to accelerate the process. Bob, so we're going to discuss that later in the video.

Speaker 2:          03:21          The issue is today, it is estimated that North Korea holds from 10 to 20 nuclear weapons and according to the Rand Corporation, if it doesn't stop producing them, the North Korean program could accumulate around 100 nuclear bombs by the year 20, 20.

Speaker 1:          03:36          But do you wait for just a second because this isn't the end of the story, but now the technology used in this country as well? It's pretty basic. It's based on old designs from the Soviet Union, so the bombs they have developed up until now, they don't work. Brilliant.

Speaker 3:          03:50          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:54          That is why Pyongyang is now obsessed with two things. On the one hand, attempting to miniaturize the bombs so they can be placed in missiles. On the other hand is developing ballistic missiles capable of attacking targets that all thousands of miles away. The last tests they've conducted indicate that they are probably making some important advances. Many analysts, including the intelligence services of South Korea and the United States have considered the North Korea is already capable of weaponizing short and mid range missiles with nuclear warheads which could allow them to reach South Korea and Japan. That's not all. It seems clear that if the program doesn't stop in a few years, North Korea will be capable of attacking the United States of America with ballistic missiles. This would be a significant strategic leap for North Korea and that difference is a red line. Which is causing the Pentagon many, many headaches. So now you might be wondering, well, hasn't the US done anything to stop this country as well? The truth is that they have tried almost every

Speaker 2:          05:10          us strategy.

Speaker 3:          05:12          Yes,

Speaker 1:          05:13          the United States and South Korea have trying to persuade Pyongyang to abandon that plan of developing nuclear weapons and well, they didn't have any problem taking out a checkbook in order to do this

Speaker 2:          05:25          in the early nineties, 1994 to be specific, Bill Clinton signed the agreement framework by which North Korea committed to cancel it's military plans in exchange for generous fueled help from the United States, as well as assistance to build two nuclear reactors for civilian use. With this disagreements,

Speaker 1:          05:42          North Korea obtains the energy they needed to develop that economy. As for South Korea, besides giving a huge amount of humanitarian aid, they also committed to boost and finance North Korea's economic development programs. It all seem to be going well for a while. However, it all fills pieces in 2002. When George W dot Bush founds out that Pyongyang had been fooling them in secret North Korea at kept developing its nuclear programs for military purposes. After more negotiations, they reached a new agreements and Bush's administration restarted their age program and lifted sanctions spots. A year later, Pyongyang reneged on the deal. Despite all of this, Barack Obama decided to try yet again in February 2012, they reach a new agreement. North Korea canceled the nuclear program and the United States restarted once again the economic game. This time Pyongyang broke the agreement only six weeks later. All right, so now you're beginning to get the picture. So now you might be wondering, well, why a North Korea? So insistence on having nuclear weapons at all, what are each looking for? The regime of Kim Jong UN is pretty set on developing more advanced nuclear weapons and the international community is going to have to get used to the idea that this is not something they are going to abandon, but that still leaves us with the question of why. Well, first of all, because they think that nuclear weapons are essential for the survival. Young young knows that with nuclear weapons around no foreign power, especially the United States, would dat intervene in the country

Speaker 1:          07:23          when the United States invaded Iraq, North Korean leaders, they were paying attention, but then the first mistake Saddam Hussein made was not having nuclear weapons and other wmds. They thought the same thing. When Gaddafi's regime fell, there'd be a voluntarily canceled it's program for the development of wmds a few years earlier,

Speaker 1:          07:43          so the North Korean leadership thinks, and so honestly that probably right, that nuclear weapons are the best guarantee to staying in power. Further, the sales of nuclear weapons technology is one of the main sources of foreign currency coming into the country currency that's needed so the elite can maintain their standards of living since the fall of the Soviet Union. North Korea has become one of the main exporters of missile equipment technology and components. USC says North Korean ship taking missiles to Yemen. Also, indications are that North Korea has sold nuclear technology to Iran and advised Syria in the construction of a nuclear reactor that Israel bombarded in 2007 is really strike targeted Syrian nuclear reactor. The Telegraph, it is precisely this risk of proliferation, which is why the United States is trying so hard to stop North Korea. The other reason is, of course, do you try to prevent this country from being capable of threatening the United States with a nuclear attack so well now we come to China and what China thinks of all of this

Speaker 3:          08:48          China. One

Speaker 1:          08:50          thing is if it weren't for trying to support North Korea would have never developed its nuclear and it isn't just the technological part that we're talking about here or the support to avoid international penalties. It's also the money trying to accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea's total trade daily and k. In other words, without the support of Beijing, this country, it would have collapsed a long time ago. However, there are some signs which tell us China, well, they're a bit tied up so much provocation because they're not happy about this nuclear missiles either. It could be said for Beijing killing Yang is now a burden that China has to deal with as it attempts to gain influence and leadership in international politics. Trying to take the driver's seat on free trade. Some analysts have even suggested the Beijing might be losing control over the government of Pyongyang, which is now self absorbed by then new nuclear capability.

Speaker 1:          09:41          Importantly, for the first time in November of 2006, China agreed to completely stick with the international sanctions being leveled against North Korea. Besides in the last few months. China is forbid a North Korean coal imports and gas exports and weld. The international community is holding its breath. That is a significant punishments that Kim Jong, Uhm, regime ams wealth is more international relations between these two countries is not at its best points. In fact, since Kim Jong Un women came to power, no top level bilateral meetings have taken place. And now less and less official visits between the countries. So the question is, is Beijing really changing its relationship with Pyong Yang?

Speaker 4:          10:20          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:24          a road to solution.

Speaker 1:          10:28          It is still to seemed tonight, but don't be fooled for the time being. China is not going to let North Korea fall, which is still an ally for them in the region, at least not until they have serious reasons to do so. That is a key point to understand. If we want to find a solution to this crisis, China needs to be persuaded to try and make Pyongyang put an end to this, cancel their nuclear program and carry out real reforms, but that winds happen under the current setup. That is why many experts think it is time for the United States to withdraw from Korea and consider dismantling the anti missile system and perhaps consider some economic compensation as well. It is also important that China understands that the current situation might need South Korea and Japan to pursue an arms race as well as the option of developing that own nuclear weapons.

Speaker 1:          11:15          So now we've told you our opinion here at visual politic and we'd love to know what you think. Click here if you. Once you leave your opinion in a quick survey.
