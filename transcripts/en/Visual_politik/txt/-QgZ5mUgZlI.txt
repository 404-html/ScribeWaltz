Speaker 1:          00:00          Congratulations. Yes. Do you when? Well, to all of us, dear view is a visual politic. It may have gone unnoticed, but this is a historical events. This not for the first time in the entire history of humanity. We live in a world where poverty no longer effect. Most of the population surprised

Speaker 2:          00:23          well,

Speaker 1:          00:24          you shouldn't be here or visual politic. We've already told you that this was about to happen. Folks today, let's forget all about the apocalyptic perspectives that we've covered for so many years about the world we live in. The truth is that today on our planet's most of the population either belongs to the middle class or do the wealthiest classes.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:45          In other words, as you can see, poverty is now not such a looming issue that is still a lot of poverty, but the truth is that we've never before known a world where poverty didn't affect most of the population and don't tell me that that's not great news, but just hold on a second because some of you might be asking some questions in your mind right now. Like for example, well, what on earth are you talking about, Simon? What do you mean exactly? If that's the case, why is everyone so pessimistic? Or maybe you're even asking, is all of this sustainable? Can the environments with the such a heavy burden? Oh, we have perhaps on the threshold of the world's very destruction. Well, we're going to explore all of those questions in today's video. So that's up. The general impression of most people you can't deny it is that we live in a world full of misery of inequality or injustice and yes, all of that does exist, but fortunately it's becoming less frequent.

Speaker 3:          01:53          Just one area or with just one plane. Monday, a battery fire in an auxiliary power unit in the belly of the plane.

Speaker 1:          02:01          Right now it's rated as very unhealthy by the US embassy monitoring site. Extraordinary snake of trash. I mean literally it rolls around the hillside, so yeah, every time you turn on the TV or your visit a news website, you'll find catastrophes of all sorts of kinds. Unfortunately, we don't usually find much good news even though this is the kind that is generally much more

Speaker 2:          02:25          awesome.

Speaker 1:          02:29          You'll see, according to the Brookings Institute in the world, datalabs estimates, we hit an extraordinary milestone this past September of 2018 for the first time in the history of mankind to most people who live in the world are no longer poor. We're talking about more than 50 percent of the world's population. Approximately three point 8 billion people who belong to a middle class or wealthy homes. In fact, this is the rough distribution of the world's population today, so

Speaker 2:          02:55          bounce.

Speaker 1:          03:02          Now, some of you might be wondering, well, what exactly do you mean by middle class time? Well, fundamentally this is people with enough purchasing power. Do you allow them to live comfortably? That is they can buy washing machines and refrigerators, they can go to restaurants and they can go on vacation. They can endure some unexpected instability such as an illness or a period of unemployment without falling back into

Speaker 2:          03:26          awesome.

Speaker 1:          03:29          To be more specific for this particular studies offers the households that have a consumption capacity of more than $11 per day per person that just did for the price level are part of the middle class.

Speaker 2:          03:40          Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:42          That is not all the best is yet to come. That allow me to explain. As you know, there's still a lot of poverty in the world. No less than 650 million people live in extreme poverty. They aren't even guaranteed the most basic things like food and of course 650 million people is far too. The good news is that changes are happening so quickly that in the next few decades this issue may have disappeared entirely, so now you might be wondering, well, how fast are we really talking about here? Well, to give you an idea of how fast things are changing, check out these figures

Speaker 1:          04:20          in all wells for every second that passes, one person escapes extreme poverty every single second. It is exactly this lightening fast rate that has caused the population living in conditions of extreme poverty to fall by 75 percent from 1990 to 2015, but even with this news, without a doubt, what's most surprising is what's happening with the middle class in that same period of time that is every single second, approximately five people leave poverty behind and join the middle class. Five people per seconds. That folks means that if this rate continues in just 12 years, by the year 20, 30, the middleclass, who would make up the vast majority of the world's popular

Speaker 2:          05:05          good

Speaker 1:          05:10          use. Wouldn't you agree? The middle class would mean a world with fewer poor people with a greater commitment to academic studies and knowledge with a greater tendency to set up companies and also a population that's more demanding towards politicians. Among other things. This is because the middle class is a proprietary class. People in the middle of class, they have houses, they have savings businesses, and that of course it leads them to be more committed to stability and to be more demanding. Not only that, as we've told you many times, this huge growth means another thing, hundreds of thousands of opportunities for enterprise. Now, hold on just a moment and here's the question that many of you may be asking yourselves and we know you're asking it because we see asking in the comments and that is, can our weld support so many consuming such a large amount of stuff? Aren't we really sowing the seeds of our destruction? Well, let's see a path to the abyss. Climate Change, mass extinction, water pollution. Folks, I don't even have to say, uh, we are facing many challenges. In fact, if we take a look at the news, we could get the impression that we're heading full speed towards some sort of precipice and of course with so many people consuming more and more resources, it's normal for our lives to be pervaded by the question of what's going to happen to the planet.

Speaker 1:          06:41          But what if it wasn't exactly like that? What if after a certain level, the relationship between the environments and wealth actually became positive? Well, folks, that's the direction that things are actually moving. See, when we talk about development and economic growth and consumption to issues logically concern us a lot. One is pollution and damage to the environment, and the second is whether or not there's going to be enough resources for everyone. So let's start with the first one first. Is it possible that things aren't going to go down such a bad path? Let's take a look. For example, what happens in recent years in the largest economies on the planet, so that is the United States, the European Union, China and Japan.

Speaker 2:          07:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:26          Nineteen, 63. Nineteen states issued zero point nine, four kilograms of co two for every dollar of production in 2014. This value was just point three four, which is 64 percent less for, it's called the European Union reduced co two emissions per dollar of production by 54 percent between 1991 and 2014. And the same is true of Japan, even China or infamous China, the country that used coal for everything has reduced its relative co two emissions by 75 percent over the past four decades. That is to say technological developments. And New environments or concerns are helping the world produce more policing. Last,

Speaker 2:          08:09          yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:09          You heard the absolutely right. Improved technology and increasing concern for the environments are managing to slow down and even reverse the damage to our planet's. Take a look at the United States,

Speaker 4:          08:23          Dannon, again, environmental improvements once deemed impossible have taken place since 1970 when the environmental protection agency was established. United States has slashed. It's a missions have five air pollutants by almost two thirds over the same period. The population grew by more than 40 percent and those people drove twice as many miles and became two and a half times Richard Steven pinker.

Speaker 1:          08:45          The truth, folks is that it's becoming increasingly clear that the relationship between the environments and wealth has an inverted u shape. That is to say after a determined level of wealth, societies begin to worry more about the environments. They begin to take measures to take care of it, and they begin to develop and use clean technologies. Renewable energies will dominate the future German electricity sector thanks to the impulse of offshore wind and geothermal. For example, this is what the environmental performance index an index constructed from metrics that measure the quality of our water forest and natural inhabitants indicates out of the 180 countries that make up the index, but to have improved in the last decade. On the other hand, the index shows that the richer a country is on average, the cleaner it's environments becomes. There's more environmental awareness and so it gets better results. Sure.

Speaker 1:          09:39          I mean, if we think about it, it's really quite logical. Richer countries can allocate more resources towards technological developments and protecting natural areas. In fact, since 1990, as the world has become richer and richer, protected areas have almost doubled. Today, more than 15 percent of the surface of the planet is protected, and not only that, the forestation, one of the great ecological threats is undergoing a clear decline deforestation for the world's largest tropical forest. The Amazon peaked in 1995 and from 2004 to 2013, the rate fell by four fifths. Steven pinker, when the laundry middle class will mean more resources to care for the environment, more people developing cleaner technologies and a greater level of environmental awareness. Now, don't get me wrong, there are many challenges ahead, but the trend isn't nearly bad as often portrayed, but we don't really need to take our foot off the gas. We do need to promote cleaner production methods and technologies, but we're not in an apocalyptic or irreversible situation. Bands, of course, the empirical evidence tells us that the best way to overcome these challenges is with more investments ends with richer and better formed societies. Regarding the second question as to whether natural resources will be exhausted on Austin, I think we can rest assured that they won't be not so many because there are many resources, but above all, because human activity aims to seek better ways of production, including recycling the development of new technologies that allow for the exploitation of new resources for the managed to do more. With

Speaker 1:          11:11          all of these reasons, and don't worry, we're going to talk much more about this topic in the future. I think we have to be more than satisfied that for the first time in the history of humanity, our average condition isn't poverty or hunger.
