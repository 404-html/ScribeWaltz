Speaker 1:          00:06          Oh, France, the country where the far right wing as it is known today, was born way before the financial crisis, way before Donald Trump, the game, the presidents of the United States way before breakfast, and the uprising of xenophobic parties in Europe. Way before all of that, France have an extreme nationalist party, the National Front, and this had a real chance to winning on the light.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:33          Julie, in 2002, the rest of the political players in the country from the left to the sense of rice had to join forces just to keep it from becoming the president of France. In April, 2017 French people are going back to the voting stations. A lot of people think that this is the ultimate chance for the far right wing in France. The moments where the national front with Marine Le Pen as its leader can get the presidential office once and for all, if this was the case of Marine Le Pen, who by the way is the daughter of Marine Le Pen, has promise that she will do everything she can. So you take a country out of the European Union, but not only that, France is the second largest country in continental Europe. Victory for the extreme rights would be a triumph for all far right parties.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Consonants

Speaker 1:          01:24          do. Just wait one minute because the question is really, does Marine Le Pen have a real chance of winning this election? Is there anyone out there who could possibly stop her? Today? We are going to answer all of these questions and we're going to get to know in depth history of the French extreme. Write a story that includes wars, ego clashes,

Speaker 3:          01:44          well playmates. So let's get into it

Speaker 1:          01:50          and clap. The French. Extreme rights has to ideological grandparents, adult pit. My ends theo a s as you know, during World War Two, the Germans invaded the north of France, the south, the so called free zone, who's capital was vishy, was governed by French politicians being supported at the German national socialism. When the war ends in the new president general Charles de Gaulle executed the main officials from vishy. But do wait one minute again, because there were many people who supported this collaborationist government people even without having political power, it held the same principles, ends the same ideals as the national socialists for Nazi Germany. Many of them were in the army up in 1961 the French. So that's their most precious colony. Algeria, old, a self determination referendum. As you can imagine, this was not great news for all of those far right extremists inside the French army. This is how the OAS was born. The oes was a terrorist group. His main goal was to ends the Algeria and attempt to the independence.

Speaker 3:          02:55          We are not terrorists. Do you understand? We have Patrick. I would do what you used to the soldiers who died fighting in Algeria and do the 3 million French citizens. What? What was it there?

Speaker 1:          03:05          So did they succeed? Well actually no. In 1962, Algeria became a sovereign state. And then the OAS change their goals and trying to kill the French president himself. They thought that the goal was a traitor to France. Fortunately though, in 1965, the French police dismantled the last cells of this group, just like what happens after the end of World War II, they jailing the hardliners didn't mean there were no people supporting the general court.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          03:34          The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has a large amounts of people who hated the Algerian and to have for the Third Reich, and this was the foundation that Joel Marine Le Pen used to bills. Ten years later, the National Front's, so you only talk about the war over and over everyday we're reminded of what was the war, the persecution of the Jews, the excessive behavior of the occupying forces. And so on. The beginning of this policy was no easy thing. During the 19 seventies, the National Front's would never get more than five percent of the votes, and Marie Le Pen himself suffered a terrorist attack at his own house. Now, this though is when the really good pot stocks in 1977, that was the Le Pen family inherited from a fellow support and entire palace.

Speaker 1:          04:27          It was the palace. Soon this would become the unofficial headquarters for the National Front, or as we probably could just say the lappin family. Yes. My friends with this policy, everything does stay in family drama, reorganized all those electoral campaigns that need and the third biggest political force in France at the end of the 1980, while his daughter Marine Le Pen was following him and learning the secrets as the art of politics in order to become the leader that she is today. Lisa, his granddaughter, Mary, on the pen, would follow him too, and she is now an MD in French Polynesia and a rising star in the national front. Interestingly though, even though his party congratulates in as the champion of family values, Le Pen's family is far from a happy one. Yes, yes. I didn't know here visual politic. We really don't like to gossip about anyone, but in this case, it's kinds of absolutely necessary to understand the political life.

Speaker 1:          05:24          As I said in the 19 eighties zone Marine Le Pen, who we will now called Le Pen senior, was on fire in every election. He was getting more and more votes than the previous one. It was during this time that he decided to hiring journalists to write his own biography, and of course you know this random list palace, so can you guess what this journalist did? Well, he probably can't unless you already know he seduced Le Pen's wife. Oh, but it's not just that these lovers then runaway from the palace, and then months later, Mrs Levin was on the cover of French Playboy magazine, and this is how the whole world discovered the more sensible side of the experience

Speaker 2:          06:09          right

Speaker 1:          06:19          now. This caused a split in the family. No matter how good the father was dealing in the elections, his daughter still agree with more and more distant from him, but the real turning point in the law and family would come in the year 2002. This was a year when France happened. Presidential elections and for the first time in history or Le Pen went to the second round. Now, as you might know, the French Alex oral system has two routes. When you're choosing presidents in the first rounds, they can choose from all of the candidates, however many that may be, and in the second round you can only vote for the two most successful candidates in the first rounds, well in 2002, the ones who made it into the second round was Jacques Chirac from the Center Right Wing Party and Lapan senior from the extreme

Speaker 2:          07:02          right

Speaker 1:          07:08          now you might be wondering how did it happen to do it too, right wing candidate. All the new rules in France. Well, during the easiest Le Pen learned an important lesson in politics. The idea of the captain boats out. I thought that this is going to find some principles of the party attractive no matter where they stand on the political spectrum, but ben stood for protectionism, French companies, but also for French workers. Do you remember the America first thing that trump was going on about? Well, it turns out that's not. Trump's invention was used buying the pen in the 19 nineties, so incidentals and into industrial cities, like I'll say, who used to be left wing strongholds voted for the national front. Yes, and this is why in that second rounds, boozy remains loyal to the social democratic party, had to swallow their pride and vote for Chirac and the center reits candidates, I mean anything was better than the uprising of a racist, extreme conservative. Likely the Penn family learns a second important lesson in politics. It is not only important to be accepted by your own voters, you also can't be too scary to the other people. If your opposition are too frightened, they might join forces to prevent you from getting into that presidential palace

Speaker 1:          08:28          versus Sean Murray versus Merry Christmas was not a great time for the family. After 2000 and see, Marine Le Pen started out internal campaign against a father. Now if again, Jo Marie Le Pen was a politician that ran for elections with statements like this

Speaker 2:          08:45          to

Speaker 1:          08:45          be an authority always, and we believe that in a household, the best one to have this authority is the mat. Nonetheless, Marine Le Pen was a women ready, have authority and modernize a political party that would honestly make windows 95 looked like a piece of state and beyond software. Now, unlike the other marine supported gay civil unions and was against the death penalty, even National Front voters could appreciate these changes and this is why in 2011 or the pen Jr took her father's place as the party's leader, but do not think that things were that easy. I wonder what motivated marine and her deputy is in this offensive. They have launched against me. It's just that joint. Just think about it when you've been the founder and the leader of a French far right political party for 39 years, it's not going to be easy taking orders from your daughter.

Speaker 1:          09:34          So even though today's y'all, Marie Le Pen is the honorary president of the National Front, he also votes as an independence at the European Parliament. I campaigned not from a renal Le Pen, but for Joan Marie Le Pen and I want 33 percent and guess this main supporter inside of the family. Surprise, surprise. Family business. Again, it says granddaughter, married Le Pen who is starting her own battle against her arms. Murray, he's a provocateur, an nt conformist. And it isn't always nice to hear. Meanwhile, marines moderation in combination with the end of the crisis in France all working way better than the radical strategies have a fall back. I consider Europe has made a mistake in the past. They should've started cooperation and development relationships with Africa this way they would have fixed the people in their own countries. In fact, the latest holsters for this 2017 election give her close to 25 percent of the vote. This makes sense. The first or second biggest candidates, and in an election with five candidates, 25 percent is a big thing. It is always certain that she will make it into the second round, but do consider that just because she is less radical than her father. This doesn't mean that marine is a moderate. In fact, far from it,

Speaker 1:          10:55          they missed 144 points of our electoral manifesto. Lappin dreamier stands for closing frontiers of massive deportations, the exit of the European Union, the return of the French currency, the same economic views as Vladimir Putin. This is true, but this is nothing new either. All right, so enough. You're probably now wondering. Well, Cam lappin actually become the next president of France, so let's address this question with another question. Can Stop for years. The center right wing in France, Taliban, good steal them, but yes, it is true that a big share of the National Front's votes come from the left wing, but in a time of crisis, family values and anti immigrant sentiments are particularly attractive to conservative voters. So in 2016, the big party of the center writes, the Republicans chose a candidate. We also put forward some of the proposals that made famous viceman was Francois. So is the strategy working well? Apparently not since finial became the party's candidates, the Republicans have been falling on the polls and they are now fighting for third position with the far right wing party of Luke Menand, shore corruption, sex scandals, and the fact that people prefer the original to the copy. This has caused failure and the center right to fall into it,

Speaker 1:          12:26          but there is still hope. The battle is not over. There is still a man who could be ready to stop. Le Pen's hurricane. His name is Emmanuel macron and he was the finance minister during the governments of Manwell vowels. Alright, so is Emmanuel macron a socialist? Elmo macron is running in the elections as an independent, even manual vowels himself. Didn't support him in public until relatively recently. So what does Emmanuel macron stand? Basically he stands for the opposite of

Speaker 1:          13:03          Macron, wants to ends the privileges and subsidies that French companies guess he wants to end the barriers that made it impossible for the French youth to get a job. And of course he is against discrimination based on race or religion when it comes to the economy. He wants to be a champion for deficit reduction as fiscal responsibility. Bam does. If that was not enough, one of his proposals is to forbid high ranking officials, do employee their own family in salina be administration. So as you can see is the antithesis of Marine Le Pen and surprise surprise, the latest polls actually indicate that he is slightly more popular than Marine Le Pen. We'd like the 25 percent of the expected and all of this despite being an independence. So he has a high chance of being the person that Le Pen will face in the second round, maybe not because there is a last variable that we must consider and that's extension. Even if macron has a lot of supporters, they are simply not as motivated as those from the Japan side. So for example, if during the second rounds, the National Front could retain 90 percent of their boats and macron could only retain 40 or 50 percent, he would have great difficulty winning the presence.

Speaker 2:          14:18          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          14:24          but I mean this is just our opinion and visual politic and we would love to hear yours. Do you think macron can be in the pen in France?
