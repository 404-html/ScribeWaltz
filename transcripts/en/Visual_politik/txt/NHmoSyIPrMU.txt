Speaker 1:          00:07          Transylvania, it's like Castlevania with vampires. Yes. You heard that writes the lands where Dracula was born is also the place of one of the most significant separatists conflicts in all of Europe. In other words, Transylvania. Well, it is the perfect place to make a visual politic Halloween's special and yes, yes, yes. We do read your comments. We do know that you want to add about Castlevania and I tell you what, we are working on it. It's going to be big. It's going to be complicated and it's also going to be worth the waste, I promise. Just sit tight for Catalonia, but for now, let us get back to Transylvania, which is a historical region located in the center of Romania. Dislike being in Romania. Twenty percent of its population doesn't even speak Romanian. Instead, their mother language needs to be Hungarian.

Speaker 1:          00:58          In some areas. The number of Hungarian speaking people rises to 80 percent. This area where the Hungarians are, the majority is cooled. The CICA landscape almost every year you can see the massive protests of Zika, least demanding more autonomy for the territory. These demonstrations are celebrated in the main cities. Transylvania as well as Bucharest, the Romanian capital and Budapest, the Hungarian capital, but let's hold on for just a minute because things are more complicated than they seem in facsimiles. Don't want to have their own country. Instead, they wanted to become a special region instinct of Romania with a very specific fiscal system. So the question here is, well, why does this cause so many problems for a while? All these demands creating such a significant diplomatic conflicts as well. More importantly, the question is, what does the Hungarian governments have to do with this? Well, don't worry because today, well, of course they're going to answer all of these questions, but as usual, before we do all of that, let's go back and take a look at the history. Hairy tongue. It's like for centuries, Transylvania, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Back then it wasn't even a country. The upper classes and aristocracy spoke Hungarian and Romanian. It was the language spoken by the present.

Speaker 2:          02:12          Yes,

Speaker 1:          02:14          points in history. Romanian speakers. What you've been prosecuted by the authorities. We call this process the mega ization. Basically these Hungarian rule, they wanted to impose their culture at any cost to is rs two grants. Romanians were sort of hillbillies, so you had a special love, the stealing things and a bad sense of personal hygiene. In fact, there was even a term to refer to these Romanians. They were called at Zurich and yell view. This literally means with a hairy

Speaker 2:          02:39          hum.

Speaker 1:          02:44          So during the 19th century, the government closed radian speaking newspapers and they even forced a lot of citizens do change their Romanian name to re Hungarian one just like this. Well, after World War One things, they really changed the Austrian Hungarian empire and lost the war. And one the things that happens when you lose a war is you usually lose a part of your territory. One of those parts, well that was Transylvania, which was incorporated into Romanian. Suddenly these peasants that were oppressed by the Hungarian ability that they have power and that power, well they wanted revenge and this is how the first attempts to destroy the Hungarian culture. Well, that's how they started. Well, it certainly wasn't an easy job. Do not forget that despite being a part of Romania, Transylvania was the home of over 1 million Hungarian speaking people. These people, they were called the weeklies and for generations they had been speaking the language of Istvan Orkney, but things they got a whole lot uglier during world war two, Hungary, well, they once again chose the wrong side to ally with with Hitler Elb. They took it back to their former territories and struck back against though you see wanted to erase Hungarian culture in the country. As you might imagine. This helps to make the Romanians even more angry. Then in 1945, well the Germans, they lost the war. That meant, of course, that the allies also lost and that included the Hungarians. So Romania with a brand new communist governments. Well, they took Transylvania back this time though. They had an even bigger taste for payback.

Speaker 1:          04:23          So maybe you remember this other video where I told you about the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu if you've seen it, you already know that the communist Romania. Well, it was the closest thing to a European North Korea that existed. One in every 30 Romanians was a part of the political police and so they prosecuted not only those who oppose the government, but even those you dare to speak Hungarian from one day to the other, Ceausescu close newspapers and forced those chilies to speak Romanian, even in their own

Speaker 2:          04:51          heights,

Speaker 1:          04:56          major realization, bad as it was forced a few Romanians to change their names. Romanization was the same sort of thing, just on a way bigger scale, but hold on for just a moment because it still doesn't stop here on their path to destroy even the last resemblance of Hungarian culture. The Romanian Communist Party forced thousands of citizens do you set up in the Hungarian speaking territories this way? Hungarian speaking became a small minority in cities like or daycare or Saturday morning, basically the whole area, the borders with Hungary came a Romanian majority region this via all of this. That is a region that did manage to keep their language and traditions in taxes alone. We mentioned earlier, if the so called secret lab

Speaker 2:          05:40          mania

Speaker 1:          05:41          steals from us, so in 1991, Romania, it past this brand new democratic constitution. The constitution recognized the invite to speak Hungarian, but as you can imagine, after decades of hate against Budapest, those seekers will. They were far from happy. I mean fiscally Romania. It's a very centralized country. Almost all the taxes are collected by the central government and then they share that money among the regions with a focus on the poorest. Once this boots Transylvanian in a pretty bad position, that's because, well, they are one of the wealthiest regions

Speaker 1:          06:25          and so. Well this is how a new political party was born and that would be the Democratic Alliance if I'm Gary, eons of Romania also known as Udm. All on surprisingly they want. All the elections in the regions were Hungarians are the majority so well. What are their foundations? Well, basically they claim that Romania is essentially sucking their lifeblood. That money. Yeah. It's pretty much the same situation as in Catalonia and their solutions. You end this Romanian losing is imitating the fiscal model or they'd another Spanish region and that would be the Basque country. Unlike other regions, the bast citizens don't pay their taxes to Madrid, but to their local government

Speaker 1:          07:05          collected, the local government has to give some share to the central government, but the rest is to be managed the way the local government wants. So this was the system that was proposed by the seekers in 2014. Guess what? The Romanian government replies, well, they said it was against the constitution. There are any constitution starts off by saying that it is a sovereign, unitary and Indian visible country. Now, of course this is something that created a whole lot of protests and a whole lot of different cities. There were a referendum attempts and all sorts of other symbolic objections, and these are all things that really just the Romanian ruling class, manias ruling party threatens autonomy seeking Transylvanian Hungarians with printers and punishment. Attempts that threatened the constitutional order of Romania should be punished with prison. If you've been following the case of the Catalonian separatists, well this might sound pretty familiar to you, but hold on just a second because one of the best. It's yet to come. Autonomy or annexation, if any of you have ever been hungry, I'm sure you might've seen someone wearing this tee shirt with this map. It represents the shape of hungry before losing a part of that territory's before World War One. Yeah. Even today in the 21st century, a lot of fun, Gary, and keep dreaming about taking that old empire back and among them you'll find the presidents of Viktor Orban, the Vladimir Putin.

Speaker 2:          08:27          You just

Speaker 1:          08:30          like the Russian president. Orban is famous for prosecuting journalists who dare to criticize him. He has passed anti gay laws and he wins elections with 60 percent of the votes and of course like every year to Putin. Orbin likes to rule not only his own country, but others too or bonds supports the autonomy of the CSI. Kelly's. Alright. Alright. Alright. I know what you're thinking. Why does a president from another country missed with the internal politics of another? I mean at the end of the day what the seekers wanted just to have more autonomy but without leaving Romania. Right? Well, in fact they're senior citizens are also his citizens

Speaker 1:          09:07          grants citizenship rights to ethnic Hungarians abroad. Yeah, you heard that, right? All of those Transylvanian born Hungarians, they have two passports. They have the right to study in Hungary, and of course they get to vote in Hungarian elections. This last thing, oh, it's pretty good for urban. I mean he's popular in suite of Hungarian borders, but outside he absolutely steals the show. Ninety five percent of Hungarians from abroad voted for his party at the latest legislative elections. Meanwhile, Romania considers these rights for the seekers as a complete violation of that sovereignty. In their opinion. If you voted to different countries, you can't be loyal to the one where you live. All this means that diplomatic relations between Hungary and Romania, pretty darn complicated, thanks to this open can use Romania as an antagonist to his nationalist propaganda and then Romania where it gets a great chance to give some shit to Hungary when it comes to European politics. So now this probably leads you onto the question of, well, what's the European Union? Think about all of this. The truth is, despite the Council of Europe writing memorandums, would they defend the rights of ethnic minorities? Brussels would never let Hungary when at the end of the day, Viktor Orban is like the Dracula Frankenstein and Freddy Kruger of European politics, so as long as things don't turn ugly, don't expect any position from any EU institution or politician

Speaker 1:          10:33          is what we think our official politic and now we'd love to know what you think. Do you think Transylvania should have its own autonomy or perhaps this is nothing. This attempts by hungry to get some sway back on that form it territories. Well, leave your answers in the comments section below. We would love to hear from you.
