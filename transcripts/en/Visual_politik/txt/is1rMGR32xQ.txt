Speaker 1:          00:00          In recent times, the meetings between the U, s presidents and European leaders, they've become quite tense. Did I say summit, which took place in early July of 2018 has been pretty good proof of that since it's up. Some questions on the table is Donald trump writes, when criticizing his European partners, all the European Nato countries taking advantage of the United States saw me and perhaps most importantly, should Europe have an Ami. Well, this up, if one thing has become very clear is that Donald Trump isn't too fond of these European leader meetings. I mean how bothersome it is to have to meet with all of these people. I a poor old trump. If they were at least as fun as Vladimir Putin or Kin Jong, I mean finning. It'd be different. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:00          It's an honor to be with you.

Speaker 3:          01:02          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Is that the clash between the US administration and most European governments extends to virtually all issues economy, trade, immigration and defense.

Speaker 2:          01:14          NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations, but 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they're supposed to be paying for their defense.

Speaker 1:          01:29          See, the US president has been criticizing NATO for years due to the alleged lack of involvement of the European partners. Spin back to the US president has been saying things like that for almost 20 years.

Speaker 4:          01:43          It has no vital interest in Europe. There are conflicts are not worth American lives. Pulling back from Europe would save this country millions of dollars annually. Donald trump in 2000.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Of course, it isn't just about the tenants of the White House. The truth is that in recent decades, the differences between Europe and America have expanded, for example, of this baseball versus soccer and appreciation for cars with gigantic engines. One can tell where the gas must be cheaper, right? It's also the way in which weapons are considered in all fields. Even in defense, the army and the military are very, very important issues in us politics, but over in Europe, not so much and it's even worse than not so much. In fact, these humps even frontpage issues and they're certainly not very popular prompts. That's why since the Cold War ended, the military spending of European countries that belonged to NATO has collapsed in terms of GDP ranging from something a little over three percent to less than one point five in Europe. Military spending, it just doesn't sell, and this view is is greatly angered Washington's politicians in recent years and in this matter, we're not only talking about Donald Trump, but also you, Barack Obama and George W dot Bush, their own visual politic. In a previous video we told you why isn't such a good idea for European countries? Do you spend more money on weapons, but hold on just a minute. What if Washington was actually right? Now listen up.

Speaker 1:          03:14          If Washington was right, here's a question for you, and as I always say, please don't google it because that's cheating. Do you know how many soldiers the European NATO countries have in total? Well, they'll tell you it's approximately one point 8 million soldiers. However, if this number only 30 percent can be deployed in the case of a conflict and only 50 to 100 thousands can be deployed sustainably and for greater lengths of time, and folks in general, the European armies, they've got many operational problems. Yup, it's true. They do spend a lot of money, but their governments, most of them don't really care very much about the results. We can. For example, look at Germany, a country that in 2017 had a military budget of approximately $45,000,000,000. That is, it has one of the top 10 largest military budgets of any country. Well, despite being one of the countries with the largest military budget a couple of years ago, a study by the consultancy firm Mckinsey for revealed that almost 60 percent of Germany's Eurofighter and Tornado fighter aircrafts and 80 percent of them, most modern helicopters were not ready for combat due to a lack of maintenance updates and supplies.

Speaker 1:          04:29          At the end of 2017, a parliamentary investigation showed quite a similar results, not one of the submarines and none of the 14 main transport planes of the German air force or even operational, not a single one, and we're not even exaggerating. Even a document from the German Ministry of Defense warns that the soldiers didn't have enough protective vests when to clothes or tents to participate in any important NATO mission, and believe me, it's not just Germany. For example, during the war in Libya, despite being a relatively small conflicts, just three weeks after the attacks began, the European air forces began to run out of precision weapons and other words. Governments spend large amounts of money on weapons programs and they've had many soldiers, but that doesn't really matter when it comes to the day to day operations. And that's how we ended up with news like this.

Speaker 4:          05:27          The Legion declares all out war on obesity. The elite unit of the Spanish infantry launches a plan to combat obesity among its members.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Honestly, because that's not the worst of it. Perhaps what annoys the US offices, the most of the rules with which some of the European armies have entered combat under NATO. For example, in Afghanistan. See many European governments don't want to assume any kinds of risks, so they ordered them military commanders to maintain this soldiers away from the front. In the case of the Afghan campaign, for example, US soldiers sharing testimonies in which they were denied medical evacuation by Europeans because they were in a combat zone, wasn't strange. Listen to this.

Speaker 4:          06:08          Ghana's Stan year 2008. We were returning from a mission. When a rocket hit the vehicle that was in front of mine, our Humvee was suddenly being attacked by machine gunfire. Of the 11 vehicles that entered the ambush area for left inoperative and a fifth one was destroyed over. Boys had died and it doesn't. We're wounded. We were six hours away by car from our base. It was getting dark and the Taliban were still attacking us. When we call to ask for a medical evacuation, they asked us if the landing area was so hot. We said yes, we were being attacked. That moment of voice with a foreign accent told me that their rules prevented them from providing us assistance. He asked me if we could secure the landing area or if we can move minutes turned into hours and the Taliban continued attacking us. Then out of nowhere a voice came up on the radio. It was American. A couple of Black Hawk helicopters from a totally different mission had heard our help call. The pilots deviated immediately. Within 15 minutes they landed in her wounded were evacuated. Our superiors told us that the NATO country who is responsible for medical evacuations had a rule that prevented them from intervening, instill hot areas. We were furious. Elliot Ackerman, a veteran who served in the Afghanistan Marine special operations core.

Speaker 1:          07:21          Just a second, because this is really important in Afghanistan alone, nearly 900 European soldiers who have lost their lives. We're talking about political orders that don't happen in all cases, but which are very common. I know it's not a matter of money. It's a matter of commitment. Every year the European NATO countries spend almost $300, billion dollars that is together. They have the second largest military budget after the United States.

Speaker 3:          07:48          It's

Speaker 1:          07:56          flight of this in Washington. They want European NATO countries do substantially increase the military spending and that's where the magical two percent of the GDP figures up here.

Speaker 3:          08:05          Yes,

Speaker 4:          08:14          the two percent milk

Speaker 1:          08:18          as he made very clear at the last NATO summit, Donald trump is furious. According to the vast majority of the countries of the Atlantic alliance, they're late in their quota payments. Check this out.

Speaker 4:          08:29          Many countries in NATO which we are expected to defend or not only short of their current commitment of two percent, which is low, but are also delinquent for many years and payments that have not been made, will they reimburse the US?

Speaker 1:          08:42          Well, one of two is true. Either he's saying this because he has no idea or are you saying it because he wants some electoral points. Spa, of course fooling the Veritas because let's be clear, this entire payments thing has no point of reference. Two percent is a military spending objective from each country for its own army that has nothing to do with NATO payments or anything like that. That is if a country spends less, it doesn't own anything to NATO, the United States or anyone else for that matter. The fact is that in 2014, after a lot of pressure, Barack Obama managed to get the European NATO countries to commit to substantially increasing the military budget to reach two percent of their GDP by 20, 24 and precisely due to that commitment. Europe is the region of the world where military spending is increasing the most. Check this out.

Speaker 5:          09:34          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          09:39          Yes. You know that later, trump and especially his supporters will say that this was all thanks to him to his magnificent negotiating skills. However, even if military spending increases, it probably won't actually change anything first. This two percent figure it's a random number which could be reached simply by raising military salaries or cheating in all kinds of other ways. Greece, for example, is one of the few countries that complies with this and it spends two point three, six percent of its GDP, but a large part of that budget is used to pay the military pensions and even most of their investments in military equipment is geared towards defense against hockey, which is another NATO member country as a result of this. Well, even though the expenditure rule is apparently being followed to the Greek army brings little or nothing to the organization's capabilities, but even though all of this money could be used to really improve the armies and of course without political commitments, it will never happen. Not much will be achieved anyway.

Speaker 1:          10:38          European countries will continue to depend on the United States for forced deployments because each country on its own wouldn't be able to afford to maintain that kind of global deployments. Intelligence and supply capabilities and of course given that in Europe, military operations on popular, neither the political commitments and all the rules friends are in combat will actually change. That is we would have larger armies, but at the moments of truth, very similar deficiencies. But also, let's consider something else. The armed forces can perform for essential functions, deterrents, intervention in deployments, occupation and cybersecurity for none of these tasks as the current European countries budgets a hindrance, two point terrorism, more quickly, deploy somewhere in the world and face a special situation. You don't really need multiple aircraft carriers. That is redundant forces. It's much more important to be able to deploy quickly and manage a conflict.

Speaker 1:          11:39          For example, there's the latest United States and NATO wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. In all of them. The military victory was simple, but the postwar period, it was an absolute disaster. Preparing forces to manage local and using the country's different institutions to train the national forces. Not only the military but also from the police trial courts, prisons, power plants, etc. Would probably have been a great deal more useful at the end of the day. VieW at facing of conflict requires a lot of things and not always the same ones. The threats we face today don't require re craft carriers or fighter bombers. They require agility. Europe doesn't need to spend more. It spends a lot. It just needs to spend better, and that's where the idea of the european army in that pascoe a european army, in december of 2017, the european union launched the pascoe program, need permanent structured cooperation. It's objective. While that would be coordinating the countries that participate in the program in terms of security, acquisition of war materials, and joint defense in peace operations. In other words, to begin integrating the various armed forces. The program is still in a very incipient phase and isn't considered the equivalent of a european army yet, however, this could be the best solution to all their problems.

Speaker 1:          13:04          The 25 countries that make up the program by integrating that armies that weapons purchases their training and even by sharing resources could mean for europe even while spending the last would have a modern well equipped army with great deployment capabilities.

Speaker 1:          13:21          After all, if a country like Spain spends a fortune buying leopard tanks, which happens and in practice due to a lack of means to deploy them, they only uses them to defend against Portugal. They've made a totally unnecessary expense. Wouldn't you agree, folks today? The risks and challenges, they're global, so I sincerely belieVe that europe needs more integration to do you think is data and seek to complete to the us. Military has contributions within the nato framework, but it's not achieved by spending more also almost $300,000,000,000 a year. It should be more than enough, but now it's your sound.
