Speaker 1:          00:07          The word brexit has become a synonym for apocalypse for most of media, at least the media outside of the UK. There are many things to be said about this, but today we're going to focus on this Goldman Sachs to move hundreds of its staff out of London, and this is just one example, but at the time we're making this video, 20 banks have already announced that they will move part of their staff out of the UK. The most optimistic estimations claimed that the city of London might lose over 30,000 workers and the most pessimistic argue that this could be as high as $200,000. But wait just a minute here. Why is this important? Well, if you've been following visual politic for a while, you already know that London is the global financial capital. More specifically that global financial capital would be the city of London, also known as the square mile. Square mile is essentially a city inside of a city where most of the international banks have their headquarters. Yes. Even after Brexit, it is possible that London will keep it sway on the markets in Asia and even America, but so far European business accounts for 35 percent of the city's workloads and of course leaving the European Union is going to have some consequences. While now you might be wondering, well, why are these banks going to go? Which city will be the new financial capital after London? Well, often monster competition. It does seem as if we do finally have

Speaker 2:          01:28          winner

Speaker 1:          01:33          and other companies plan expansion in Frankfurt after brexit. So far this is a Frankfurt is going to become the new financial powerhouse in Europe and perhaps one of the most important in the entire world, but what does Frankfurt's sap that other cities like Madrid or Paris don't? Well today we are going to answer this question, but before we do, let's look back at the history.

Speaker 3:          01:58          Why are banks leaving the city?

Speaker 1:          02:00          The city of London is an area of about a square mile. See where the name comes from, which is located inside broader London. They have their own laws. They have their own mayor. They even have their own police. Little bit

Speaker 3:          02:10          base is the home for the main international banks. Three hundred thousand people work here and have this 300,000, 60,000 European immigrants who entered the country thanks to being part of the European Union

Speaker 1:          02:22          and okay, my countrymen, I know where you're thinking. Despite being an EU country, the UK never was really insight. The free circulation area. This means that theoretically the British government could have closed the borders to all those immigrants sit anytime they want it, but in practice, European citizens we're getting in and out of the country as they pleased.

Speaker 4:          02:38          It's clear that EU migration to the UK has increased significantly over the last two decades. In Twenty 15, they were just over 3 million people living in the UK. You were born in other EU countries and increase of about one point 9 million since 2003. Nevertheless,

Speaker 1:          02:54          things they are getting exchanged for the questions to the prime minister, he British Prime Minister, conservative Theresa may hold, holds an extremely weak

Speaker 2:          03:03          position.

Speaker 1:          03:06          This is despite the fact that she won the general election in June, she just lost a large number of seats in the parliament doing that. In fact, it's not even clear if she's going to finish that time. Of course, people from in and out of their party, they are pushing her to increase immigration controls.

Speaker 5:          03:21          I've consistently said that the referendum vote was a vote for us to change that freedom of movement with a vote for us to bring control into our immigration system for people coming from the European Union. There's a variety of ways in which that can be done.

Speaker 1:          03:34          This would have a big impact in the city of London. Indeed, a bigger impacts than anywhere else in the UK. As we said in another video. Positive London success comes from their ability to attract talent from all over the wells, but if the government closes its doors to foreigners, those banks you hire immigrants will have it to significantly harder than before and make no mistake. This is not only due to brexit. In fact, the anti immigrant sentiment in the UK, it's been going well beyond the borders of the European Union.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Theresa

Speaker 1:          04:06          may discharge companies 2000 pounds per year for each non European Union worker they employ, but wasting it because there's still more, as I said, Theresa May and so Conservative Party have lost a good share of the seats in parliament as well. Where did those seats go? Well, they went to the Labor policy. A policy leader, Jeremy Corbyn has declared war on the backs on his election manifesto. He already proposed things like this for cultural UK financial transaction tax

Speaker 1:          04:40          until now. This tax was one of the biggest advantages that UK had over the EU. As you might know, Brussels has been for years debating the possibility of having a financial transaction tax. This is something bankers really don't wants and no one really wants to pay, but if the UK parliament ends up passing such a law, a lot of companies will be wondering if they still want to keep their offices in London. In other words, even if the brexit negotiations ended up being great for the UK interests, the ad is still becoming more and more poisonous for the UKS financial industry, and this explains why so many banks are starting to think about opening offices outside of the.

Speaker 2:          05:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Now the question is why are they choosing Frankfurt? Well, let's have a look at that financial capital. On the very day after the brexit referendum, the race to take over London as the global financial capital started, for example, in Spain, the regional governments of Madrid launched their own advertising campaign, designed to attract bankers, even the Finance Minister Luis held personal meetings with executives from jp Morgan and elsewhere to offer special tax conditions in Paris. Emmanuel macron had already announced lower taxes for banks in order to hinder them from London, but I'm sorry guys, it's really hard to beat the India. Frankly.

Speaker 6:          06:04          Standard Charter Plc,

Speaker 1:          06:06          Nomura Holdings Inc and Di was securities group Inc, have all picked Germany's financial capital for their EU base to ensure continued access to the single market. But if you want to stay wealthy, which would help us and fun food city group, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are weighing a similar decision. But what's so special about this city? Well, first of all, frank, that already has the headquarters of the European Central Bank as well as other big banks like Deutsche Bank. This means that they already have the network effects. We always mentioned here a visual politic. They have lots of other things like startups, law firms, consultancy, etc. Besides frankfurt has many business schools with international prestige as well as the university under the second biggest airport in europe, you know have in front foot like a form that chinese companies, we have like 800 turkish companies, 1000 companies from United States. Only the rate of the english companies is quite little. But this will change from my point of view automatically. If this was not enough, 70 percent of the german population speak english fluently. This means those british banks can send their managers to Frankfurt old international meetings and even hire locals without having to worry about language. If you think this is not important, good luck trying to find the same setup and France were only 39 percent of the population speaks. Shakespeare's language, not to mention Spain, where this percentage is lower than 25 percent.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Hold on a minute because there is still more, as I said in a previous video, Germany is a d at centralized country. This means regional governments and trade unions have way more autonomy here than they have in any other country. Thanks to this political architecture, the region of hessen where frankfurt is. Locators can offer things like this.

Speaker 3:          07:57          Labor laws make it difficult to fire people. Frankfurt had initially proposed a change in labor laws that would either exempt bankers or high income earners more generally from the rules.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Okay. Now let's think about something else. If you have a bank guns, he wants to set up your offices somewhere. What is the first thing you will need? Well, that would be a building. You need a physical place where you can put your offices. Well in this regard, frankfurt is better suited than anywhere else you see. After world war two, frankfurt, it was totally destroyed and they had to rebuild it almost nothing and other german cities, urban laws for the building of skyscrapers in order to maintain the uniform, more traditional skyline, but not in frankfurt. Here you can make buildings as high as you want.

Speaker 1:          08:43          This explains why despite a population of less than 1 million inhabitants, frankfurt looks like a big metropolis. Further, Germany asked one of the cheapest real estate markets in all of europe. Despite the high salaries, houses, rents square meters are half the price of paris and a fraction of the cost of london. Okay? Okay. But now I know what you're thinking. I mean, come on simon. What about corporate taxes and this is the most important thing of all. Well yeah, I know Germany has a corporate tax that in some cases reaches 30 percent by comparison. The uk is at 20 and you're absolutely right, but the devil here, it's really in the details. Do you ever. How I said the gemini is highly decentralized. Well, this applies to corporate tax to in this country, corporate tax. It's divided into two parts and national and a regional one. This means that the federal government's gets only 15 percent of the tax. The rest depends on the

Speaker 2:          09:32          region.

Speaker 1:          09:36          This means technically the state of hessen where frankfurt is really has the ability to reduce this tax a lot and of course doing this mice and more and more british bankers that I'm finally, if none of this was enough of you, here comes the big finale, the financial transaction tax. This was the tax bill you mentioned before. That scares away so many bankers. That tax, at least in europe, has about as many loopholes as possible. There are so many exceptions on this tax that Even its biggest supporter, the german finance minister had this to say humanist swiss cheese needs more than holes or has to be something in between them. Otherwise it's just a hole, not a swiss cheese. Wolfgang schauble.

Speaker 1:          10:19          So now we have a question for you. Imagine you are the manager of one of these london banks. What would you do?
