Speaker 1:          00:00          No, no. I don't think we can talk about the Caribbean without mentioning the Dominican Republic. It's a major tourist destination with the largest economy and even the highest mountain in all of the island countries in the Caribbean.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20          The Dominican Republic is a very, very special place in Latin America. I'm not only saying this because we can find amazing places such as Punta Cana by ib or Puerto Plata here among many, many others. I'm also saying it because this was the very first place where Christopher Columbus has men settled when America was discovered in 1492 yup. It's true for good or ill. Everything started here. This is where Latin America as we know it began.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52          It's capital. It's Santa Domingo was the first modern city on the entire American continent here. The first cathedral, the first university in the first hospital were belts, but yes, it's true. If we associate the Dominican Republic with anything, it's going to be tourism. The Sun Revolution.

Speaker 1:          01:19          This is by far the country's best face and not for nothing folks, the Dominican Republic, it's trendy thanks to its 1000 miles of coastline. More than 250 miles of amazing Caribbean beaches. It's golf courses and huge all inclusive resorts. The country is experiencing an impressive tourist banner. Of course, this is a story it has been developing for a while. See, during the 1940s the then plenipotentiary dictator of the island's general, Rafael Trujillo gave the order to encourage tourism. This was probably done with the intention of filling his pockets. That sounds the Malecon decentered Mingo in the first luxury hotel in the city. The hotel Harroway opens in 1944 years later in 1968 the first legislation that considered tourism development to be of national interest was approved. So as you can see, an emphasis on tourism, not exactly new.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:14          but in recent years, it has completely taken off. In 2017 the Dominican Republic or country with just over 10 million inhabitants managed to attract more than 7 million tourists so quickly that the country is expected to overcome the 10 million international tourists barrier in no more than three years. Course. As you can imagine, all of this, he's got consequences in the last five years. Foreign direct investment in the tourism sector has grown by more than 500% it's multiplied by six times. Nowadays the Dominican Republic is more than 80,000 hotel rooms and this number, it just doesn't stop growing.

Speaker 2:          02:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Give you an idea

Speaker 3:          03:00          to accommodate all these visitors. In 2017 Dominican hotels opened 8,366 new rooms and an additional 15,000 are under construction. Then needle Medina, president of the Dominican Republic.

Speaker 1:          03:16          The results tourism is already the island's main economic activity as if we take both the wealth this generates directly and deans I rags and into accounts. It means not one out of every four pesos generated by the economy from tourism. We could say that the Dominican Republicans can discovered and is beginning to exploit its peculiar type of foil and the truth is that in this area, it's almost all good news. Jack Out, one of their latest achievements which happens in exchange for breaking with Taiwan

Speaker 3:          03:43          People's Republic of China is opening up to Dominican tourism. The Chinese authorities have declared the Dominican Republic a tourist destination for all its citizens.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Of course we asked a moment because that's not it folks, the Dominican Republic, it's got a different face because here in this country we can find a lot of lights. We can also find a lot of shadows that we commonly see today in Latin America. So let's take a look at that.

Speaker 3:          04:14          The other face,

Speaker 1:          04:18          the Dominican Republic has achieved one of the highest growth rates in Latin America and the Caribbean in the last 25 years. This strong performances, actually men's achieving a higher purchasing power parity as well as one of the 10 highest per capita incomes in all of Latin America. I'd almost a $17,000 the Dominican Republic is paired with Costa Rica and to well above countries such as Peru, Colombia, or Ecuador. Hold on a second because that's not the whole story yet. In spite of everything, 32% of all dominicans, that is one in every three people live below the poverty line. The average life expectancy belly exceed 70 and infant mortality is almost five times higher than in developed countries.

Speaker 2:          04:58          Okay?

Speaker 1:          05:00          That may explain why we can find a one and a half million Dominican's in the United States and why often tourism we're missing says are the second largest source of wealth. But having said that, I think the question we can all ask ourselves as well, how can such a paradise not take off? Well, folks, the answer is that this Caribbean lambs has many of the evils that unfortunately are all over Latin America.

Speaker 2:          05:26          Okay? Yup, Yup.

Speaker 1:          05:31          The and modern history, it began here in 1492 now 526 years later, we can find a good reflection of the best and worst in Latin America in this exact same place, but delving into this mass of the first great points of darkness we can find is these stubborn persistence in keeping policies that have repeatedly been shown not to work. An issue that seems to reign in this region of the world. For example, in matters of informal work irregular, which is a serious problem that has spread throughout the region. See the workers who are exposed to the situation to in formality? Well, it comes up more precarious conditions with greater instability as well as having problems obtaining financing, whether that's to buy a house, invest in the business or properly educate their children. And of course they have lower wages. I mean this is pretty obvious because the company will invest less money in an employee who's hired irregularly, but this is also a problem for the governments. For example, when it comes to collect taxes,

Speaker 2:          06:31          smooth

Speaker 1:          06:35          one in the Dominican Republic in formal employment affects six out of every 10 workers in this country. Then I'm going to, it's not decreasing. It's growing in 2017 for example, formal jobs were only created in the public sector and well, what does this info tell us? While this is that formal hiring involves many barriers and many burdens. These can be bureaucracy, taxes, outdated regulations. These basically mean that people have to set up and pay taxes before they even make a single dollar and all that. Logically it makes it difficult for private economies do create policy jobs. So with this data in hands, I think it would it make sense to say, well, hey, we need a boost in formal hiring. Well, what's not working? But unfortunately it doesn't work like that. The same goes for commercial policy. You see in a country with a small local markets as is precisely the Dominican republics case, the foreign sector is absolutely essential. This seems pretty obvious, right? It's, well in this country we can basically find two different situations. On the one hand, there's the free zones where the companies in stalls have favorable conditions, both regulatory and fiscal, which they provide in exchange for basically only working in export swath meeting a certain criteria and is being approved by the government. On the other hand, they're raw of the more normal companies, which they're the vast majority, well, more than half of all exports come from the free zones. And additionally, in recent years, exports from these places have grown on average 5% every year.

Speaker 2:          08:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:05          Sports from common Dominican companies. Well, well check this out.

Speaker 2:          08:14          Sorry. So

Speaker 1:          08:15          upon seeing this, the question I ask myself is if the free zones work well, why not extend their benefits to the rest of the country so the Dominican companies can become more competitive? Well, unfortunately that's not going to happen either. But then there's the issues of the deficit, public spending and debts, which in spite of the great number of bad experiences continues to be a vice of many Latin American countries here. The Dominican Republic is also not an exception since 1990 public spending in the Dominican Republic has multiplied by 18 yeah. Public deficits. It's almost a tradition. No,

Speaker 1:          08:55          just hold on for maybe, because you might be wondering now. Well, it's all, I'm an only talking about a country that's coming out of poverty. I mean, there's lots to do. There's infrastructure that needs to be created, this ports, airports, roads. They all need to be built so that this country can grow. But do you know what type of expenditure grows this the most and no, it's not public investments. It's actually current expenditure, which is multiplied by almost 30 since 1990 and of course the expenses have to be paid partly with more taxes, which slows down the creation of formal jobs and investments and well, partly with debt checkout was happening with the Dominican debts, with the devs and interest because of course debts, the hands interest. Indeed almost one quarter of governmental spending goes towards paying interest. That's the third largest figure in all of Latin America. And it won't stop growing. Well, despite the tourism sector is take off this constant stubbornness with policies that don't work, explains why Dominican's have so many problems and why there is still so much poverty in this country. I mean, check out how this country ranks in the global competitiveness index.

Speaker 1:          10:12          And what about politicians? Are they involved in other things? And this is not because the shadows, they don't end here. There's a lot more suspicion.

Speaker 1:          10:32          The Dominican Republic is a fantastic country and it probably has a promising future. And wanting managers to take that big step, it really well be like a paradise. Think about it, good weather, good beaches ans money. It could possibly resist. However, today the Dominican Republic has two other very important problems that may be stopping the country from taking off and it's one of those is corruption. The Dominican Republic is among the 50 most corrupt countries according to Transparency International. Yeah. That ride, the Dominican Republic is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world according to Transparency International's ranking, Oni, Venezuela, Haiti, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in a worse situation in Latin America here, corruption at all levels is very common. Suspects range from the current socialist presidents, any limit. Dina who was accused of having finance does electoral campaign with bribes to the police themselves. In fact, it was in the Dominican Republic for the construction company. Oderbrecht in stalls is coordination, sends up for the bribes that it paid internationally in exchange for contracts, and of course, many of these bribes remains them almost a hundred million dollars as far as we know. These were received by politicians and officials in exchange for concessions, work awards and public contract. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          11:51          but unfortunately

Speaker 1:          11:52          that's not all. The other problem which is growing is drug trafficking. The Dominican Republic is considered one of the most important bridge countries and it's narcotics distribution centers by the United States. Drug traffickers have a problem exporting drugs from Venezuela. There are few commercial flights, little container shipping, no tourists and a collapsed fishing sector, but the Dominican Republic, 1400 kilometers away has it all. In fact, according to the dea ends, the European intelligence services nowadays, the Dominican Republic is one of the main transit countries for narcotics that go to the United States and the most frequent for cocaine shipments coming to Europe, and of course this is an important issue, but that's something we're going to talk about another day. In any case, let's be absolutely clear there are problems that unfortunately are common in the entire region. The Dominican Republic has achieved a lot in recent decades. It's certainly a fantastic place and it has a promising future.
