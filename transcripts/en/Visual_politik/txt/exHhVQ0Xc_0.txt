Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          Hollywood's it's the world's most famous neighborhoods spans. Yes, I said that. Absolutely right. Hollywood is a neighborhood. It's not a city. It's not even a village. Hollywood is a district inside the city of Los Angeles with a population of less than 90,000 people. Nonetheless, here is where most of the movie industry has concentrated. Wait just a minute because I know what you're going to say. Come on. Signer, and I know better than this. This isn't a tall tree. The biggest movie production centered. The world is Bollywood in India. Well my dear viewers, you up sort of right here, but there is a pretty significant, but now despite the fact that the Indian movie industry makes more movies than anyone of their income is tiny compared to that of Hollywood,

Speaker 2:          00:53          I think just think about it. How many Indian movies have you actually seen? I bet the answer to that is number or lost and undone less. Of course your Indian, in which case, hello, dear Indian viewers. Now with a few exceptions, Bollywood movies are made to the domestic market and the same goes for Nigeria. Nigeria is actually the second largest movie producer in the world behind Bollywood. But I'm sure hardly any of you have actually seen a film made in this country and you are of course in Nigerian, in which case, hello Nigerian viewers. So when it comes to the raw economics of it all, Hollywood is undoubtedly the world's movie capitol. So now you might be wondering, well, Simon, why are we talking about cinema here? A visual politic. Isn't this channel all about politics and economics? I mean, what's the connection here? Well, actually there are a lot of connection.

Speaker 2:          01:47          First there is the fact that there is a political reason why he's so much of the movie world is centered in Hollywood and the end of the day, I mean, why as Hollywood in Los Angeles and not in New York or London or somewhere else entirely. Now, many of you might think that California has always been an important state in the u s with innovative companies, prestigious universities and celebrities just walking down the street. But the truth is that at the beginning of the 20th century, La had less of an 100,000 inhabitants. In fact, the first movie producers were born on the other side of the country. Then cities like New York or Chicago. So the question we have to ask now is, well, why did they decide to move to la? What does Hollywood have the Manhattan doesn't? And the most important question of all, what does immigration have to do with any of this?

Speaker 2:          02:33          Well today we are going to answer all of those questions, but before we do as usual, let's take a look at the history art by and for immigrants. The first question of all when it has to be who invented movies in the first place? The Lumiere brothers, well, not exactly what the Lumiere brothers invented was the system to project films onto a big screen. But years before that the company of Thomas Edison had already discovered a system to record and play short movies and this was called a kinetoscope. It was a device where you would put a coin into a slot and watch movies through AP poll. He is later. This system would be improved so that these short films could be projected onto a big screen as well. But the big difference between Edison and the Lumiere brothers was that the American businessmen knew that these could make big time money.

Speaker 3:          03:31          Anything that won't sell, I don't want to invent it. Sale is proof of utility and utility is success. Thomas Alva Edison,

Speaker 2:          03:41          so while the Lumiere brothers showed off their invention at scientific fairs, Edison made a profit from it. His business consisted of selling these machines, taking a royalty for their use and supplying movie theaters with lots and lots of films. It just two decades, Edison made more than 1,200 movies. It's like now you might be wondering, what kind of movies did Edison produce? Well, as bizarre, more not as it possibly sounds as many of these first films in history were about women getting undressed, but movies were bigger opportunity and just a few years, cities like New York and Chicago became flooded with movie theaters. The so called Nickelodeon's. Here you find a great show at a lower price in another theaters. Plus, since the movies were silent, you didn't need to speak English to understand them. This means movies became the perfect entertainments for all the immigrants arriving to the lands of opportunity. All of this, it was happening in the first decade of the 20th century men's while France, since interestingly, Denmark already were producing that own movies. No other country had a bigger audience than America. How is that Thomas Edison? He wasn't able to see all of the opportunities behind his invention. At the end of the day, he was the typical wasp and d despised immigrants. Of course, he was happy to be money from them, but he didn't really like them and so now you might be asking, well, why didn't he invests money in improving the quality of his films? Well, at the end of the day, his company had a monopoly over the production and distribution of the films. It's like he really didn't have any incentive to

Speaker 3:          05:10          all those nickelodeon's paid royalties to Edison's company and bought his films without even looking at the titles are plots. At the end of the day, nobody thought those German, Italian or Hungarian immigrants would appreciate the details.

Speaker 2:          05:28          Of course, this was until this man you see on the screen right now came along. Of course I'm talking about call Lemley Emily. He was one of these German immigrants. He worked at a nickelodeon in Chicago business. It was great, but he was sick of paying so much money if they that a sense movies. So he asked himself the question wrong, can just, I make my own movies and as well, yes, he absolutely could. I, I'll say Lenley. He knew other nickelodeon owners. All of them were immigrants too, as they knew the tastes and aspirations of their audiences. They knew that movies, they could become something much more than just cheap jokes and girls with not very many clothes. They could create stars like those seen on Broadway.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:22          These cinema pioneers were the first ones to include the actor's name on the posters and in the credits this way, many more artists were willing to work for them. Their films became famous among immigrants who came. They came from all over the worlds, and this is why they named their company universal.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:43          As you can imagine, the success of this new company, they didn't spot others to follow suit, for instance, and other Hungarian immigrants named adults. Zucker made another partnership with other nickelodeon owners. Zahn started another studio, which was called paramount pictures, southernly New York, and in general, the east coast became sort of the primitive version of Hollywood. The hold on for just a minute because Thomas Edison, well, he was not willing to lose this battle. Don't forget, he had the fame, the money, am's, the patterns. So in less than five years, Lemley and his partner's feast over 200 lawsuits. The same happens with the rest of the small studios and as well, many of them went bankrupt. Oh yeah. This was a pretty bad side. The movie studios is bad. It was pretty much a golden era for lawyers, and if all of this was not enough, Edison had enough power to force all of the nickelodeons from New York and Chicago to sign exclusivity contracts. If they wanted Addison's technology, it couldn't buy movies from his rivals. Well, this is the moment when our friend called Lemley, asked himself another important question, well, why should they stay on the east coast? Addison, he was a powerful man in ds, but it's influence didn't reach everywhere. There was a place far out of his reach and that place it was California

Speaker 2:          08:16          birth of an industry. In the end, 90 15 California, there was the place to be thousands of young immigrants. The perfect audience for these would arrive every year. Houses and properties were cheaper than anywhere else in America. And as if this was not enough, if the weather was pretty fantastic in New York, it rains a ray of the day. So if you wanted to make movies, you'd better have a studio and spend thousands of dollars on lights. In California, there's plenty of sunshine all year round, so it's really easy to shoot outside. This is why all those big studios from New York and Chicago moved into a neighborhood on the outskirts of Los Angeles, a small with less or more than 500 inhabitants. And as you've probably guessed by now, well that tiny place, it was Hollywood,

Speaker 2:          09:05          but the story, it doesn't end here. You might now be wondering, well, how did California conquer audiences all around the world? I mean, don't forget that back in the day that United States, it wasn't the big powerhouse that it would become later. And don't forget, countries like France, countries like Denmark, they already had a well funded industry. So why did Hollywood achieve so much success and do it so quickly? Well, the answer lies in something called the network effects, and if you've been subscribed to this channel for a while, you should do that by the way, then the chances aren't even know what this thing is.

Speaker 3:          09:36          All those Hollywood studios attracted the best investors and professionals from all around the globe. This explains why in 1915 Hollywood was the setting for the first super production in history, the birth of a nation, a cost around a hundred thousand dollars at that time.

Speaker 2:          09:55          That's miscellanea. By the way, this movie, it was extremely controversial because essentially it portrayed the KKK as the good guys, but I mean, that's an entire story for a different day. The truth is that in less than 10 years, the population of Hollywood grew to more than 30,000 inhabitants. Most of them, they were immigrants like Francisco alias this span. He came to Hollywood to work as a production assistant. Soon he realized he could translate the titles of movies into Spanish this way, the good export them to Spain and Latin America, other immigrants with other mother tongues did the same, and all of a sudden Hollywood movies could be understood everywhere.

Speaker 4:          10:34          Oh,

Speaker 2:          10:38          but hold on just a second because I can guess what you're thinking. Well, what happens to the movies when they have sounds? Well, actually this was a crucial turning points in the history of American movies. I blog now flows. Let's have a quick look as an example. During the times of Nazi Germany, the government, they're invested a fortune in subsidizing German studios, and of course those companies trying to export their films to other countries like Spain. Spain mounted the dictatorship of Francisco Franco was a close ally of the Third Reich. Nonetheless, almost no Spanish movie theaters projected a German movie. That's why was this? Well, the reason is not as idealistic as you might hope. It was a pure technological reason. German studios sent their movies in the German language and they didn't have good systems

Speaker 4:          11:24          out of my shell.

Speaker 2:          11:26          Hollywood studios instead had state of the art methods for Darby plus. Since they have such a high immigrant population, it was easier for them to find translators and voice actors. Some countries even had their own offices in Spain, so they sent the cellular Lloyd ready to be replaced with the Spanish audio track.

Speaker 5:          11:42          There you go. Yeah. They don't know about [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          11:56          In other words, American movies were cheaper to projections and those from any other country.

Speaker 3:          12:00          How did this, the peerless talent of those movie geniuses like John Ford who came from Ireland and Ernst Lubitsch who came from Germany, those were the ultimate weapons that drove America to surpass any other countries. Movie Industry.

Speaker 6:          12:15          I sit at you liberty. You pick it up.

Speaker 2:          12:20          Sorry. Oh yes. Hollywood was born. Thanks to those who came from outside America and Hollywood grew up thanks to selling their movies to the people outside.

Speaker 3:          12:28          If America at her, everybody, I'm just country kill crazy.

Speaker 2:          12:32          And Tina, it's really important that I make it aside in case you've never heard about John Ford, do yourself a favor and watch the man who shot liberty valance. It's the wonderful film and despite the black and white, it hasn't aged.

Speaker 6:          12:45          Show's over.

Speaker 2:          12:47          And now the question might be, what happens after all of this? How did Hollywood survive the censorship and piracy that came later?
