Speaker 1:          00:00          More than 250 million people live in a country other than the one they were born in. In other words, they're immigrants and if you at this number, it doesn't stop growing in the last 50 years. It just multiplied by three and only since the year 2000 is the number of immigrants has increased by 80 million. That's 18 million more people who've left their country in search of a better life. We are the dreamers of USA and as you can imagine, most of the world's immigrants, more than 65% of settles in the richest countries such as the United States, Germany, Australia, and Canada.

Speaker 2:          00:51          I do

Speaker 1:          00:51          this precisely at this fact that is feeding all over the world controversial, furious, and bitter debates on immigration and the discourse of many populist movement in recent years in Europe for example, we've seen a lot of populist and Zena phobic parties and merging, which have targeted immigration directly. You've certainly heard it all. What if they steal our jobs, put us in danger, destroy on national identity, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. That's perhaps the most outstanding case of all of this is Donald Trump. He's made it very clear, but he is a president who really doesn't like immigration except you know, under really certain circumstances,

Speaker 3:          01:37          trump balked at an immigration deal that would include protections for people from Haiti and some nations in Africa. Demand to know why he should accept immigrants from quote whole countries rather than from places like

Speaker 1:          01:50          Norway. Why on earth would trump think that Norwegians once it emigrate on master the United States when they are already rich Americans? In fact, more people are moving from the u s to Norway and the other way around. But let us not straight too far from today's topic because what we're really looking at today is whether immigration is actually a danger. Is it a burden on society? We want to look at whether the United States is losing economic and momentum because of all the immigrants that are coming into the country. We want to look at whether the US should stop the arrival of more foreigners. So that's, that's in,

Speaker 2:          02:30          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Now, if there is one thing that we can all agree on, it's that we live in an increasingly interconnected world that is a world where it's becoming easier, faster and cheaper to go from one place to another.

Speaker 2:          02:50          And there's also

Speaker 1:          02:50          a world where it's easier to connect with our loved ones where they are. And as you can imagine, all of these things make the decision to pack up and move to another country much, much easier. That's why if there were 90 million immigrants around the world in the sixties today, there are more than 250 million. And you know what? We can only expect this number to grow strongly in the upcoming years first. It's because it's becoming easier to move into seconds because of the huge demographic growth that many poor countries are experiencing. So Devi, you are, the real question that we want to get back to is, is there a reason to worry? Well, listen up.

Speaker 2:          03:39          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:44          a lucky break.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Whenever

Speaker 1:          03:48          rich countries talk about immigration, it sounds like that debating whether or not to engage in some sort of charity and then you know what's, nothing could actually be further from the truth. Hair, immigration favors economic growth among other things because most immigrants are adults of working age four. It's been calculated that since the year 2000 immigrants who have been responsible for 40 to 80% of their main recipients, country's workforce growth. So let's be honest, without them, these countries, that'd be far less wealthy.

Speaker 2:          04:22          Bye.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Yes, I know this is all very abstract. If you want to see exactly how this happens in one of the countries where immigration has caused a lot of controversy. Well, let's have a look at the United Kingdom recent years, while some political groups warns about the enormous threats that immigration and including immigrants coming from other European countries posed for British jobs, identity and his way of life. The truth is that the economy has placed very, very different numbers on the team. Never before in history of so many people being employed in the United Kingdom as there are today, neither in absolute or relative terms

Speaker 2:          05:08          I did, and it

Speaker 1:          05:11          doesn't even matter if we exclude immigrants. Yeah. Never before as the British population had as many job opportunities as they do right now, and not only that, it's according to studies from several British universities, all these immigrants pay more taxes than they get in benefits from the state. And if that weren't enough, the UK is managing to attract more university immigrants than any other European country. In other words, the effect of this immigration is very, very positive for the British, and it's also helping turn the United Kingdom into a technological powerhouse. Not Bad. Right. Well, you know what, despite trump's fiery speeches, but the truth is there's, on the other side of the ponds, things aren't really any, listen to this.

Speaker 4:          05:58          I remember

Speaker 1:          06:07          the North American dream

Speaker 4:          06:10          okay.

Speaker 1:          06:11          With just over 44 million people, which is more or less the population of Spain. The United States is in absolute terms. The country with the most immigrants in the world. However, wait just a moment because in relative terms, things are rather difference. These 44 million people represents just under 14% of the entire population. To give you a better idea here, in countries like Australia or New Zealand for example, the percentage is almost twice as high.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Now here is a big question for you and please don't cheat in Google. That's what impact do you think immigration has had on the United States? Well, dear viewer listener, despite representing just under 14% of the population, immigrants are responsible for almost 25% of all businesses that have you been in the United States. They're also responsible for more than 30% of the companies in which venture capital funds invest as almost half of all silicon valley high tech startups are started by immigrants and that's normal here. According to a study from the Center for American entrepreneurship, 43% of the 500 largest companies in the United States were founded either by immigrants or the children of immigrants.

Speaker 2:          07:36          Three weeks ago we bought another toward the new low price custom line. Victoria,

Speaker 1:          07:45          that's 216 companies whose revenues surpass it. $5 trillion every year and employee almost 13 million people all around the world.

Speaker 2:          07:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:58          We're talking about nearly half of the great us economic powerhouse from Henry, forced to Elon Musk and many of the great figures and iconic characters over the United States. They weren't even born in that country.

Speaker 2:          08:16          No.

Speaker 1:          08:18          Well, just a, because I bet something you are probably thinking right now. Well, okay Simon, but those are only a few immigrants, the most educated ones. What about all of the rest, Simon?

Speaker 2:          08:29          Okay,

Speaker 1:          08:29          well the truth is the numbers, they don't very much here either. That entrepreneurship and employment rates, they're also really high and by the way, they also provide several other benefits. For example, in a country that at the moment has pretty much full employment. New immigrants reinforce the U S is competitiveness, encourage the rest of the American population to do more as an alpha. Many businesses that would have otherwise not existed to be creative.

Speaker 1:          08:56          In summary, integralist reduce the populations average age. They have more children or more educated and is more enterprising. They far more patterns as well. The list goes on, and if you think about it for a second, it does make a lot of sense on the one am's. These people arrived, you achieve a better future. So they're willing to take risks and work really hard. No. On the other hands, they've had different experiences and it's education and they can take advantage of this in order to progress thing. For example, if Italian pizzas aren't Mexican tacos that flood for us today as well as the rest of the wells. Well, despite these arguments and the facts that never before have so many Americans had jobs as politicians like Donald Trump still don't like immigration. But you know what? This isn't the first time that the u s political leaders have spoken out against immigration. It has become the issue and the governor's right. Pete Wilson, a one 87 supporter, is pinning his reelection hopes on Eddie immigrants.

Speaker 2:          09:56          The precedents.

Speaker 1:          10:01          This is by no means that the United States, the country of immigrants, has had political campaigns against them. You see in the middle of the 19th century, the political movement, no and nothing opposed immigration, particularly from the Irish and soon after if they focused on the Chinese. Yep. You heard that, right? They, we're focusing on the Chinese. During the second half of the 19th century, many of Chinese came to the United States and that triggered a rather hostile, popular reaction.

Speaker 3:          10:29          Seattle to Los Angeles from Wyoming to the small towns of California. Immigrants from China were forced out of business, run out of town, beaten, tortured, lynched, and massacred usually with little hope of help from the law. Immigration work from the library of Congress,

Speaker 1:          10:46          all this because at that time Americans saw the Chinese as the competition ends in 1982 the federal congress itself a preview to the law of exclusion of the Chinese, which not only suspended the arrival of new Chinese immigrants, but also it made the lives of those who were already in the u s Rafa complicated and bottles and home. In 1924 after around 30 million people who have crossed the Atlantic Ocean to reach the u s Washington established a quote, a policy that greatly reduced the number of immigrants that could arrive and they also vetoed immigrants from southern Europe such as Spain and Italy as well as Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa. So basically the few who it ends or they have to be Anglo saxons.

Speaker 2:          11:30          Hello, more

Speaker 1:          11:31          recently in 1994 the then governor of California, Pete Wilson, blamed Hispanic immigrants for the state's poor economic situation. And do you want to know what he did? Well, he launched a huge political campaign against immigration and pushed the so called a proposition one eight seven a law that prevented access to social, educational and even health services for all illegal immigrants. And yes, this included children. It was so aggressive that just a year later the supreme court declared it unconstitutional.

Speaker 5:          12:00          We are going to think back California working tax paying families of this state.

Speaker 1:          12:09          Well. The fact is that despite all these campaigns against immigration, existing research shows that states and counties that historically had more immigration now have a higher income, less poverty, less unemployment and better educational results does that with all this data in mind, it might be good for both the White House and the capitol. It's a focus less on how to deport people, funds more on how to use strength and access and Tracy to prove once and for all, hey, migrator reform that facilitates the orderly arrival of more people, more workers, more entrepreneurs and more researches. All of this would great and the age, the North American economy, by the way, in a future video, which we'll try to make available very soon for our patrion page and later here on this channel, we're going to discuss the great myths that exist about immigration, but now, well it's your turn.
