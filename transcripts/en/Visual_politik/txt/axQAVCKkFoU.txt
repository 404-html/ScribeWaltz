Speaker 1:          00:00          A political threat looms over much of the world develops countries as well as many emerging countries such as in China's case, I beginning to see the effects that demographic aging and it's can any public services unsustainability can cause with increasing concern along with pensions. Health is another of the fields that generate the most uncertainties and fears. Increasingly aging population and the emergence of new and expensive medical technologies have raised some very important questions. What would we be able to pay for a quality healthcare system or when we'd be condemned to a precarious health situation that affects our life prospects? Is there a successful model that can lead the way other alternatives? Well, in this video we're going to look at a system that we may more or less like that which we should definitely know about us can take into account throughout this debate. It's not sort of look at it, check out the following graph. It shows the country leaving the third world's behind and becoming one of the richest areas on the planet.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:22          35 years ago, Singapore in Spain at the same per capita income today. However, the format more than doubles the Spanish per capita income in 2015 in Singapore is per capita income was $86,100 per year and spends was just $34,750 but even if we look at countries like Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, or the United States as examples, we'd be able to see that Singapore is much richer than any of them. However, it's often said that Singapore's example isn't good enough because their wealth essentially comes from a financial sector that is much larger than any of the aforementioned mentions countries, and that's true, but it's not the only key to this small states success. The weight of Singapore's financial sector isn't big enough to explain these differences in par capita income. In fact, if we were to eliminate the effects of these countries, different financial sector sizes, Singapore would still be much richer than the others because it's actually both trade and manufacturing are more important in Singapore than the financial sector. We're talking about one of the largest merchandise exporting countries in the entire world. For example, the proportion of electronic material that this country exports in relation to its GDP is larger than the proportion of anything exported by countries like Spain, Sweden, Denmark, or even Germany. So the question now becomes, how did Singapore achieved such a high level of prosperity?

Speaker 1:          02:55          Well, if we wanted to simplify it, we could say that Singapore is the freest economy in the wells according to the index of economic freedom published annually by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal. It's public spending, for example, is half of the u acids and a third of Sweden's listen to the words of the historic president's of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, which successfully reflect to the real foundations of this country's economic success. When most of the third world was deeply suspicious of exploitation by Western multinational corporations, Singapore invited them in, they helped us grow, brought in technology and knowhow and raised productivity levels faster than any alternative strategy could of Lee Kuan Yew. Think about what success is, therefore, not due to the financial industry, but due to the same reasons that have led to the growth of other economies. Legal security, low taxes, monetary stability and moderate regulations.

Speaker 2:          03:51          Yes

Speaker 1:          03:54          to the free market has made this country become in many areas. An example, and we're not only talking strictly about economics here, but also certain social issues such as health. When you have that ride, Singapore is also a role model in terms of health policy.

Speaker 3:          04:14          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:19          awesome. Will Challenge.

Speaker 3:          04:21          Sure.

Speaker 1:          04:23          Let's take a look for example, at Spain's case, a country whose health system is considered one of the most efficient on the planet. Well, the problem is that beyond is me incorrigible that isn't sustainable. See, in just a decade, the total cost of the Spanish health system has almost doubles and everything indicates that as a result of the aging population and the demand for new and expensive health technologies, this trends will be unstoppable and will continue to worsen year after year. And don't think that this only happens in Spain, not at all. In fact, medical bills, that is the sustainability of health systems is a widespread problem in other developed countries. So the question that arises is how can we overcome these challenges and ensure the sustainability of healthcare system

Speaker 3:          05:08          good

Speaker 1:          05:08          model, which has never taken into account because perhaps speed that have a complete the free health system, a system in which demand and supply on determines by the market and not in political offices. This could lead to some benefits for one more money for families. Thanks Steph. And lower taxes and a precaution re saving level against any ailments that may arise that's higher than the present one. This would allow for direct primary care payments and insurance against minor ailments, common issues, and more expensive treatment.

Speaker 3:          05:41          Another

Speaker 1:          05:41          benefit would be a greater diversity of its competition among different health centers. This would mean they'd given the threat of being displaced in the market, it's productivity, differentiation and innovation would be promoted, and other words, we'd achieved a wide range of services that would positively impact both for quality of the service and lead to lower prices.

Speaker 2:          06:05          Cool.

Speaker 1:          06:05          Susan is usually the best formula is in guarantee better goods and services for consumers. Since health gap, it's not any different.

Speaker 2:          06:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:13          How is it nowadays? New Country Muses. All of these principles and to know the US health care system, as we'll see, isn't precisely a free market model. Now, there is a country that has used some of these characteristics since it has done so with extraordinary results. So let's consider Singapore's case model for health reform. Why now? Singapore has the best healthcare system in the world. It's top quality and costs. Practically half of that of Spain's healthcare system and less than a third of that of the United States isn't just a matter of lower cost is also above all about quality and results. See, life expectancy at birth in Singapore is two to three years longer than in Britain or the United States. It's infant mortality rate is among the lowest in the world and just almost half that of the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, or France. Generally it's mortality rates are impressive compared to most western countries. Now, the question we can ask ourselves here is how did they achieve such success? Well, in this case, they have achieved at fundamentally by using market criteria. First of all, the main feature of the Singapore model doesn't just lie in the fact that more than 60% of all health spending is private space. To a large extent, it is paid directly by users. That is, copayments is the norm. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:48          Everyone pays the same. When they go to a hospital, there are public and private centers as well as five levels, five classes a, b, one b two Plus B, two and c. Each of these letters gives users a different service. For example, class a gets you a private room and it's my choice of doctor while in class. See the dream is shattered and the doctor is assigned by the hospital. Of course, each class has a different cost. If the user chooses Class A, they pay for everything. Instead, if they choose class, see the government subsidizes 80% of the cost,

Speaker 1:          08:19          but where do people get the money to pay for health care? Well, from the same place as in other countries from the wealth that they generate from their work. The difference is that the huge contributions that government is usually collect that saved in Singapore in a mandatory way. Yes, citizens have a special accounts where they keep this money. They can only use these accounts for certain purposes such as paying that pensions, their children's education for their home or their health. In the case of healthcare, the account is known as medisafe and does he use to pay for doctors visits, hospitalizations, medications, et Cetera. This is the second key points of Singapore's medical system thanks to this formula of demand is self regulating and people can manage how to spend the money they accumulate in these accounts. For example, by accessing different kinds of cow whether they want to receive or be hospitalized in hospitals with fewer comforts but which are cheaper or with more services and higher costs decreasing redundant and sip after was concerned.

Speaker 2:          09:13          Hello?

Speaker 1:          09:14          Very important point is that for most serious cases there's universal public insurance which is known as a shield that it costs only $16 a month for a 30 year old person and with its of course comes the possibility of hiring other private insurer. Is that improve the services? Only. The third leg of Singapore's health system is public expenditure itself. What happens if someone cannot cover their medical bills? Well, to guarantee access to healthcare, the government subsidizes hospitals. Sound has a public funds. The Metro funds, which is designed to pay health bills for lower income family.

Speaker 2:          09:52          Sorry

Speaker 1:          09:53          folks, this is how it, Singapore has managed to create a relatively economical medical system while achieving results and quality levels that placed it among the best health systems in the world according to the World Health Organization and different rankings such as Bloomberg's most efficient healthcare systems. However, despite all of this, when we usually talk about healthcare in the free market, we automatically think of the United States since not Singapore, which is a serious mistake.

Speaker 4:          10:21          Are you listening?

Speaker 2:          10:27          Oh,

Speaker 1:          10:30          USA versus Singapore?

Speaker 2:          10:32          Oh

Speaker 1:          10:34          yes, indeed. The U s does not have a European style public health system and since the country results are quite deplorable, considering that it spends more than 17% of its GDP on its healthcare system, which is quite that of most European countries, the debate on health, it seems settled to private health care is worse than public health care because it costs twice as much and has similar or even lower service levels. But this, as we saw with Singapore where 60% of health spending is private simply isn't true in Singapore. The health care system isn't any better. It's one of the best in the world and it involves much lower costs than in other developed countries.

Speaker 2:          11:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:11          The issue is that the US healthcare system isn't only heavily intervenes upon it and is regulated by the government. It's cost is tremendously socialized. See, 90% of all health spending is channeled through two different agents other than the patients how's of every hundred dollars spent in the US health system? 45 comes from insurance companies, 45 from state programs such as Medicaid and only 10% from patients' pockets.

Speaker 1:          11:44          Yup. Public health spending in the United States is in relative terms higher, for example, than in Spain. But we're going to talk about that in another video. The fact is, as we've seen, Singapore sets a healthcare system model on the table that has a great combination of cost, innovation, and medical results. We may like some aspects of the system and not others, but I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to take it into accounts when talking about health for future and sustainability.
