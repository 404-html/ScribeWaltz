Speaker 1:          00:09          In teenagers, either historical, median cartel data, Pablo Escobar has an idea, basically he had a vision, suddenly have a dream, and that was to turn Columbia into a narco state, the country where the governments and all public institutions would be directly controlled by drug trafficking. Such was his commitment. That's in 1982 as I think you probably know, Pablo Escobar himself, one of the most important mobsters in all of history, gained a seat at the Columbian Chamber of Representatives and it's important to bear in mind that it's one thing for the mafia to buy or bribe a politician and quite another for them to hold all the power directly. Can you imagine a country where the police, the army, all administrative officials, and even the courts themselves as well, timidly under the direct orders of drug dealers. Of course, if Pablo Escobar's vision had panned out, Columbia wouldn't certainly have much higher levels of drug production and exports, but the median cartel itself would become untouchable.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Invincible. He would've gained complete impunity to do and undo whatever he wanted at. Well, fortunately Pablo Escobar never managed to carry out his dream. However, today, three decades later, it looks like his dream is now being realized, but this time we're not talking about Columbia. We're talking about Venezuela, Columbia dictum, wounded, seeing grapples, Columbiana, Archean minutes with dealer. Yeah, Cmo that apparently the four characters you're looking at right now, don't only control the country, they are also the leaders of an international crime and drug trafficking network. Of course, we're talking about Nicolas Maduro, the president of Venezuela, dios data Qbo, the powerful presidents of the National Constituent Assembly who already rank as the strongest man in the regime, and Tarek, El Assami format, vice presidents and current Minister of Industry and national production whose personal fortune according to dea calculations, surpasses the $3,000,000,000 mark. And the fourth is Nestor Rivera, Minister of internal affairs, justice and peace. Who could top it all off. Was the previous national accounts, an architect's office director. Well, everything indicates that these four people are leading the transformation of Venezuela into a narco state. Listen Up. Mafia takes control. Venezuela is in shreds. Hunger is increasing, inflation is out of control, and hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing the country. Even hospitals don't have basic supplies like medicine, analytical equipment, or pastors. There's such a huge mess that the vsa itself, the Venezuelan state owned oil company with the most reserves in the world is bankrupt.

Speaker 2:          02:56          Consider

Speaker 1:          02:57          this to this day, Pdvsa has many embargoed waters. There's in order to sell the increasingly dwindling Venezuelan oil, it's beginning to resort to do tricks and techniques used by Hollywood movie style smugglers. For example, since Venezuelan oil companies are at risk of being confiscated to settle all outstanding debts on the oil, they transport pdvsa has begun to transfer oil from its ships, do other ships with the Cuban flag out at sea. These ships are then responsible for taking the crude oil to its destination, thus avoiding being seized because folks in Venezuela, practically everything that has value has been or is being looted. Corruption has reached almost every corner of the country, so the Bolivarian Revolution promised prosperity. What they forgot to clarify is that all that prosperity would only be for a few for the friends of the revolution. Of course. Don't believe me? Well, take a look at this.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Many regime members promote and lead operations for gas contraband to southern Brazil and Colombia. They are also mostly responsible for food and medicine contrabands, which the state buys and then sells on the black market. They have looted public accounts and tens of billions of dollars have disappeared from the government and from the PDVSA in Venezuela. Even the central banks, US dollars have been looted. Yeah, you really did hear that, right? That allow me to explain this. One of the first things that the Chavez regime did was implement a rigid exchange control. They fixed, for example, the official exchange between the boulevard and the US dollar to a rate that had nothing to do with the numbers on the street. That way the government's friends could access US dollars with just a handful of Bolivares bolivares. That gives it the country's current hyper inflation knob. Now with practically nothing, the minivan was so well perfected that it is estimated that 20 percent of all imports declared in recent years have been completely false operations that were done for the sole purpose of obtaining dollars at the official exchange rate and then to save them in foreign accounts.

Speaker 1:          04:54          And this is important because according to estimates, we could be talking about a theft of more than a hundred billion dollars and of course be Dvsa, hasn't escaped this plunder. A group of companies lent seven point 2 billion boulevard to PD vsa, which when exchange at the black market rate would be about $42, million dollars, but when exchange at the official rate would become approximately $600, million dollars which were deposited in an account in Malta, CSR but t's Venezuelan journalists, but of course sins, no more can be squeezed out of the country. The regime Johnson sought a new alternative source of income.

Speaker 3:          05:33          Put up your faith, put up your faith. I said, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 4:          05:59          Well, they look

Speaker 1:          06:09          it for you.

Speaker 2:          06:10          So no,

Speaker 1:          06:18          turning into a narco state

Speaker 1:          06:22          of drug dealers in Venezuela isn't new med. Has however evolved and I want to explain for years, Colombian cartels trying to use routes through Venezuela to distribute that product. Then of course to do so, they began bing, policemen, national guard members, high officials, et Cetera. These people would then turn a blind eye. This was the first stage as it works. Dealer's got to know the land batter and figured out who they could trust and who they couldn't, so they moved into the second stage of things, which was something like, all right, now that we have a deal, I'll give you some more money, but you don't only look away. You've also got to protect me and transport my merchandise. And this second stage was implemented later. Many Colombian mobsters realized that given the enormous pressure that they had from the Colombian government and the dea, that'd be safer in Venezuela. So at the beginning of the 21st century, that's precisely what happens. Any of these sinister merchants moved their operation centers from Columbia to Venezuela and that's when they started to closely collaborate with the authorities there. And I mean really

Speaker 2:          07:25          sleep

Speaker 1:          07:28          say, what do you think the Venezuelan government did them? Well, and then 2005, they decided to expel the dea from Venezuela and territory and suspends their agreements to monitor knockout flights. Therefore, Venezuelan and territory became a kind of refuge for drug trafficking in the United States. Could no longer keep track of them. They're pretty fantastic for them, isn't it? Of course, in exchange for getting rid of the United States, they have to pay a modest commission. The regime johns, they needed to live off something. Right? Well, that was the third stage. Hold on. One moment, hit because that's how we got to the fourth and last stage, which is where we're at, right? This was going well so well. In fact. So there's plenty of the Bolivarian Revolution. Really. Leaders asked themselves a question. We have the government, the police, the army, and did a lot of resources. Why on earth should we share anything with the Colombians sold? Whoever else?

Speaker 2:          08:17          Let's those couples that are

Speaker 1:          08:22          Columbiana. Archean minutes. Wait, sorry. Do you know what happened then? Well, the Venezuelan authorities began arresting all of the drug traffickers, so you didn't want to cooperate with them by giving that route says well as their distribution business to them. That's how people such as Maximiliano Bonnier, AK, if an NCR know the chief of the office, Heck Taught Harnaman, we Terago Aka Martin Yan Os Diego Perez, Aka Diego restaurant, and Daniel baret rubber re run naked. All Loco fell. All of them were found in the list of most significant traffic, so everything

Speaker 5:          08:56          indicates that right now in Venezuela, even though there are tons of criminal groups operating in the area, the government giants hold the ultimate control and control to characters like del Dotto, Kobe allegedly the most important leader of the cartel, the cartel formed by the leaders of the Bolivarian government's. The Venezuelan people suffer under corrupt politicians who tighten their grip overpower while lining their own pockets. We are imposing costs on figures like Dios, Datto Cabello, who exploited their official positions to engage in narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and Basil Mint of state funds and other corrupt activities. US Treasury Secretary Steven mentioned

Speaker 1:          09:35          in fact one of his own personal assistance, at least me Salazar, fled Venezuela in 2014 with the help of the dea and his statement couldn't be more forceful in addition to providing evidence on the organization's operation. He stated the mystic Dubay presidents of the National Constituent Assembly gives direct orders on the rips and the departure of boats loaded with prohibited substances, and he's not the only one. Testimonies are accumulating in the officers of the DEA, for example. Those will lead Mac lead statements from when he was arrested in Columbia in 2011. Mccullough was one of the most powerful drug traffickers in Venezuela, for example, you controlled Puerto Cabezas, which according to the dea was the exit point for most of the narcotics distributed from the country. Well, after his arrest, he had declared with great detail that he had done business with several dozens of Venezuelan generals, high level government officials such as Henry Rangel Silva, who was later named minister of Defense, or Hugo Carvajal, former army intelligence director who supposedly paid him $50,000 a week, which is certainly a nice salary. He also claims to a financed one of Hugo Chavez campaigns in exchange for concessions in Puerto Conveyor.

Speaker 1:          10:44          With all these relationships, it's easy to understand how in November 2016, a friend and tune your Campo Flores and Francisco Flores to freight us to have the Venezuelan first ladies, nephews were convicted in a New York court conspiring to traffic hundreds of kilos of narcotics and folks, according to current estimates, the business in Venezuela at wingstop growing between 15 and 20 percent of all the cocaine that moves in the world every year passes through this country. And not only that, as apparently the number of laboratories is also raising a great deal. Of course, the giants of the Bolivarian Revolution. The money to keep the structures of repression loyal, the army, the police, the national guard or so in exchange for working in Venezuela, the different criminal groups based there from the mafia to the paramilitaries and the Colombian gorillas support the regime and since there's good business, Maduro and company are still filling that pockets. Unfortunately, the consequences of all of this are terrible for one looting. All public resources has led the country to ruin ends. On top of that, it's fueling an enormous amount of violence. See, according to data from the Venezuelan violence observatory, 2017, there were 89 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in the country that is more than 26,000 people who lost their lives violently.

Speaker 2:          12:06          The

Speaker 1:          12:09          twitter has become the most dangerous country in all of Latin America. And the situation in some areas like Caracas is even worse. The country's homicide rate skyrocketed in 2017 to 130 people 100,000 inhabitants. Meanwhile, members of the government, I'll taking advantage of the situation and developing fortunes which they're using to buy properties all over the world from the Dominican Republic to Madrid. Indeed Madrid is a city to which not only thousands of Venezuelans fleeing the disaster are arriving, but also many of the relatives of the Solos, cartel, bosses and other high position members, loyal to the revolution. Going to now sometimes find myself sitting in restaurants in Madrid right next to people who might. I wouldn't feel comfortable, ever seen CADAC Leopoldo Lopez Gill, father of Leopoldo Lopez, a leading opposition politician who has been kept under house arrest in Cadac us. Unfortunately, the bolivarian regime has founded it's best ally in drug dealing though to fill their pockets and to keep that power in shorter viewer.
