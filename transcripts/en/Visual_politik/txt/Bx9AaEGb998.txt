Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          00:08          the Islamic Republic of Iran. It's that country that makes these independent movies you claim to enjoy bits of never actually watched. This country is also well known in a rather different regard as being one of the United States isn't main enemies as well as being something of an antagonist in Europe and in the democratic world in general, Iran is an Islamic theocracy where the head of state is not even a politician, but a religious leader. The Ayatollah Jones, the legal system is based on sharia law and torture and to executions are pretty common in the country. Oh, and just in case that wasn't enough, the government's also fun. Several terrorist groups all over the world. Important bleed. This one called, hold on just a second because I mean the same is true of Saudi Arabia. Nonetheless, the Saudis, I'll run a major ally of the United States and to have important commercial relationships with the rest of the world. So why is it wrong and seen as bad? Well, Saudi Arabia is seen as good by some western governments. Many would believe that the answer is a pretty simple one. Then that would be oil, but the truth is that Iran has the fourth biggest oil reserves in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:18          Well,

Speaker 2:          01:21          the, their crude oil is similar to that in Saudi Arabia. However, just one year ago they had a band, meaning that they couldn't sell it to most of the world's countries. Yep. You heard that writes for years, both America and Europe didn't want to buy anything that came from this country, so now you might be wondering why is it wrong assumption threat to international security while other countries as radical Islam or being better Teresa's today. We're going to answer that question, but first let's take a look at the history.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Great

Speaker 2:          01:58          thirst is lamach revolution until the 1970s it Roland was one of the most glamorous dictatorships in the wells, the so called sharp from Persia or friends Mohammad Reza Pahlavi rules over the country with an iron fist. At the same time he and his wife are on diva would go sit the magazine stars and yes, I said our friend there because the shah of Persia was a great ally for the United States as well as the free world.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Generally,

Speaker 2:          02:27          as we said a moment ago, Iran holds the fourth largest oil reserves in the world. Plus they have over 80 million inhabitants, Sandy, highly educated population when compared to the neighboring countries. Further there, ron is a crucial spot for controlling the Middle East region. Nonetheless, while the Shah was traveling all across the world in drawing a lifestyle that would make Kanye West look humble, his country was getting ready for a revolution and a surname. I ones out. What sorts of revolution like this be? Was it a communist revolution or perhaps it was an Islamic one? Well, initially the Uranian opposition was pretty varied. Unlike Saudi Arabia, they're wrong, or as it was known before, the Persian empire had a long history as well as a sophisticated

Speaker 1:          03:11          hold on.

Speaker 2:          03:14          So among these opposition groups, you could find pre western liberals, Marxists, Social Democrats, and of course, radical isn't. It assists the latter. Just handle one indifference and bad to the others. They had a leader, the Ayatollah Khomeini displaying living in exile in Paris. He had great charisma and a reputation among via radio, poop is in Paris. Kamini addressed all of these things ellucian raise in Iran, encouraging them to take power with them, promise of a new and democratic Iran and Iran were Marxists liberals and isn't it as could all live together, and this is how the Islamic Revolution

Speaker 1:          03:52          was born.

Speaker 2:          03:58          November of 1979 revolutionary forces took over the government palace and the u s embassy in Tehran. This is actually the basis of the movie argo starring Ben Affleck. In this movie, you can see the story of the American workers at the embassy being taken hostage by the Iranians. Right afterwards, the Ayatollah Khomeini would come back to his country, supported by all of his believers, and this is what he said during his first speech.

Speaker 2:          04:24          There is no need for an Islamic democracy. It is enough with Islam. It was of course, to eliminate the other revolutionary groups that it helps them take a power. All of those western liberals, those Marxists, those social democrats and even moderate Muslims were excluded from the new Islamic republic as of course, the country's relationship with the United States was totally broken. Well, actually it was only kinds of broken in a way. We could say there's America and Z. Iran when from being friends to being gets complicated. Now, on one hand committee hated the u s but on the other hand was Ronald Reagan. The American presidents at the time was selling weapons to the Iranians so they could fight against them. Neighboring country rock. Remember Saddam Hussein? Well, he was a common enemy for those Khomeini, Dan Duncan,

Speaker 1:          05:10          Sandy,

Speaker 2:          05:16          1997 the uranians chose a new presidents Mohammed cut harming, who tried to restore friendly relationships with the US, but at the same time, the supreme leader who was not Khomeini anymore, but this other one you see on the screen, the Ayatollah Khomeini, who had an evergreen obsession with Israel. So he was funding a terrorist organization called [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:38          Cool.

Speaker 2:          05:41          Now, don't forget that any Rhombi ultimate decision maker, this is not the president's, but this religious leader who holds the position of head of state. The says the American President, Bill Clinton said he would never the friend, a country that doesn't want Israel to exist. Meanwhile, the Ron remained. They divided despite the majority of their population being okay with a radically Islamic leadership. There is still a big secular movement in the state. Then in 2005 something happens that would change the fate of Iran. That forever.

Speaker 1:          06:13          Huh?

Speaker 2:          06:13          With Act Martinia judge, despite what it looks like between the ends of the 1990s and the start of the new millennium, Iran had flirted with moderation. Even secularism, they even passed a divorce or that included separation of goods between husband and wife. Not only that, but by the year 2006 50% of the country students were female. Of course, Iran was still a systemic and be violating human rights. Women were forced to have their heads covered and religious minorities wet the bidding. But don't forget, we are talking about an Islamic republic in neighboring Saudi Arabia when ons even allowed to drive. But as you can imagine, this little corner of freedom had not so many fans on the radical Islamic side of the SPEC.

Speaker 1:          06:51          Sure.

Speaker 2:          06:54          So the Ayatollah Khomeini used all his power to radicalize the public opinion against the president, yet they meet. And this is how in 2005 this other guy with an impossible to pronounce, name won the elections would act. Martinia judge is how a radical accounts or reform process started in Iran tortures. Then detentions increased significantly after this year, at least chase down women who wouldn't wear the head job properly and the whole world was shocked by quotes like this one.

Speaker 3:          07:24          Bye Daddy. You don't want to have the of Hanjin spas. We don't have homosexuals like country.

Speaker 2:          07:32          The the ultimate concern for Washington, it was the Uranian attempt to do build their own nuclear bomb. It's pretty scary to imagine the possibilities when a government that publicly declared their intention to raise Israel from the map and to use president denies the Holocaust, has a new BUBBA, Iran hates Saudi Arabia and other relationships that would be complicated by Iran having the bomb. We're actually going to talk more about the Iran Saudi Arabia relationship in an upcoming video, so be sure to subscribe to this channel. Now, if you don't want to miss that, and this is the moment when American has Iran changed their relationship status. Once again, this time that went from it's complicated to,

Speaker 1:          08:15          okay,

Speaker 2:          08:15          dirty council and poses sanctions on Iran for failure to holt uranium enrichment, the Islamic republic became a real danger to international stability. These sanctions were no small thing either. Number, how Iran has the four for larger, it's crude oil reserves in the wells. Well, the economy of Iran unsurprisingly does rely on these exports. So imagine what would happen when the wealthiest countries in the world just stopped buying as since January or Ramian. Government figures show the prices of bread, milk, and meat have risen around 20% well, the price of chicken has jumped about 80% since January. Iranian government figures show the prices of bread and milk and meats have risen around 20% while the price of chicken has jumped about 80% but do wait for just a second because Oh yes, the best is yet to come. The economic crisis destroyed our [inaudible] Janse reputation and his successor and current President Hassan Rouhani came to power under the promise of liberal reforms and better relationships with the West. But this is where things started to get very interesting.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:23          The Arab spring, Iran is a Shia Islamic country. Inside the Muslim world, Shia Islam is a minority. This is one of the reasons why the Iranian ayatollah is have such a bad relationship with the Sunni clergy in Saudi. Right

Speaker 1:          09:35          radio

Speaker 2:          09:41          is the reason why Iran is willing to do whatever they can to fight dash, also known as Islamic states. Bosch is a Sunni Muslim terrorist organization. Add to this. The fact is that once America removed did strips from Iraq, the Ifo, Liz funded the new government in Baghdad and we can explain the following serious President Bashar Al Assad says, the Liberation of Aleppo from terrorists is not only a victory for the mask is, but also adults who participated in the fight against terror, especially Ron and wash up. The Iranian army is fighting Islamic states, both in Syria and in Iraq. And this is both a help as well as a threat to the United States. No one wants to find one radical group just for it to be replaced with a more radical one. And yes, this explains why Obama has an interest in building ties with them

Speaker 1:          10:23          wrong.

Speaker 2:          10:25          It was a pretty small but your fam because he hit two targets with one shot. Now on the one hand is if I'm always sending a signal to Saudi Arabia, he was not willing to help and fight dash on that hand, he is saying whoever defeats the bad guys will have a good relationship with the u s moreover, he would finally see it, an agreement with Iran in order to stop their nuclear program. And this is how they close the famously controversial Iranian nuclear deal under the nuclear deal that we are allies and partners reached with Iran last year. Uh, Ron will not get a tans on a nuclear bomb. The region, the United States and the world will be more secure nonetheless, Obama success that Donald Trump wants to stop this diplomatic process, even though the courts have vetoed his infamous Islam ban. The fact that he included Iran on the list of countries that cannot get into America. There's a clear signal. He is slamming the door on Iran. More importantly, he's showing some love for Saudi Arabia, but this is something we've covered in another video. And if you want to understand why Donald Trump is such a good friend of the Saudis, click on this

Speaker 1:          11:30          video.

Speaker 2:          11:34          Now, here is the big question. Cam America restore their relationship with Iran. Is it worth it in order to encourage around? Yep. More moderate and less radical.
