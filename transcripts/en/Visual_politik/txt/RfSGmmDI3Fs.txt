Speaker 1:          00:00          Funny. It's [inaudible] has become the biggest threat to the euro zone. Why is this? Well, that's what we're going to tell you in this video.

Speaker 2:          00:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:15          the cradle of the West, the place of pastor pizza and pop. You like coffee making techniques like the Cappuccino, ristretto and espresso. It's all in SLA, but in addition to this, it's really, it has become quite a headache for Europe's leaders. No ones are, I mean, we're talking about a giant of the could turn into a true titanic.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:37          We're talking about an economic and financial crisis that could make greases crisis look like child's play. See, it's only currently has the eighth largest economy in the world, but this country isn't growing. It's banking system has loads of problems and it is. Governments is hugely in debt. In fact, this is at least public debt already surpasses 130% of its GDP, which means that even though it has the fourth largest economy in the European Union off to Germany, the United Kingdom and France, it also has the largest public debt stock. This amounts to more than two point $5 trillion. The Italian public debt folks is twice the size of the entire Mexican economy. I'd almost four times the size of the Swiss economy and that's if you didn't figure out is a lot of it.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Money

Speaker 1:          01:26          Prolo doesn't even begin to end that the Italian economy is hardly growing. In fact, it hasn't managed to get back to its pre 2008 crisis levels. Unemployment, it's a pass is 10% and youth unemployment lies at around 40%

Speaker 1:          01:43          total of this. We need to add the fact that year after year, public debt continues to rise and it won't stop growing. The country has a very big population with an agent problem and above all, the European Central Bank, which in recent years has been Italy's largest public debt purchaser could soon stop doing that. European Central Bank says it's massive bond buying program will likely end in December. All of that said, we can easily understand news like this. Italy is pushing Europe to the brink of another economic crisis. The Italian crisis that is making the EU tremble worsens. All right. Is there something you might not be wondering? Well, yes, Simon, I get it, but this is hardly new. It's at, he's been a problem for ages. Why we spotlighting it now? Well, I'm going to tell you government a step back after months of uncertainty, a new government finally gained power in June of 2018 and we're not talking about just any governor

Speaker 2:          02:45          that's

Speaker 1:          02:47          led by the new prime minister just sat by [inaudible]. We're talking about a government formed by the euro skeptic and antisystem movement, fivestars ends by La Liga and extremely far right wing party. This new coalition arrived with a very clear idea in mind. It's at least sovereignty would again be in room and not in Brussels, which in most cases wouldn't mean anything except a higher expense.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Well, the fact is that as you know, the countries that belonged to the euro zone, that is those that share the same currency agree on certain goals with the European authorities as well as on some maximum public deficit levels and on a path of these deficits have to follow over the years. All of this is done to maintain their stability and solvency and thus reduce the risk of crisis. Well, the new Italian government does not like this one yet. Deficit path, I mean, come on now. You're not going to tell me how to spend my money. Europe, and this is more or less what the new government must have fought because one of the first things they did was present a budget proposal in September for a public deficits that is substantially larger than the one they committed to in Brussels. And that is when the earthquake happens, it'll eat, defies the European Union and increases their deficits.

Speaker 1:          03:59          2.4% of GDP and you have government wanting to spend money that they, and he's got a public debt problem and now they want to ask for a higher dance. Well I'm seeing is believing because folks 2.4% might sound low, but if we take the facts that the Italian economy is forecasted to not grow more than 1% in the upcoming years into accounts, then things really do change because that 2.4% now means that with every year that passes, Italy will become less solvent. That is, it will be even less able to pay off its debts. So do you know what came of this dialogue between the new euro skeptic governments in Brussels? Well, since just on says new governments orientation was exposed, the 10 year Italian bonds profitability sorted by more than 90% that is investors now understand that there's a very high risk and therefore they require a higher profitability if they're going to lend them money. Obviously this means that every time the Italian government issues debt, it has to include higher interest. Cleans that up to the year 2020 it's only we'll have to face debt maturities of almost $600 billion and a balance. Of course it'll have to request again from the markets along with the deficits that it has accumulated. Until then, this amounts to more than $700 billion, which is an insane number.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Well, it hit investors ask for more profitability. Interests will be higher and so will the public deficits and if in addition, the European central bank stops buying debt, it could mean even higher interest rates to the point that this spiral cup at the Italian government's on the ropes and then its banks as fault, they own a good part of it are these dat also. It doesn't really seem likely that they will be able to withstand a new recession. Italy's banks stumble into a new crisis and of course that's not all Italy is Greece. It's huge size cause me the spread of that financial crisis throughout the entire euro zone. That's why the new Italian government's policies have led to so much concern. Italy is a time on the could simply explode at any moment. That's why it doesn't seem likely that the European Central, we'll stop funding the party. The only reason Italy isn't already rated junk is because the readings agencies assume the ECB will step in to prevent a default. In that sense, Italian bonds are actually German bonds. John Rubino. The question now is, well, how long can the situation last, but now that we know what's happening, the question that remains is how did we get to this point? Well, listen,

Speaker 1:          06:26          origin of the problem,

Speaker 2:          06:29          awesome.

Speaker 1:          06:30          Long ago we dedicated to video to you how Italy arrived at the situation. We can basically summarize it as a lack of competitiveness. Yes, Italian politicians really didn't care about the economy while for well changed at full speed. Italy punished companies with extremely high taxes and lots of regulations and that's what all the states kept hiring more and more officials and spending money without really caring about the results. For example, any one in five young Italians gets a university degree or race. That's almost half of the ovc d average as of course, if you aren't educating your youth and forget about being competitive, well, what else can you expect? If that weren't enough by adopting the euro, Italian politicians can no longer use one of their favorite tricks, devaluing the currency. So this folks, this is what explains the dark news that we occasionally see in the media.

Speaker 1:          07:16          As you can probably see the situation, it's all rather complicated. And here are visual politic. We're going to try and keep up with all the events.
