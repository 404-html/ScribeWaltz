Speaker 1:          00:08          Have you ever heard of bill? Just online threats from Baghdad? It seems probable that geography students will seem to have to learn the name of this capital city as well as its new country, and that would be a rocky Carter stock the 25th of December this year. What's the historical moments for the more than 5 million Kurds who currently live in this autonomous community in the north of Iraq? Well, why was this? Well, that's because of after decades of unfulfilled promises and ethnic repression, they have the opportunity to vote in a referendum organized by the regional governments of Kurdistan since 2005 and according to the constitution of Iran, Kurdistan is an autonomous region. Despite it being an autonomous region, though this place essentially works as it's own almost independent country, and the result of this was that the population really wanted to be fully independent.

Speaker 1:          01:00          The day of the referendum, Kurds showed up on mass to the polling stations. Even the speakers of mosques encouraged voters to go to the polls. Well, the final results showed the referendum was a complete success. More than seven out of every 10 Kurds went to vote. That's almost 3.1 million voters. The victory. Well, it was overwhelming for those who supported independence, the movements it's obtained. 92.73% of the vote, and you know what's what? This triumph. That's totally understandable because we're talking about some of the most ill treated people in history. They will treat it despite the fact that the Kurds are recording to many experts, the most ancient people in this entire region. It is estimated that their culture, their language, their rituals, essentially everything that could define them have been in this part of the world's upper Mesopotamia for more than 4,000 years. In fact, many of these experts consider the city center of Erbil, the capital as the oldest human settlement to be continuously inhabited on the planet.

Speaker 1:          02:06          In other words, the Kurds Zam bolder than the Persians, or indeed the Arabs. However, they have suffered from all kinds of persecution. See, the total number of kids is it rounds at 30 million spread across mainly for countries, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Iraq. Well in all of these places, the Kurds have suffered the consequences of nationalism, which is trying to make them disappear as a community. They've tried to do ends their culture, their language, as well as trying to close down their media outlets. Between 1986 and 1989 Saddam Hussein launched the amf full campaign and estimation saw the between 50,002 180,000 Kurds died. As a result, as you might imagine, this cannot easily be forgotten. My grandfather had a good sense of humor. He used to say that he was born, occurred in a free country. Then the Ottomans arrived and said to my grandfather, your Ottoman, at the fall of the Ottoman empire, he became Turkish.

Speaker 1:          02:57          The church left and he became a gert. Then the British arrived, so my grandfather became a subject of his Gracious Majesty. The British invented Iraq, so my grandfather became Iraqi, but to his dying breath, he was never proud of being Iraqi in air or saline. My father's rifle, a childhood in Kurdistan. Considering the history, it's no surprise that the Kurds once, once and for all to make the dream of having their own state come true. And if we add up the facts, there's Iraqi had a stone is quite a rich area in terms of oil and natural gas as well as fresh water. By the way, we can understand even more why they want independence. So just some of, cause they wanted that right and country and say they held a referendum in order to do that.

Speaker 2:          03:38          The referendum,

Speaker 1:          03:43          as we have said, Kurdistan is almost an independent country already. They even have their own army of more than 200,000 soldiers. This army is called the Peshmerga and they've, by the way, he'd been the main defense to Islamic state in Iraq. Do bear this in mind because the governments of Kurdistan is a close ally of Washington. Indeed, it may be their most loyal ally in the region because of this, the u s has trained, financed and well armed their army. So I'm indeed even save that the Kurds are as pro American is the taxes.

Speaker 1:          04:16          So after many difficult years of intense fighting against Islamic state, it has been clear for the Kurds. There are almost no advantages in remaining in Iraq and the governments have a bill took advantage of these battles in order to integrate curd areas into that political space. For example, there is the province of Coco who has a majority of Kurds but was not within the autonomous region of Kurdistan. Go Cook is something of a crown jewel. And one of the main reasons for the conflict with the Iraqi government, by the way, as not hesitate to just send their troops over to recover the settlements. Iraqi forces sweep into Kirkuk checking Kurdish independence drive. So why is this territory so valuable? Well, that's because curt cook is the province that contains the most Eileen Curtis start. In fact, it's been estimated that around 10% of all Iraqi oil reserves are concentrated here in car cooked and nobody wants to let

Speaker 2:          05:02          good

Speaker 1:          05:06          in 2007 a referendum. It should have been conducted in order to incorporate or not the autonomous region of Kurdistan. The voting in never took place. So when the peshmerga occupying the city in order to protect it from Islamic state, since the Iraqi army had literally run away, the curd governments had facto annexed the territory. So with these conditions and with the constant negotiations between Baghdad and beale men's with a growing disconnect between both territories, they eventually got the referendum. This is the first time in history that the people of Kurdistan will freely decide their future. After that, we will start talks with Baghdad to reach an agreement over borders, water and oil. Mister Barzani, president of Iraqi Kurdistan, now the governments of Iraq at post this referendum in every way as a constitutional court of Iraq, even our Lord is parliaments asked for many things, including the withdrawal of representation in our bill. Lee bought a clothes and even army deployments in Kirkuk. There was also the prosecution of organizers of the referendum, and it's, of course, parliament tried their best to remain in control of all of the oil. But even with this kind of action by the Iraqi government to the Kurds, they didn't really care.

Speaker 2:          06:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:18          That's the only logical because despite the progress of the Iraqi army, the risk for Kurdistan is probably not in Iraq, but rather with the international community, you see Turkey and Iran, they don't even want to hear about an independent Kurdistan. That's because it might give the Kurds in their territory is the idea that they can replicate this success. So lucky for instance, there's been at war with the Kurds for decades, but that's a story for another day. The thing is that these countries have allied with Iraq in order to defy the referendum. Turkey's military has confirmed that Turkey and Iraq will conduct a joint military drills in Turkey along an area bordering Iraq, semi autonomous Kurdish region. Iran's semiofficial, I s n a news agency reported on Sunday that the Supreme National Security Council, a closed Iranian airspace to the Iraqi Kurdish area at the request of the central government in Baghdad and there's no way, it's not just about the possibility of conflicts after all, this is likely to be the result of fear tactics, which are very usual in this kind of situation and they rarely work.

Speaker 1:          07:18          By the way. Remember Kurdistan is a close ally of the USA and they haven't experienced and well trained army? No. The bigger issue here might be that Kurdistan they need then neighbors this territory it's landlocked and as they are very dependent on Turkey both in order to export their oil, Dan to import anything that they might meet, so a trade blockade, it would be a serious threat for this territory. The KRG is economy depends on one pipeline that sells oil to international markets and that pipeline goes through Turkey. You shut down that pipeline, you choke the Kurdish economy. Bilal Wahab analysts at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Bounce there is more to it than just their neighbors. Nobody wants any more tension with this part of the world. Internationally speaking, the referendum didn't get much support. The U S as opposed to it and Antonio Guitars, secretary general of the UN has described it as dangerous and potentially disruptive and today Israel is the only country that supports independence. So this might mean the future is not looking very good. Right. Well wait just a second because it's, despite all of this, it is very likely the Kurdistan will achieve independence, you know, or later.

Speaker 1:          08:31          The reasons for a new country, Iraqi Kurdistan, it's got many issues. However, they have managed to become the region that functions the best in Iraq. They are the safest and wealthiest area. I've been to Iraqi, Kurdistan and number of times it's safer than Kansas if you're coming from Baghdad or muscle. It's practically Switzerland. Michael J totten American journalists. Check this out. In 2014 before the irs offensive, this region was turning into the most relevant financial and tourist spot in Iraq and oasis. Many businessmen, both local and foreign skyscrapers, moles and mentions where it's spreading like mushrooms after the rain. That was until Walbro broke out in Iraq against the Islamic state. Then most of this development, it's empty. You have to stop now, often an awful few years of walk in 2017 the numbers at bouncing back. And do you remember that this area is oil rich? Some estimations calculate the oil reserves of Kurdistan at 45 billion barrels, but this into words, Kurdistan would be among the 15 oil richest countries on earth, and this isn't a country with this or more than 5 million inhabitants, but there's still so much more it rugs.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Kurdistan is quite business friendly. Indeed. They like private initiatives. Something uncommon in this part of the globe. The taxes are also attractive and bureaucracy is not excessive either. Unfortunately though there is still plenty of corruption. The Kurdistan government will do its best to help the private sector and have them invest here. I invite all local and foreign investors here to take advantage of our laws and offers and invest Masoud Barzani, president of Iraqi Kurdistan. The thing is that this region has enough going for it to make a Kurdistan, a prosperous country. Their first, our lambs, high levels of safety and natural resources, whether they're geographical location is beneficial. It's a place between Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. But on top of all of that, this new country, it's only, well there because people then, especially Iraqi Kurds had been deported attacks with chemical weapons and have suffered all sorts of social engineering in order to strangle their culture.

Speaker 1:          10:29          And now they have an opportunity to build their own country for the rest of us. Could also benefits from a more moderate, prosperous and to free country than the ones around it in the Middle East would certainly be better for us. So now we've got to consider the problems in Iraqi Kurdistan. I mean, first of all, oh, they're ready. Well, yes, absolutely. But that's no excuse to not make this new country happen first because these problems exist now with them still being a part of Iraq and seconds because they are less serious than the ones in the rest of the country. So what about corruption? Yes, it's totally there. And is there oil dependency also? Yes. And what about debt? Well, yes, there is that too. But this is totally normal in this part of the wells because the rest of Iraq is in a much worse situation.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Well anyway, we just wished that bag Dan's a response does not turn the situation into a military conflicts. That would be a terrible scenario for everyone. Indeed, it would be a situation where political interests prevail above the interests of the people, but now it's time for your opinion. Do you support the idea of the independence of Kurdistan?
