Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          many of you have written to us asking for a video about what's going on in Turkey and believe me, the situation there is quite dangerous. And in case you were wondering, Nope, this time Donald Trump is not to blame for this. In fact, the u s sanctions are just the tip of the iceberg here. And this is an iceberg that could wreck many ships. And so when we say ships we really mean European banks. Just look at the map we're showing.

Speaker 1:          00:28          Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Tuckey is a bridge between Europe and Asia. We're talking about a country with a population as big as Germany, a country where Europe has been investing for decades, companies, factories, and of course there are lots and lots of loans. One an example. Well, hey you are, have you ever heard of bb? Va is the second biggest bank in Spain? Well, Turkey is the third biggest market for this bank. In other words, when the Turks Sneeze and lots of Europeans end up with a Kohl's, I'm scared enough yet. Well listen up. Turkey isn't important. NATO member for America. They have the biggest army in the alliance and they are one of the few countries with a Muslim majority and secular constitution, at least for now. Yep. You heard that rice we said so far, but the truth is that the Turkish president, while he has not a big fan of secularism or when there's something like the antiquing Skywalker of politics, he started out as the good guy in the movie boss. We all know that eventually it will fall to the dark side.

Speaker 2:          01:43          In this case, the dock side is a mix between a religious fanaticism. Well, good old populism. I don't want likes to portray himself as the defender of the average man. Those tax that live in rural areas like Kanya. I completely outside of the Glamor of his stumble, the tax that they don't have amazing salaries and they maintain a traditional lifestyle as well. Who Do these people need to be protected against? Well, of course that would be the western conspiracy that wants to end Turkey. This explains why it, because this is so important for to one's narrow

Speaker 2:          02:17          us impose sanctions and Turkish officials over the paint American pastor. Nonetheless, this is just the tip of the iceberg. First of all, the actual reason behind the US sanctions is not the pastor that's the military and sanctions with the Kurds in Syria, but that's another story for another video. The truth is Turkey's crisis has been going on for three years already and this isn't just a political crisis. In fact, the biggest problem is economics. We're talking about a small scale of Venezuela here, right at the very gates of Europe. But now the question is what is going on in Turkey? What happens in this country to cause them to fall to the dark side of economics and do we really have to be scattered today? We're going to answer all of these questions, but before we do, as always, let's take a look back at the huddle.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Strange Erdogan,

Speaker 2:          03:11          the savior, so he is famous for Mary thinks, seems Sophia Kebab sins inflation. Since 1970 and until the year 2000 Turkey had sky high inflation rates, many years, they even surpass the 100% mark. This means that from one year to the next, prices would double. And what happens when you have so much inflation and you live so close to wealthy European countries? Well, you become a cheap labor. Disneyland's companies like Renault of Persia builds lots of factories in Turkey. But hold on a second because I can guess when you're probably thinking right now, you're probably thinking about, okay Simon, but isn't this actually good news for a country? Well, yes and no. At the same time. For example, in the 1960s Renno opens a factory in Bursar, a city in northern Turkey, manufacturing cars in Bursar. It was very cheap for rent. I, since the Turkish lira was devaluing year after year, Renno had to pay the lower and lower salaries.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Okay?

Speaker 2:          04:22          Nonetheless, when they got the money from selling those cars of the era, rarely think they kept it inside Turkey of course, and see they've Turkish money. It was losing value so fast. The smartest thing you could do with your money was take it out of the country as well, fast as you possibly could. This is why Turkey seemed doomed to stagnation. That was until the year 2003 that's the, uh, [inaudible] came to power. His main goal was to keep inflation below 10%. It created a new car and see the Turkish lira. This was a currency far more stable than the previous,

Speaker 2:          05:05          and as soon as inflation was enhance, the Turkish economy is made a 180 degree shift. All of a sudden, many European companies started investing in Turkey. This included banks. One of them, the Spanish bbb we mentioned previously invested in this country, big time. In fact, so much so that now Turkey is the third largest market. So in the two thousands Turkey, it was in fashion rule of law ans monetary stability. Men, the company has good reinvest in the country. So if less than 10 years, your average Turkish work, it went from making 800 US dollars a month to making more than $1,200

Speaker 1:          05:40          it's a month. Mother knew

Speaker 2:          05:48          that in those first oto in years and new industries like tourism develops, Turkey went from 13 million tourists to 39 million. And what Turkish companies? Well, have you ever heard of Turkish Airlines in the nineties Turkish Airlines was just another carrier, but since they can now reinvest that profit, they ended up becoming an aviation juggernauts. Now, believe me, this is not an isolated case. If there's one great example of the Turkish men are old and it has to be yelled as holdings. This company, it started out as a family owned bakery and now they've already bought European brands like godiva chocolates or united biscuits. Today, yielders holdings is the world's third biggest company in the entire food sector. So in other words, the Turkish economy, it was absolutely on fire. Zia Company who was on the line that would really seem to care that one had been to prison for being a part of a radical group. At the end of the day, the country was still democratic. Another one was the Arab rock star. He was the chosen one. He was the one who was going to bring the Islamic wells. That's the bright side. Bags in Turkey wanted to be European. They were just about to the Karma member of the European Union as a fun fact in 2003 they even won the eurovision song contest

Speaker 2:          07:09          last, as you might know, the negotiations to become a part of the EU extended over a really long time. So what happens? Well, over one lost his patients and he essentially said, oh, what? So I'm not cool enough to join your club. Well, you know what? I'm tired of being western. I'm tired of a separation of powers. I'm tired of secularism. All of that. It's now over. Now is the time. In the last five years, things started to sour. Third one first, he was personally involved in many corruption cases, but worst of all was news like this

Speaker 3:          07:49          Istanbul, Ataturk airport attack, 41 dead and more than 230 hurt

Speaker 2:          07:55          Dasha tax of brought Islamic terrorism and insecurity to the streets of Turkey and the damage to the tourism industry. It was a media in just two years. Tourism income has fallen by 25% and this is especially worrying given the tourism accounts for 13% of the Turkish economy. But that's not all foreign investment has fallen by half. And I, you might be wondering, well why? Well there are two reasons for this. The first one is the lack of a chance that Turkey is going to become a part of the European Union. And the second one while I was out of one himself. Yes [inaudible] Islamic radicalism is not just a danger politics wise. It is also a danger for economics.

Speaker 1:          08:36          Ah,

Speaker 3:          08:37          he's earned a one calls, interest rates the mother of all evil. The lira slides

Speaker 2:          08:44          according to Ottawa, the so called Economic Orthodoxy is a Western invention that will destabilize Turkey borrowing money with interesting. It goes against Islam. So he runs to the central bank and forced them to lower the interest rates and start printing money. And what if the central bank and when he refused and he said, I just, I just don't want to do that. Well these are, I don't want as well

Speaker 1:          09:07          central. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:07          Thank can't take this independence and set aside the signals given by the president or to one speaking to Bloomberg. So in other words, after the failed coup to tar of 2016 oh one has finally fallen into the dark side, he thinks he can manage the economy at his will and to every rational critic against his economic policy is seen as a western conspiracy that he even named his son in law as the finance minister. This new economic paradigm is not a free markets or social democracy. This is the new, I don't want to nominate.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Do you mean

Speaker 2:          09:50          money to pay? You feel spending wild, you simply princess, I'll Turkish companies complaining flood the market with chief credit. In less than two years, Turkish banks have given more than $50 billion worth of loans and all of this is with almost no interest. The results, well that's a crazy devaluation of the Turkish lira 2014 the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Turkish lira was about 2.5 Liros to the dollar at the time of the making of this video. However, the exchange rate, is it more than six lyrice to the dollar? This means that the Turkish lira has lost two thirds of its value compared to four years ago. It's also partially accounts for why inflation rates have risen so high to 11.9% in the end of 27

Speaker 1:          10:32          t

Speaker 2:          10:36          all right. All right. I don't want you to thinking I live in boy. 9% doesn't sound so bad. I mean in Argentina they have three times that inflation is the truth is that you need some time between a devaluation and the rise in day to day prices. So who were the first ones suffering the effects of this deflation? Well, those would be the companies that had loans in foreign bank and there are more than a few of them. You really yielders holdings the food industry bm off. Well, here you go. Check this out. Turkish owner of Godiva chocolate to restructure, six point $5 billion worth of debt estimation. Say that foreign debt from salvage companies to surpass is $300 billion for a lesser understanding. This is the same amount of money spent in all of the bailouts of Greece and meanwhile the inflation rate is starting to grow little by little this year, 2018 it's already reached 15% since all the nongovernmental estimation saying that at the beginning of 2019 it's going to rise to 22%

Speaker 1:          11:33          yes,

Speaker 2:          11:36          Turkey's software and credit rating cut deeper into junk as s and p seized recession next year. Add to this, the sanctions imposed by Donald Trump. We're going to talk about the reasons behind the sanctions in another video, but here we want to focus on the economics because in the middle of all of this, there is another player with a lot the loose and that's the European. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:54          union.

Speaker 2:          12:00          Thanks like the Spanish Ppva and the fringe and BNP of paradise or the Italian unicredit. As I've learned more than $190 billion to Turkish companies so far, BBV has already lost half of the value of those investments, so you can already imagine the big gap that a Turkish collapse would leave so far out. Again has said that he won't ask for a bailouts from the International Monetary Fund and he will not raise capital controls either. But Kenny really stick to his words. We just don't know here. All we know is that both Qatar and China have already promised to help for Turkish economy, but it is still too soon to tell what's going to happen. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:38          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:41          So now the question really goes to you. Do you think Turkey will become the European Venezuela? Could this localized crisis creates a bigger crisis all across Europe? Could add one pull. Everybody is the dark side.

Speaker 1:          12:56          Ah,
