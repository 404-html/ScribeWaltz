Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          They were visual politic when not exactly massive fans of Donald Trump. As viewers of our Spanish language channel, we'll note particularly however, there is one area where we must admit the Donald Trump is absolutely correct. If you want to be a citizen of Mexico, you and let's assume you're a perfect person, okay? You want to be, you could not become a citizen of Mexico. It's the hardest place just about in the country, in the world to become a citizen. In this case, Donald Trump is telling the truth. Mexico has an immigration policy that is way more restrictive than the American one. To understand this Pesa in 2015 the Mexican government is kicked out of its country. 100,000 foreign is one. It's the neighbor to the north kicks out of 300 thousands okay, so actually on the face of things, it looks as if the u s deports more people than Mexico. Rice, I mean 300,000 versus 100,000 but you really must think about this in relative terms, but one Mexico's population is three times smaller than the United States and it's also a far less attractive destination for immigrant.

Speaker 1:          01:16          That's it.

Speaker 2:          01:17          We can say that the Mexican authorities deport nearly everyone who crosses into the country through their southern border with the leaves and Guatemala is that is the deport all of the people who decide to stay in Mexico rather than heading further north to the United States. In fact, while America has an immigrant population of 14% which is by the way average in terms of developed countries, Mexico has an immigrant population on just one.

Speaker 1:          01:45          In fact,

Speaker 2:          01:46          well the Mexican presidents on Recap Pinion, yet always saying this to Donald Trump, we'll make you or Nesta, Mexicans living in us are honest, hardworking people. They are good people. They respect family, they respect their communities and they deserve respect, will make you medicine and respectful. They told us 48% of the Mexican population holds a negative or very negative opinion about immigrants from Central America. In fact, in 2016 a Mexican newspaper called La, Yana published the following,

Speaker 3:          02:27          yes

Speaker 2:          02:27          to the border wall, but in the south of Mexico, the problems between the u s and Mexico can be solved by building a border like the one proposed by Donald Trump, but in the south so we can keep illegal aliens out of Central American. It's so rather interesting. Right, and that's why in today's visual politic video, were you going to be looking in to Mexico's immigration policy?

Speaker 3:          02:52          Why? Why does

Speaker 2:          02:52          Mexico Deport Central American immigrants? The first thing that we need to understand before talking about immigration to is their geographical location. What's imagine that you live in Nicaragua and you want to move to the United States. Let's also say that you have no money to purchase a plane tickets. In this case, the only way for you to get from Nicaragua to the United States is by land, and that means going through Mexico. Currently, the biggest flow of immigrants in the world is from Central America to the United States.

Speaker 2:          03:26          And and 15 alone, over 22 million people made this trip. It's an extremely dangerous journey on roads that are in terrible condition as immigrants also passed through some incredibly violent areas. And don't forget Mexican states like chip pass ski area. When a lower the hotspots for drug trafficking, they suffer all kinds of abuses, extortion, kidnapping, human trafficking, drug trafficking, human and sexual slavery. Right. Do you understand this best when some of the immigrants arrive in the south of Mexico and they have to continue that journey to the US on the reef of a train? This train has become known as the beast or the death train, and it's not hard to figure out why. With Amenia key, this is why some immigrants' decide to stay in Mexico. This situation was the perfect excuse for the Mexican government to pass it, the lady to properly RCR or population law. This was passed in the mid 1970s the law was Paulie put in place in order to restrict the flow of immigrants to the country in order to avoid human trafficking and abuse. So this sounds like a well intentioned law. So what exactly was the problem? Well, what's it first appeared to be something good for foreigners. It quickly became hell for them. And now you might be wondering what exactly made this law quite so bad for immigrants. Well, quite simply, it gave the government the power to expel foreigners or reasons as ludicrous as this one,

Speaker 2:          04:51          the secretary can the knife 40 nurse and trans to the country or change the quality or characteristics of the migration in order to keep at demographic balance and otherwise Mexico only once immigrants from wealthy countries. And if possible, it's better if this skin is white as well. What's the result of all this? Well, it turns out that seven out of every 10 immigrants to Mexico off from the United States. And what about the rest of them? What about that other three wells, they're mostly from Spain. In fact in Mexican has twice as many Spaniards living in it does it? Does Guatemala. Now this wouldn't exactly be a big surprise except for the fact of the Guatemala shares a border with Mexico and Spain is thousands of miles away across in,

Speaker 3:          05:35          Yup.

Speaker 2:          05:39          This is not all Mexico has an equal number of German immigrants as it does Peruvians. So if you come from Europe or the United States, you're going to have no problem getting a visa for Mexico. Lee, your helping to improve that demographic balance. But if you happen to be from Peru, wants to live in the country of Robert Rodriguez, well good luck to the Mexican governments. You on nothing more than a demographic

Speaker 1:          06:04          rats.

Speaker 2:          06:09          Hold on for a second because there's more according to the previous and he mentions law. Being an immigrant in Mexico is a felony. This means that at any moments of federal agents can request your documentation and if you don't have the documentation, you can be forced to leave. Country ends pay a fine of two months average salary in Mexico. Okay. Okay, so now you might be thinking, well, every country gets to determine its own immigration policy, right? Well that's absolutely right and until 2010 no other governments complains about Mexico's immigration policy in 2010 something happens that embarrassed the entire night.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Patient,

Speaker 2:          06:48          governor Jan Brewer on Friday signed the states immigration bill in low. It is considered to be among the toughest legislation in the nation. As ironic as it sounds, that rezone a law which was meant to stop immigrants from Mexico, was a copy of that same Mexican law birds. Actually in practice it was slightly less extreme. For example, while Arizona's government considers it to be a felony to be an illegal immigrants, it doesn't really matter because Arizona State's law doesn't apply to the federal government, so the reality was the federal police could do nothing. Nevertheless, vis law caught the attention of the world's media and the president of bank then Philippe cals around didn't remain silence doll that gets the same brain [inaudible] collection, criminalizes immigration, social phenomenon and economic phenomena. Every load that penalizes it opening up the door for intolerance and discrimination as well. There you have it since then, day diction. Reason next to the word hypocrisy have started including a picture of Philippe Calderon wrong and quickly following this statement came the world's reaction. The Mexican government were forced to change to that population law that we mentioned. This meant that immigration to Mexico wasn't no longer eight felony was do hold on that for just one second because that is not the end of us.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Boring.

Speaker 2:          08:13          Yes, it is true. The Mexico changed its immigration law, but it didn't diesel entirely. Remember when I said to the Mexican federal police can request the documentation of any person at any time. Well, that is still happening today. Today in the United States, the authorities need to suspect you of committing a crime. If they want to ask you the documentation, this means is over and easy for them to stop you on the street and to rescue for being then legal immigrants. Meanwhile, down in Mexico, this is happening every single day adds of this. The limited control over the country have over their own police force and you get stories like this.

Speaker 1:          08:50          Escape

Speaker 2:          08:50          deportation migrants often pay bribes to inm agents of between and $300 and of course the mass deportations of Central American immigrants remain exactly the same. But do you really think that Mexico is the only place where this is happening? Because the answer is absolutely not. Now. Normally when we talk about immigration, we're normally talking about people who are living in a poor country, moving to a rich country.

Speaker 1:          09:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:24          there's, there's in 2015 over 80 million people moved from one poor country to a another poor country. They were just moving to a poor country that is slightly better off than that original country. As an example, every year thousands of people move from Bangladesh to India and the authorities don't exactly welcomed them with open arms. Just consider what Narendra Modi sets the Indian presidents when he was running for office. You can write it down after Mexico [inaudible] these Bangladeshis better be prepared with their backs packed. This is really a big difference when compared to the immigrant friendly policies of countries like Canada or New Zealand, which by the way are some of the wealthiest countries in the world. This is just our opinion here at the visual politic and we would love to know what you think. Do you think that Europe and the United States should follow examples set by countries like Mexico and India, or follow the examples of countries like Canada and New Zealand?
