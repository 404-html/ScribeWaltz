Speaker 1:          00:00          One thing is very clear, Vladimir Putin is one of the most controversial politicians in the world. He is vitalized by some and hated by others, but what is for sure is that Putin's period in office is making its mark on international politics. The truth is that the government has achieved little in terms of economic and social matters under his leadership. His popularity among Russians remains really high today. In this video, we're going to analyze why Putin is quite popular in Russia,

Speaker 1:          00:36          so this, this Spanish saying that says after the storm that comes the calm. Well, when it comes to Russia, this is exactly what happens after going through a tough crisis in the last few years due to the fall in oil prices as well as the sanctions received from the international community for occupying Crimea. The government has been pretty blunt, but difficult times have passed. Ams. The Russian economy is back, but is it really, I mean, where's the evidence to really back this up and tell me, what do you think Russian grief is expected to be in 2017? Twelve percent maybe nine, five, three, two? Nope. Well, it's actually predicted to be one percent

Speaker 2:          01:13          month after month. The Russian economy keeps growing. For 2017, we're expecting a growth of one percent or even more Igor Shuvalov

Speaker 1:          01:21          that sure doesn't look like a lot and that's bearing in mind that Russia is not exactly a rich country to begin with, and to be honest, that one percent is only if we believe the statistics of the Russian government's, which well, more and more analysts considered to be rather fictitious. The truth is that even though everything seems to indicate that the Russian economy is more stable for last few years, have not exactly been easy for the Russians. According to the Russian social security institutes in the year 2016 alone, Russian citizens suffered from the biggest loss in purchasing power. That means real income since the 19 nineties. Not a good

Speaker 2:          01:56          thing. The crisis and the depreciation of the ruble, the Russian currency has led to this country with $145 million inhabitants, tabet GDP that's similar to that of Australia, which only has a population of $23 million.

Speaker 1:          02:09          And what's even worse is that for now it doesn't look like the situation is going to improve. So here we come to the great Russian anomaly evidence, which shows that this country is very different from any other, neither the crisis and all these terrible economic conditions have damaged the national popularity of Vladimir Putin. In fact, Putin's popularity is today higher than it's pretty much ever been. According to polls from the Levada Center, Putin's approval rating among the Russian population is almost 80 percent. I'll have a look at it.

Speaker 3:          02:39          This

Speaker 1:          02:44          now. You might be wondering how is this even possible? Why is this man immune to such a crisis? Well, let's have a look at just what is happening.

Speaker 3:          02:55          The protective father, when the Russian

Speaker 1:          03:00          economy is pretty much mandatory to talk about oil and raw materials, and here are two pieces of information so you can get some idea of just how dependent on Russia is on these resources

Speaker 2:          03:10          before the fall. And the prices of crude oil, oil and natural gas meant a lot to the Russian economy. Seventy percent of the country's exports and more than 50 percent of all income of the Russian government came from these two commodities.

Speaker 1:          03:26          And take a look at the evolution of the price of oil during the years. Peter has been in office. So anyway. Well Putin, he was incredibly lucky right after he reached out the price of oil, which should remained stable around $20 a barrel for the last 10 years, started to increase quickly and of course this is an amazing flow of money coming into the country just so you can get an idea of how significant this was. The share the government contributed to the economy rose from 35 percent to 70 percent. All of a sudden prosperity came to the entire nation. There were cranes everywhere. Skyscrapers started to appear as if they were mushrooms after the rain and the standard of living for Russians went up and up and up. Yeah. So it is true that Putin's authoritarianism could be felt right from the very beginning, but I mean say what you ucas. The money was flowing. Okay, so we could say that there was this sort of agreements between Russian society leader in exchange for not asking you about civil liberties or corruption. The government gave prosperity and stability to the citizens. In a way Putin became some sort of protective father to the nation. A tough, capable father who was able to take care of his children has always. The problem is that these situations are fragile. Know government's not even Putin's as the capacity of achieving this prosperity all on its higher.

Speaker 2:          04:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:49          With such high oil prices, Putin didn't conduct any reforms in Russia. I mean, what would really be the point ends up because of that. When the price of oil starts to go down in the summer of 2014, the economy of Russia followed the same pattern and it is here that we come to the most interesting part of this story. None of these things affected Putin's popularity. The Russian president knew, for want of a better word, how to recycle his earliest strategy. If at the beginning he was the guardian of prosperity, now he would become the leader who would recover the previous great influenced that mother Russia use to have

Speaker 3:          05:26          nationalist

Speaker 1:          05:27          fervor. Sorry if Russia's economy wasn't having the best moments. Well, he had to look for another source of popularity and Putin, well, he knew where to find it. For 500 years. Russia's foreign policy was all about expanding its influenced since the times of only when the terrible around the 14th century, Russia expanded its territory on average 80 square kilometers a day until it became by far the largest country on earth dance well as the most powerful. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the influence of Russia on the world collapse. Puson made a new promise and it could be summarized like this, be a prosperous country and the economic situation may be bad, but I bladimir poutine will recover Russia's influence in the world. You may not be your wealthy people. Bless you. Our nation will be strong in order to make this strategy work. Some things on unnecessary. The first of them is to praise nationalist sentiments, and this means well. Russia, Russia, and more. Russia

Speaker 2:          06:46          bladimir unveiled a statue of medieval namesake who united Russian land.

Speaker 1:          06:52          Well, either way following these same ideals, all the recurring adverts of new invincible weapons, incredibly powerful ones which will guarantee you Russia gains great status and global supremacy. First of all, though, an important question is going to be whether the Russian governments can actually afford these weapons. The second necessary thing is rather more sinister and that's going to be for Russia to find an enemy. This enemy is something that can push Russians towards a common goal. Let me explain that a little further. Russia, they need a threats. They need an aggressive. They need something for the Russians to unite against, and in order to achieve that content requires an aggressive foreign policy.

Speaker 3:          07:32          I see

Speaker 1:          07:34          the Ukrainian crisis, the accusations against NATO and the occupation of Crimea. All examples that have made Putin's popularity rise again in the alleys. If the Russians, Putin is taking Russia back to its previous grants.

Speaker 3:          07:47          Yes,

Speaker 1:          07:51          second strategy, you can explain the busy schedule of rough and diplomacy. In the last few years, they may not have much money that Moscow is everywhere, Ukraine, Syria and North Africa, and hey, to be honest, the sanctions the international community have imposed on Russia had kind of the opposite effect that was intended. They have been seen by the Russians as humiliating and if they've had any effects, he was to consolidate popular support for Vladimir Putin. Seventy five,

Speaker 2:          08:17          four percent of Russians consider the sanctions to be an intention to weaken and humiliate Russia. Only five percent. Think of them as an instrument to stop the conflict in Ukraine, Levada center

Speaker 1:          08:29          and last of all for Putin. It is unnecessary for him to consolidate to the image of a strong determined leader, almost a national hero something of a savior, if you will. There is no Russia today if there is no Putin, sorry. These are the keys and understanding why Vladimir Putin has been able to keep an even increases popularity. He is no longer the guardian of prosperity, but the leader who will regain the power that Russia ones had crony capitalism.

Speaker 1:          09:02          Another decisiveness at Sydney considered is that Putin's governments also survivors because he has been able to create a network of powerful oligarchs around him who have gotten rich thanks to the resources of the Russian state governments aids launch state contracts and things in its commitments to replace imports have all benefited. These oligarchs, former judo partner awarded contract to build Russian bridge to Crimea. It'll cost more than $3,000,000,000 besides speak to it as a backup plan. In case things go awry, he can privatized or more accurately just give states companies away to these oligarchs who will use that power and money to further Putin's interests. The Russian president has made it clear that nobody strategic investors will be allowed to participate in privatizations, and that means only investors who have been selected by the Russian government's iron fist. Oh, Ron's. Lest we forget the repression, political repression and the repression of minorities.

Speaker 1:          10:01          That seems to be kind of a fetish for dictators and potential dictators. I mean, just take a look at the last report from Amnesty International on human rights in Russia. It's pretty sad. Restrictions on right to freedom of expression, association and Peaceful Assembly increased in 2016. Well, now we all know the ingredients that explains Putin's popularity, nationalism, oligarchs, censorship, and political repression. Putin has promised the people that they will become powerful again in exchange for that unconditional loyalty. However, despite all of this posturing, it does seem kind of unlikely that Russia is going to be able to seriously competes with either China or the US in the media and in the long run, but that's our opinion here, visual politic, and as always, we'd love to know what you think. Do you think Putin will be successful in giving Russia rids old power back? What would you prefer? National Power Bowl, maybe wellbeing, prosperity, and freedom. We definitely know what weird ones, but we'd like to know what you would like. Drop us a comment below this video.
