Speaker 1:          00:00          If I asked you what the largest ecommerce company in the world was, I bet most of you would answer Amazon without even hesitating. However, that might not actually be the case. Listen Up,

Speaker 2:          00:21          Ali Baba started 18 years ago. We never change. I'll a drink. We believe e commerce. We believe Internet. We've been lead by helping young people helping small business and helping empower women. We will have the future

Speaker 1:          00:41          his value of more than $400 billion in more than 600 million customers worldwide. Ali Baba is an incredible success story. That's all. Say the most valuable Chinese company in the world. We can say that this company has become the best representative of the new form of Chinese capitalism. Let's go back for a second. Is the question that we asked at the beginning of this video. Is Amazon the largest ECOMMERCE company in the world? Well, that kind of depends. For example, we take a look at the market value. That is how much investors value the company asks. Then undoubtedly Amazon is the largest company, but if instead we focus on the volume of sales made through the company every year, that is where more goods are bought and sold. Then Alibaba wins by a landslide.

Speaker 2:          01:37          Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Salad Baba might not be as popular as well known as Amazon after all. It mostly works in the Asian markets, but although it may seem far away, products worth a total of more than $750 billion I sold each year through Alibaba has different platform.

Speaker 2:          01:55          Nope.

Speaker 1:          01:56          [inaudible] of you who usually follow visual politics surely won't be surprised by what I'm saying. Asia is undergoing a revolution, a take off an unprecedented economic growth process.

Speaker 2:          02:06          Every week,

Speaker 1:          02:07          year around 160 million people leave poverty behinds and managed to become a part of the middle class. 160 million people in Asia alone in the next few years. Countries like the Philippines and Thailand are going to have a middle classes as large as those in the United Kingdom, France, the recipe and then there's China. He's middle class is absolutely exploding. It's taking off almost vertical.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:30          What happens when a person leaves poverty behind and becomes a part of the middle class? Well, among other things, it means they now have much more money just fence. This explains why their trainees retail market is multiplied by four in the last five years and why forecasts indicates that the growth Chinese consumption in the next three to four years will be greater than everything the British or Germans consume today. Do you know who holds both in 70% of the share in China's ecommerce sector and is very well positioned in the other fastest growing Asian countries? Yup. That's Alibaba to partnerships with Alibaba. Canadian producers have been able to sell their innovative technologies, apparel and quality fresh food to almost half a billion Chinese customers. I'm sure by now you're beginning to see this company in a rather different

Speaker 2:          03:22          light.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Oh, we take a look at Alibaba has characteristics. It's lice and its dark sides. Let's see how it all began. Let's have a look at the history. Jack Ma's mirror

Speaker 2:          03:45          coleman.

Speaker 1:          03:47          Never the best student, but thanks to the foreign tourists. He visited his hometown and especially to the relationship he developed with an Australian family, Jack Ma, a child born in a humble family just two years before Mao's cultural revolution managed to learn English and decried. All the advantages offered by the modern world and as is often the case in life. It wasn't formal studies, but the small experiences, the kind we often don't even pay attention to that fat. The success of the person who is today, the richest man in all of China. I'm 100% made in China. I learned English myself. I know nothing about technology. One of the reasons why Alibaba survived is because I know nothing about computers. I'm like a blind man riding on the back of a blind tiger. Jack Ma, Jack Ma, one of the heroes of the new modern China, didn't have the opportunity to attend a good university.

Speaker 1:          04:38          However, since he learned English, he managed to graduate with a teaching degree, got a job as a language teacher and a few years later launched a translation company and it was on a trip to the United States to perform a translation service that some friends from Seattle showed him what was then an incipient technology called the internet. That moments, an idea had jack jacker right in the face. I was afraid of touching the computer because it seemed very expensive, but they said, come on Jack, go ahead. It's not a bomb. Then I typed the word beer, b, e, e r and I could see German and Japanese beer, but not Chinese spear. Then I typed the word China and the answer was no results. Then I thought, how interesting if we could group all the companies in China and create a page for them, maybe that would achieve something big Jack Ma as that's precisely what he did. After returning to China, Jack said, Tata Company, China pages to list, classify, classifying, thus find Chinese companies. Something like the yellow pages. This company didn't have the expected success, but Jack Learns enough to be ready for his next adventure after a lot of work in a small apartment, but if he had a team, had managed to train without virtually any resources created Alibaba in 1999 and it's now one of the largest companies on the planet.

Speaker 1:          05:57          Great. Mark.

Speaker 2:          05:58          Good.

Speaker 1:          06:00          I'm wondering what Alibaba does, we should ask ourselves what doesn't

Speaker 2:          06:06          because

Speaker 1:          06:07          see, Alibaba isn't simply an ecommerce portal, but rather are kind of technological intermediary. In other words, I'm like Amazon. Alibaba doesn't sell anything directly, but basically functions as a large market where thousands and thousands of brands, producers and distribution companies sell their products to millions of customers. That is, Alibaba is the owner company, the company that manages this huge market and supplies. Everything that brands, producers and distributors need to be able to carry out their business from payment platforms to metadata. This may be it's biggest difference from Amazon. For example, think about the huge amount of data that these companies handle. Consumer trends, budgets, types of customers, purchase, timing, et cetera. Well, while Amazon uses all that data to develop his own product lines, Alibaba shares them with the companies that operate through their markets so that they can launch new products or no, their consumers' preferences better runs with us, sell more, making the market grow, which makes Alibaba Greg.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Thus overtime Alibaba has developed a several different markets, so if you'd like to better understand what Alibaba is exactly. Let's take a look at what those markets are and how they differ. First of all, we have alibaba.com the huge wholesale markets, perhaps the largest online wholesale markets on the planet. That is to see this market isn't aimed at consumers through this space. Producers and manufacturers selling their products in Biloxi, other companies so they can distribute them in their countries. For example, say you have a store and you want to order 5,000 red shirts with a specific logo. This is the place that you go to. Unless we use Alibaba. It's extremely difficult, expensive, and frustrating to find a supplier. Alibaba cut out the middle man. They make it extremely easy to find, communicate and negotiate with suppliers directly through their website. J June businessmen and investor. Then in China, in addition to the local wholesale markets, which in this case is known as 1680 eight.com Alibaba has two of the largest retail electronic commerce or markets in the country. Taobao and teamwork.

Speaker 2:          08:09          Cool. See,

Speaker 1:          08:12          Taobao is pretty much a combination between Amazon and Ebay. Yeah. Practically anyone can sell that product. It's a market with thousands and thousands of suppliers and almost 600 million active consumers. Team old on the other hand, is a large online shopping center oriented towards big brands. The brands pay a fee to have their own store, basically like any shopping mall. Then one of the, that's an old crown jewels. Alibaba owns more than 80% of Lazada. The most important ecommerce company in South Asia. This is a company that operates in countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. And watch out because we aren't talking about something small scale only in the next two to three years, these countries will see them middleclass multiplied by two discipline us, 400 million people, 400 million people that Alibaba wants to turn into customers. And finally we have what is probably the best known platform, but most of us, aliexpress and international consumer oriented platform. Well, these folks are Alibaba has mean markets, but the company's activities end that Alibaba is also one of the five most important power computing companies in the world. And of course it's trainers, undisputed leader, and this division is growth rate has surpassed 100% annually in recent yet

Speaker 1:          09:30          companies such as kpmg, Nestle, Phillips, and sap already use hourly cloud services. It also owns Yukui streaming platform, similar to youtube, ele.me, China's largest home delivery company, which among many other companies also holds a significant share of. Why though? Something like the Chinese facebook, but just a second, have any of you heard of Ali pay for those who don't know what it is? Hourly pay is very similar to paypal. It has more than 817 million active users. And there's the leader in the Chinese mobile payment market.

Speaker 2:          10:02          Yes.

Speaker 1:          10:05          See, in China, credit cards aren't common at all. The trainees have jumped directly to mobile payments, so when they go to the supermarket, instead of paying with visa or mastercard, they use Ali pay or we chats payment services. The two main payment systems in the Chinese market, while Alibaba owns 33% of ANZ financial, the company that owns alipay and also pate and the leading mobile payments application in India. And I've a strongly growing markets. To give you an idea of what this means as financials, estimated value surpasses $150 billion. Just a moment, because if this entire online bet wasn't enough, Alibaba is also investing billions in supermarkets and other physical stores where it has its own brand. Hema is also the largest shareholder in the sun art retail group, the largest supermarkets and hypermarkets operator in all of it,

Speaker 2:          10:54          China.

Speaker 1:          10:56          So as you can see, the Alibaba or empire extends its tentacles into a lot of Saturday things up. Alibaba has services equivalent to those of Amazon, Ebay, Justi, visa, youtube, facebook, and even cough or all in the same company. Certainly not bad. Well, this is precisely why this company is worth more than $400 billion on the stock market, but I don't think we can end this story without talking about the future.

Speaker 2:          11:22          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:28          risks and opportunities. If we look at it, Alibaba has plans, very ambitious,

Speaker 2:          11:37          bye.

Speaker 1:          11:38          20 sales made through Alibaba is different platforms will exceed $1 trillion just 18 years. The company aims to surpass 2 billion customers.

Speaker 2:          11:59          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          11:59          Yeah, that's the goal, but will they achieve it? Well, obviously we can't know, but the truth is that it has many cards on the table. See, despite this company's huge growth since its foundation in 1999 it still has great potential. No, do I need, because ecommerce is growing a lot around the welds, but also because everything indicates that growth will be explosive for many years, particularly in this region.

Speaker 1:          12:22          Let's take a look at it. For example, China. Alibaba is a main market here. The Internet has only expanded by 55% so there's still a lot of work to do. We're talking about hundreds of millions of people who will sooner or later connect to the Internet and start making that first online purchases. I'm not only that, given that Chinese purchasing power is growing stronger year after year, the same is happening with the average amount of purchases. See it since 2015 the average Ali Baba customers spending has grown by 50% in China. So if we combine more spending and more clients, well, you can see how enormous the potential is here. And then in addition that rob the countries which belonged to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, also India, we're talking about an area of the world that is not only going to see a huge economic growth, but it's also estimated to grow by more than 700 million people in the next three decades. All of this is of course, in addition to the international market. Now, hold on a second, because everything's not so rosy. Like many Internet companies who focus all their attention on growing and growing, the company isn't actually making much money.

Speaker 1:          13:38          Okay. So we're talking about a $400 billion company that has barely managed to make a net profit of eight point $4 billion in the last 12 months. And that might sound like a lot of money, but the market value is 50 times in that profit. And that's a lot. And of course one may think, well, okay, yeah. Okay, but so what, I mean it's definitely gonna make money in the future. Well, maybe or maybe not, because if the market grows so much, it usually entails a very strong incentives for you competitors, new rivals, something that is already happening in a certain, yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:09          Competitors like J d. Dot. Coleman does specialty pin duo duo are investing a lot of money to compete with Alibaba, even though they aren't very successful, they may never beat Alibaba are off. Maybe they will. The truth is that the massive water, it adds more pressure to the markets, which may reduce the margins in which these companies operate in the future.

Speaker 2:          14:26          John,

Speaker 1:          14:29          of course, there's the Chinese government, which as you know, is not exactly the best guarantor in the world. As you know. The Chinese government doesn't undoes things as it pleases and they can even determine who survives in a market and do doesn't. That means that a botched delivery to a communist party leader could become Alibaba's worst nightmare.

Speaker 2:          14:51          In any

Speaker 1:          14:52          case, it's clear that Alibaba is the best example of the changes that are weld is experiencing how Asia is gaining power and how it's beginning to acquire its own large multinationals ends.
