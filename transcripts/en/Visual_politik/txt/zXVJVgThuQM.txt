Speaker 1:          00:07          Tina is a country famous for three things, tango, soccer and economic crises. Although that latter one might change sooner rather than later. Yes. Dvo once again, we aren't talking about lithium or white gold or the new oil and it's the staff that have batteries are made out of lithium is what powers your smart phone, your laptop and maybe even your electric car. As we said in this other video. Argentina is alongside with Chile and Bolivia, one of the three countries that make up this so called lithium triangle. This is an area where 60 to 80% of the welds discovered lithium reserves are concentrated from these three countries. Argentina is getting the biggest detention like international investors.

Speaker 2:          00:53          Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:54          That writes the biggest hedge funds have their eyes on this country. This is a big surprise given the dodge and Tina used to be the boogie man of finances. The problem childs of economics now, well, it's growing into something of a rockstar. Sorry. Today's question is, well, what happens to this country in which improve their image in assumption, short time? Can they really become the leader over the lithium race is most important of all? Can Lithium turn Argentina into a new Abu Darby today? We all goings on. So all of these questions, but before we get started, let's take a look at the history.

Speaker 3:          01:34          Argentina first.

Speaker 1:          01:35          In the last few years, Argentina had become something of a boogie man, but hedge funds under the presidency of Cristina Fernandez de catch. Now Argentina's governance did it. Whatever they could to scare away any foreign company you might want to invest in the

Speaker 4:          01:47          treat tobacco. Of course it [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:56          when it comes to the mining and oil industry. Kirschner made an interesting move. In 2008 she passed a law against the repatriation of capital. This means that if an Australian mining company made profit by extracting oil and minerals on Argentinian soil, the government wouldn't allow the company to send that money back to Australia. Coach's goal was to force these foreign companies to keep the financial benefits of their mining in the country

Speaker 1:          02:21          math or the last. As you can imagine, the consequence of this law was that most of the foreign companies simply stops doing business in the country. The ends of the day. I mean, why would they, if it was forbidden to enjoy those profits at home? Well, this, it was not enough. The real turning point for Argentina came in the year 2012

Speaker 3:          02:42          Argentina, x rates ypf to rub salt

Speaker 1:          02:44          repsol all of the largest oil company in Spain in the year 1998 and merged with Arjun time company Y F for many years, this brands was simply called at Repsol Ypf. But one day, Cristina Fernandez de Koechner in a very Donald Trump fashion sense, well, Argentina first Hashtag make Argentina grades again. He lets him a key. How does that stay here? Even if their shareholders are foreigners are Argentinian competence. Now you might wonder, well, what happens next? Well, of course the repsol pursued several lawsuits with the governments of Argentina, but this was not the worst thing. The biggest problem was that after being nationalized Argentine YDF, it reduced their oil production.

Speaker 2:          03:28          Oh,

Speaker 1:          03:34          wheel production extends decline as rig activity slows. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking, well, what's the connection between oil production and it's being owned by private companies or being owned by the governments? I mean there are several states, oil companies that work really well. For one example there is Aramco. This is the biggest dinosaur juice producer. I'm still, it is. I'm buying the Saudi government's. The problem here is that both in the oil ams, the mining industry, you need high tech.

Speaker 2:          04:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:05          Each company has different technologies and patents. In other words, when why the f wants it to drill those oil beds of Baca. I'm wet and they needed to utilize a complicated technology called fracking. I am as well only a few companies in the wells that have the machines and the skills to do this kind of work. This is why it is so common. The difference. Oil companies create a joint venture to exploit an oil bat when reps old left Argentina, why p have lost a technology partner and this is why people will say the catch near fought against those Spanish near Liberals and ended up partnering with the American ones.

Speaker 2:          04:41          Sure.

Speaker 1:          04:41          YPF signed one point $5 billion shale oil deal. Hold on just a second because, well, this isn't the end of our story. The biggest issue here is what happens when you take over a company from one day to the other. Well, what happens is the rest of the businesses are going to be afraid of you and good luck trying to convince them to invest in your country. Think about it. Let's imagine you have an oil or a mining company. Would you really dead set up a factory and the loss of facilities in a place where the government can just sees all of that from you. I think not man's this among other factors. This is what explains why Argentina today has such a big crisis, but now Argentina has a president called Maury, Theo Macri man's well, the times they are a changing.

Speaker 5:          05:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:31          Gold rush in Argentina and December, 2015 macri took his place in the pink house. The Pink House is the elgin time version of the White House.

Speaker 2:          05:43          That was the country I'm

Speaker 1:          05:45          tree in the middle of a bankruptcy. Real inflation was higher than 40% dollars were sold on the black market and there was no company willing to invest in the country. And all of this was despite them being one of the wealthiest countries when it comes to natural resources. This is why since the very first moment, Macri has tried to conduct a 180 degree shift compared to what his predessessors yeah.

Speaker 5:          06:07          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          06:10          Argentina's new government scraps, mining taxes.

Speaker 1:          06:12          In other words, Macri knows that lithium is a pls opportunity to repair the accounting books. Of course not. No one expects Argentine. And to become a new Dubai over night that this white gold is a windfall and that money could cover the gaps of Argentina's budget without raising taxes and without cutting costs. And as well, this explains laws like this,

Speaker 5:          06:35          Margie,

Speaker 3:          06:36          Tina signs, mining deal to unified regulations attract investment.

Speaker 1:          06:40          In other words from now on, mining multinationals have an open door to the country and unlike what happens with the coach and the era of these foreign companies can do whatever they want with their profits. This is happening because Macri has removed the anti repatriation law as if this was not enough. Legislation has been put into facts which unifies mining regulations all across the country. This means that the rules are the same no matter where the lithium battery is. Further, the mining companies will not have to pay any special mining tax in. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          07:09          industry heavyweights album Marlay court saw Clinica, he manera de Chile s a era met s a n junk. See Gum fun lithium company are among groups looking at expanding or building new lithium operations

Speaker 5:          07:22          in Argentina.

Speaker 1:          07:26          Pause. Hold on for just a second because well, things they are not quite as great as they seem. Lithium is a great opportunity for Argentina bars. As you know, having natural resources does not mean your country isn't necessarily wealthy. Many entre into Indians fear what they would call a new Potosi. This means is that they fear that their country would become flooded with foreign companies that take the resources and leave without bringing any money in to Argentina. So the question now becomes what can Argentina do to avoid such a catastrophe?

Speaker 6:          07:59          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:05          really

Speaker 3:          08:05          chance of origin.

Speaker 2:          08:06          Tina

Speaker 1:          08:09          said in a previous video, the real business of lithium is not lithium itself, but to the added value products you can manufacture. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          08:16          With us at the time

Speaker 1:          08:22          when we recorded this video, a metric ton of lithium had a market price of $9,000 nevertheless, if we take that raw material and then we turned it into mobile phone batteries, we could get an income of between 1.5 and $5 million. Of course, this is a very rough estimation, but it does help us understand something important. Hold on just a moment because this is still mode as simple as it looks, works

Speaker 3:          08:46          muscle lithium battery factories are in countries like the United States, Germany, or of course China. These three countries have worldclass network of small companies provide services and components to the big manufacturing. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:58          well we're talking to

Speaker 3:          09:00          about logistics, semiconductors and someone. All of these things make the manufacturing process cheaper and more efficient, but not only that, this network effect is what attracts the best engineers in skilled professionals to these countries. This is a central, if you want to create a high tech industry in it

Speaker 2:          09:16          country,

Speaker 1:          09:19          like good luck trying to convince a woman who lives in San Francisco and makes a six figure salary to move to Roserio Argentina to work in a factory. As you can imagine, that's pretty much impossible.

Speaker 1:          09:33          Now you might be wondering, Wash, can matt green due to industrialize his country? Well, the first thing we have to keep in mind is that silicon valley, it was not created in a day. Nevertheless, Argentina has a great advantage over California. They can make easy money by selling raw lithium. Of course there's money can be used by the government to simply boost their earnings, but it is also a good opportunity to invest in universities that will train those workers that might start those small companies that are needed in order to get the big factories up and yeah,

Speaker 2:          10:01          running

Speaker 1:          10:04          the government can also co-financed brand new businesses. This is actually the formula that helps Israel become a technological capital as well. So far it seems that Macri is committed to working this way.

Speaker 3:          10:14          We have learned, we have understand that in addition to our talents, our huge natural resources, we have to add constancy. We have to add rule of law to be predictable.

Speaker 2:          10:35          But

Speaker 3:          10:36          wait a minute because there are some dark clouds on the horizon. All these opportunities, Argentina has will disappear if my cree or whoever follows him falls back into the temptation of destroying the rule of law and going back to ultra nationalism, which could scare away foreigners as it has in many other countries.

Speaker 1:          10:53          And it seems that Cristina Fernandez de catch now wants to run for office again.

Speaker 3:          10:58          I am not asking you to vote for me. [inaudible] I'm not asking you to vote with the people behind me. I am asking you to vote for yourself.

Speaker 2:          11:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Say well now it's your turn. Do you think Argentina could restore the rule of Lauren's to come a wealthy country thanks to lithium or how are we going to see a new nationalist backlash and there's a brand new economic crisis? Well you can leave your answer in the comment section below and just before he goes to there you've got an important request from you.
