Speaker 1:          00:08          It's no secret Israel and the Arab countries have never had a good relationship and they've always had a pretty terrible one. Three wars, dozens of diplomatic conflict, send all kinds of accusations.

Speaker 1:          00:23          The Arab Israeli conflict was one of the hottest in the second half of the 20th century. So when you have problems with your neighbors, well you have a problem, but if your neighbors are the largest oil producers in the world, well then you really have a much bigger problem. This is especially true when you consider that Israel has always been considered something of an energy wasteland. All attempts to find oil there weren't been successful. Now it is true that up until 1979, Israel has a nice Aulani in the region. Can you guess which country this was? Well, you might be surprised to learn that it was Iran. Yep, that's right. In the Times of the shower of Persia, Iran was a close ally of Israel. After all, they both had a common enemy and that was the Arabic countries for the first time. We see them arriving at Parliament House to take over the range of Apis that these countries and such a close relationship that in 1978, Israel offered the shower of punisher help in building nuclear power plants. Yes, really, however, that all changed in 1979 with Khomeini's revolution. From that moment on Israel and Iran went from being good friends too. Well, great enemies.

Speaker 1:          01:31          The thing is that Israel has always had two main weaknesses. The first is this bad relations with countries in the region and the seconds are the difficulties they've had ensuring that oil supply, especially when facing conflict, the minister for energy in Israel admitted in 2014. This real situation is complicated. Don't have diplomatic relations with most of the countries from which we import oil, Yusef Paritski. However, it seems as if all of this, it's about to change gift gift. That is the definition Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, gave to the latest discoveries made in the Mediterranean Sea discoveries which might change forever. These strategic reality of the conflict of region of the Middle East, but now you are probably wondering what might those discoveries beat? Well, pay attention to this map. Each yellow piece represents the newly discovered natural gas

Speaker 2:          02:32          fields

Speaker 1:          02:34          and these are not small fields, either the last of them to be found and known as Leviathan is one of the largest reserves founds in the last few decades.

Speaker 1:          02:46          Israel has done everything they could since 1952 in order to find oil or gas in that territory. Something that they could achieve energy independence, but I'm until the year 2000. All of their attempts, they were unsuccessful. If you were 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and I said Israel would find a big amount of energy and be almost totally independent when it comes to energy, you would think that I am crazy. We were the country of milk and honey, but when it came to oil, we've left it to our neighbors. Not t beren boy Thomas Group. However, everything started to change in the year 2000 thanks to technology. When a tax company, Nobel energy founds the first reserve in the open sea, known as Mari, be this first one, it was small, but it was a turning point because they knew that under the sea, on the sea bed that were surprises waiting, so noble energy kept exploring the bottom of the sea and in 2009 they hit the Jack.

Speaker 1:          03:43          They found it for you tomorrow reserves, so you science was significance. In fact, the reserve provides Israel with half of that electricity requirements last year, later in 2010. Well they did. It just hit the Jackpot. In the casino, they won the lottery after spending only $100, million dollars in the exploration of the area, noble energy hits Leviathan, an enormous field. So now you're probably starting to understand what's going on here, a little best app. It is estimated that this reserve is larger than all of the ones found in countries like Bolivia or Mexico as well. This is not the end of the story because most of this area is still unexplored. In fact, the geological studies have indicated that there is much more natural gas 5,000 meters below the surface. Oh, there is also oil. Moreover, the government estimates that the Mediterranean could be holding a colossal wealth in natural gas and oil as well. This falls within Israeli waters. In total, the government estimates that there might be more than 3 trillion cubic meters of gas and 6 billion barrels of oil. All right, that's all well and good, but what exactly is 3 trillion cubic meters? I mean it's not exactly easy to picture, so you can appreciate the songs of this. If these estimations. All right, Israel, a small country of only around $8 million inhabitants could become one of the top 15 countries when it comes to natural gas reserves and in the top 20 countries when it comes to it

Speaker 2:          05:07          oil.

Speaker 1:          05:16          This is not just for Israel exports. They've already started at the end of 2016 Israeli companies reached an agreement with the government of Jordan to become its main supplier for the next 15 years. It's a contract will have more than $10,000,000,000 between 50 and 60 percent of that money is going straight to the coffers of the Israeli government. That's the right division of politic view, or in the next few decades, the government of Israel is going to get an income in the tens of billions of dollars, tentative estimations, and I confirmed we would be talking about hundreds of billions of dollars and there's more. It looks like Israel lacks continental oil, but there could be in massive quantities of shale oil. The type of oil that can be extracted through fracking well, they've already found the first reserves. This means that not only is Israel going to achieve energy independence, but it could even become a new energy power.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Now you might know why ness and Yahoo, it has referred to these fields as God's gift. A few years ago, golden year, the ex prime minister told this famous joke. Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil. Golda Meir, well, it sure looks like this is no longer the case and to this discovery, the fact that Israel is one of the most innovative countries in the world and it's entirely possible, it could soon become one of the world's wealthiest countries. Oh, it's also probably important that we mentioned another player here. Can you guess who were the first to have an interest in these reserves? It was the Russians. Yep. Again, really Gazprom actually tried to buy them. This all indicates that Israel could take part of the Russian gas market share in Europe, and as you already know, energy means money and influence new allies.

Speaker 1:          07:04          The international situation of Israel, it's always been controversial, was political conflict. The UN resolutions, the Israeli Minister of foreign affairs has to work harder than Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Consider the last events from the UN. UN Security Council passes resolution demanding end to Israeli settlements. Well, despite all of this, the truth is that Israeli foreign policy is stronger than ever. Israeli authorities are determined to put an end to their dependence on the United States and these recent gas and oil discoveries have certainly helps. For example, relations with their neighboring countries have improved quickly and by a great amount in 2010 relations with Turkey, you broke down almost completely when Israel approached the freedom flow tiller, but now these relations at being healed. This probably has a lot to do with the fact that Erdogan is country uses up massive quantities of natural gas and they're important agreements with the Russia will be over in just five years and we already know how unstable relations are lately between these two countries.

Speaker 1:          08:01          Things are also working out great with their other neighbors. Egypt and Jordan. Israel hasn't just become Jordan's major gas supplier, but the relations with Egypt are working so well that shall keep the minister of Foreign Affairs Watch footballs, European Championship final in the residence of the Israeli prime minister. Further the unimaginable it could even be happening. Some are talking about reconciliation between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israel, Saudi Arabia are reportedly negotiating economic ties. Israel is also bonding with Tsipras Greece, which has surprisingly the come a close ally. In fact, the Israeli air force is now training in Greece, but the really major change has been from the east ends in this process. India was key. India has made Israel its second largest arms supplier behind Russia in the last decade. India has bought from Israel more than $10,000,000,000 of military equipment. Their relations are so good. In fact, so this in 2015 for the first time in history, the president of India went to Israel on an official visit. All right. Jump Modi to become first Indian prime minister to visit. I'm. Let's just add one more thing on their subjects. Up until now, Greece and India had been very critical of Israel as a consequence of the situation with Palestine, so you can imagine what a step this was for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and India is not the only one. Israel is also building a close relationship with China and they own negotiating a free trade agreements. It's the only Chinese businessman then making strong investments in the country and think even building a port in the city of Ashdod as part of their Silk Road Jack,

Speaker 1:          09:40          so their relationships developing with Vietnam, South Korea. It really seems that anywhere in Asia, Israel is a total success only we haven't forgotten about Donald Trump who for now mez committed to this.

Speaker 3:          09:52          It's our true friend over there and we're going to protect Israel 100 percent

Speaker 1:          09:57          anyway. There's still a long way to go for Israel to become an energy power, but if they do, it will have a positive effect for the area's stability, which think would be a very good thing. Indeed. Israel is well on its way to becoming a great country, but there are still some things that need to be dealt with like the conflict in Palestine. Luckily better relations with Arabic countries could help in this matter a lot. So now what do you think? Do you think that this new energy wealth will contribute to the solution of this conflict?
