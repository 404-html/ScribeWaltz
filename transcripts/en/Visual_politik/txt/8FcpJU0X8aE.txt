Speaker 1:          00:00          It's finally here off several failures and a few scandals. 2017 closed with Donald Trump hands, the republican party's first major political victory since the presidential elections that landed the well known casino and property developments magnate in the Oval Office. Oh, of course. Talking about the tax reform that after being approved by Congress was signed by President Trump on December the 22nd 2017

Speaker 2:          00:26          three point $2 trillion in tax cuts for American families, including the doubling of the standard deduction and the doubling of the child tax credit.

Speaker 1:          00:37          This is, as I'm sure you've heard, the largest tax reform in 30 years. The impacts and the controls have been massive, and that's appropriate for the importance of this political

Speaker 3:          00:48          events.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Print supporters. The tax reform is a real revolution, as many qualifiers as the biggest tax reduction in the history of the United States. This is good for American business. It's good for the American economy, and it's good for the American people for its detractors. However, the reform is poorly developed and lies far from the promises that the president made during his electoral campaign

Speaker 2:          01:13          tax. The florists. People. Okay. All right. Other 35,000 book will be taxed the most under 75,000 will be the second highest tech and the billionaires and the millionaires get a tax guy. What's wrong with this picture?

Speaker 1:          01:28          So I think the questions to be asked here are very clear. We have to ask what's true in all of this, what's it really all about and is it as large as people are saying? And ultimately what can everyone expect from this? Well, let's have a look.

Speaker 3:          01:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:49          In this video where they explored the positive and also the not so positive aspects of a reform that is its first consequence as managed to calm the waters in the Republican party in a way, reconcile Donald Trump with the party leaders of both chambers of Congress and given how things were going after a year of taunts attacks and mistrust, this is really worth acknowledging. Check out what the media says. Just a few short months ago,

Speaker 4:          02:12          president had been a very focused, of course on a well his twitter account. He fired off another twitter storm yesterday about his frustrations with party leaders, Mitch Mcconnell and Paul Ryan. I with all the invitee? No, in the GOP. Do Democrats have a political advantage now?

Speaker 1:          02:28          Well, before we go on, what can we expect? Let's see what this law at tax reduction within the United States really means. Well, the first question we need to answer is how much does it really actually reduce taxes? Is this really the biggest tax drop in US history? Now, Donald Trump certainly has his steak today. It was my great honor to sign the largest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. So according to the president and also many Republican Party politicians, Americans are facing a great fiscal revolution. A revolution that could make even Ronald Reagan's cuts look pretty tiny

Speaker 5:          03:00          is this is the biggest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. This is bigger than actually president Reagan's. How

Speaker 1:          03:08          ever dear viewer, before you launch your celebration, please do wait a minute because we already know that donald isn't particularly fond of the truth and well, you know what? While this time it's really not any different.

Speaker 3:          03:25          Yes,

Speaker 1:          03:25          sadly that is right. This fiscal reform isn't the largest in US history. Indeed not at all. In fact, it's not even among the top five.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Allow me to explain, even though we can say that Americans are facing the biggest tax system reform in 30 years, because this law does change a lot of things. The truth is that when it comes to lowering taxes, it's really not that impressive. The general estimates is that this reform, we'll lower taxes between 0.7 and 0.9% of the GDP over the next 10 years. That is approximately one point $5 trillion. Well, the fact is, according to the committee for a responsible federal budget and independent think tank and also according to the u s treasury, this is actually the eighth largest tax reduction since 1918 indeed it is three times smaller than Reagan. Yes, indeed. The problem here, it may actually be the Donald Trump is simply allergic to the trees,

Speaker 3:          04:18          but anyway.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Nice. What are the main points of this tax reduction and what are its benefits? Well. Let's dive into those right now the reforms highlights, even though there are a lot of changes, there are really only two main points to consider here. One is lowering income tax. That is to see the tax that affects natural persons, just regular man on the streets and the other is the changes to corporate tax first case, but natural persons. This reduction is really, really small. C, 80% of taxpayers will see an income tax change of less than 2% and most won't even really notice it. And regarding this matter, trump has blatantly broken his word.

Speaker 3:          05:06          So

Speaker 1:          05:06          why is this? Well, because Donald Trump promised a new tax system a much simpler one with only three or four brackets and much lower, right? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          05:14          we're going to cut the individual rate from seven brackets

Speaker 3:          05:19          to form.

Speaker 1:          05:25          In the end, things have virtually remained the same with seven brackets kind of rates slightly lower than before. And that's not all this reduction. It's also temporary. Yeah, that's right. This is going to disappear in 2025 unless Congress changes what it is approved. By the way. One very interesting thing about this law is that it limits deductions for state and local taxes. That is, it punishes states with higher taxes and encourages them to lower them. Now on the other hands, we have the reduction of corporate income tax, which is so to speak, the jewel, the reform,

Speaker 6:          06:05          yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:05          The tax decreases from 35% to 21% and it changes its scoped so that it ceases to be global and to facts almost exclusively. The United States allow me to explain myself because this is really important to up until now, when American multinationals such as apple or Google, made money abroad as for example they do in Ireland, despite having already paid taxes to the Irish governments, they had to pay again in the u s for what they had earned in islands. If they wanted to bring the money into the United States. Essentially they were paying twice for any money they were bringing home. Now, of course, these companies weren't really very willing to do that, so you could probably guess what happened next. Well these companies, they simply didn't repatriate their income to the United States as the cancer didn't. Financial centers like Luxembourg, Ireland or Singapore and the figures, they're pretty dizzying. We're talking about more than two point $5 trillion here. Well, the fact is that from now on, thanks to this reform, US multinationals will only pay the u s treasury for income they make within the country and for the money that's already outside the new law states that they can bring it home as a very attractive conditions. As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can't bring it back into this gun. So indeed, it's highly likely that this year we're going to begin to see it. Large amounts of money moving towards the United States

Speaker 1:          07:28          away. As a side note, evenly, the corporate income tax decreased from 35% 21% that isn't actually that big of a drop. On the one hand, while the tax rates do decrease, some deductions eliminated or limited, and those deductions previously allowed companies to pay an average of 20% before the reform. On the other hand though, the old US income tax was the highest in the OEC. D If we take into account all the taxes companies pays not only on income. The truth is that although the United States pays a lot of taxes, Europe's are usually even higher. For example, the ones in Spain, France or even Janet.

Speaker 1:          08:06          I would even say even if it isn't as impressive as the republican state, it will have positive consequences for the u s economy from now on the country. It will be more attractive to investors. It's companies will earn more money and a lot of income that was previously retained, a broad, we'll begin to move to the United States, so do you use all of this and due to some other smaller changes, just this once and certainly without setting a precedence here at visual politic we can say trump seems to be doing well in terms of tactics.

Speaker 3:          08:36          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          08:36          If you think that's it, you are very, very wrong. The reform also certainly has its negative points.

Speaker 3:          08:48          The shadows, those

Speaker 1:          08:52          who followed this channel? No, that we usually say that things aren't as pretty as they seem. Well that is precisely the case with this tax reform law. On the one hand, the positive effects of this log will most likely be much more limited than the Republican party claims. And why is this? Well, allow me to

Speaker 3:          09:08          you.

Speaker 1:          09:09          It's economy is growing at a good pace. That is almost full employment and corporate profits are historically high. That is to say right now American companies which are already very competitive, mostly need fewer regulations, the ability to trade freely and the freedom to hire the workers they need, including the best talents they can get from abroad. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          09:34          MMM.

Speaker 1:          09:36          As you probably know, trump doesn't exactly play that way. So yeah, the reform will have positive effects, but not as many as some people do. Think while it is not the largest tax cut ever, it is the most poorly timed tax cut in history. The economy is near full employment and the national debt is it postwar record and rising fast. Leonard Eberman Tax Policy Center, cofounder and institute fellow at the Urban Institute. On the other hand, this government isn't talking about reducing public spending. Indeed, on the contrary, they want to increase public spending on infrastructure and the military, and of course with fewer taxes. This means more deficits and more public debt as well. If we're honest, the U S has quite a track record of that. And lastly, develop deep forgotten party in this reform is of course, the middle class. That's right. The ones who will benefit the most from this reform will be the wealthiest classes, including, of course, Donald Trump himself

Speaker 2:          10:33          in the center of the stage tonight. There's this man Donald Trump.

Speaker 1:          10:40          Am I allowed to accept it?

Speaker 2:          10:44          Had Rich Friends of mine come up to me and say, Donald, you're doing this tax plan. We don't want anything. We don't

Speaker 1:          10:55          president. Consider that he and his companies would benefit so well from this reform. Well, I'm going to leave that for you too.

Speaker 3:          11:02          Sit Up. The Republican Party

Speaker 1:          11:04          has betrayed working families. This tax scam takes billions of dollars away from the middleclass, enhance it over to Republican donors and wealthy corporations while mortgaging away the future of our economy by adding one point $5 trillion in debt. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Maybe this is why Paul stayed, that most Americans do not really like this change. The general perception that seems to be that this reform, it was made by and forth the richest. In fact, unlike what we might expect, many Democratic Party leaders are rubbing their hands together and thinking that this may favor them in the mid term elections, which will be held in November. Only time it's going to tell. But what we think is that this reform will make us companies more attractive and that's in principle is a very good thing. Of course, as things are, the US needs many more measures which trump has ruled out. But on the other hand, there may be time for the United States to begin taking their public debts terrifying growth much more seriously. And by the way, just as a final note yet, with this reform, we all kind of win in away. You see, if the United States reduces its taxes, it's also been shown historically that other governments will be unwilling to raise.

Speaker 2:          12:08          That's,
