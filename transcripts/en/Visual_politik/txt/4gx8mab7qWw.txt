Speaker 1:          00:00          How can the country overcome a crisis? How can it reinvents itself, change itself and transform. These are two of the questions you have asked us in the comments section here on visual politic as well as a viewer. I think we can say that the economy usually evolves three cycles. That is a growth phase is sooner or laser always followed by a crisis and then this crisis is followed again by a new growth phase and so on and so

Speaker 2:          00:25          both.

Speaker 1:          00:29          For example, since World War Two, the United States has undergone 11 complete economic cycles. That is both growth and crisis years.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39          How has my friends things on always have that simple? Sometimes leaving a crisis is very, very hard. So much so that decades could go by so much so that even a rich and prosperous country can stop being a rich and prosperous country because don't think that this only effects emerging countries, not at all. The richest countries can suffer this type of deep crisis, usually due to political reasons or rather bad policies, but he has to view our country can't even escape these deepest of crises or his hair on visual politic with, for example, the case of New Zealand's, which after undergoing a very harsh crisis, managed to completely overturn the situation.

Speaker 2:          01:29          Well,

Speaker 1:          01:30          in this video we're going to show you another example and that would be the example of Canada. Yep. You heard me right? Did you know that Canada almost went bankrupt? Well, if you didn't listen up Canada is one of the richest freest and most prosperous countries with the highest quality of life on the planet. It doesn't even matter what ranking we use. It can be the United Nations Hdi, the corruption perception index of Transparency International, the Fraser Institute, Human Freedom Index, or the legatum prosperity index in all of them. Canada is always among the highest on the list, but this video isn't about rankings, but before we move on, I just do want to touch on one last one very quickly. See in the latest ranking of the best countries prepared to buy us news magazine and the Wharton School Canada appears as the second best country to live in in the world. Pretty clear as we already saw it on this channel, that Canada, dear viewer, is very, very popular right now. How are the things in Canada once always this happy? There was a time in the 1960s and especially in the 1970s where everything was about to collapse. Disaster. Yes. Can I do? It was very similar to the United States. It was practically it's twin brother. It had a very small governments. The country was very decentralized and taxes were very similar. Of course, the idea then was to compete to attract investments and thus also people from abroad, immigrants. However, this all changed in the 1960s at that time, Canada sought to distance itself from the United States and to try a new political and economic model. The great architects of this revolution was Pierre Trudeau. Yup. That's the father of the current prime minister, Justin Trudeau.

Speaker 3:          03:44          We can forever spend more than we obtained from tax.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Of course father and sons. Politics aren't by no means the same. It looks like just trudeau sets and he did his homework, but let's not straight from the subject too much.

Speaker 1:          04:06          The fact is that just introduce father govern Canada virtually uninterrupted between 1968 in 1984 and the fact is that throughout the 16 years in power, the country changed a great deal. Today I've seen you out once. You do implement a new political model in Canada, which was a bit difference from Washington's capitalism and somewhat closer to Sylvia Moscow's collectivism as against the invisible hand of Adam Smith, there has to be a visible hand of politicians whose objective it is to have the kind of society that is caring and humane. Pierre Trudeau in facts in international politics. One of the things the prime minister was best known for was his close friendship with Fidel Castro.

Speaker 1:          04:49          In any case, the truth is that we could say that Trudeau's father went a bit far, he raised taxes a lot. He increased public spending, he nationalized companies. And because he thought that all international trade and investment was bad due to competition, he decided to set up barriers. So speaking of barriers, well who does that sound like? President trump slap new tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels. If that wasn't enough, he also made the central bank prints banknotes despair to expand credit and finance the government. And well, maybe this recipe is starting to sound a bit familiar to you. Well, Venezuela's adding more zeroes to its currency, it releasing bills with larger denominations. Well, the results of all of this, Divya, is that within a few years, the deficits, unemployment, and inflation rates to put the whole country up against the ropes. So of course when in 1984 Pierre Trudeau left office, he did see with the lowest popularity level for a Canadian prime minister in decades, only two out of every 10 Canadians still supported him. And it was at this time that Canadian citizens have to make a really important decision. The chain in the September, 1984 elections, the conservatives won an overwhelming victory. It was clear that the country could not continue along Trudeau's path. The new prime minister, Brian Mulroney, decided to reverse the situation and began to strengthen ties with President Ronald Reagan. A new era had begun over the next 10 years. The conservative government did many things to improve Canada's economy. For example, lower taxes negotiated NAFTA, the North American free trade agreements that Unites Canada, the u s and Mexico, and following in Margaret Thatcher's footsteps, they launched an ambitious plan to privatize large public companies such as Air Canada and its Petro Canada.

Speaker 4:          06:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:54          However, he didn't do one thing, the most difficult and some popular action, and that was controlling public spending. In 1990 the state held more than half of the economy taxes. We're still very high and there was a huge public deficits and further public debt rose rapidly. Conservatives had taken the easiest measures bus at the moment of truth. They hadn't really shown much commitments. Therefore, in the following 1993 elections, Piatra jury is leftist Liberal Party won the elections again. This time it promising a true revolution. Could Pediatric Dose Party Save Canada

Speaker 2:          07:31          given it

Speaker 1:          07:33          backgrounds? You cons and I, this would have been very difficult to imagine. That's, well, everything was really different at this time. The new governments wanted to completely change the country's model once and for all and no, they no longer wanted anything to do with Moscow or the Soviet model is. The main idea was that quality of life wasn't only related to the economy, it was dependent on it. If they wanted to achieve on a quality of life, they needed to strengthen Canada's economy and that's essentially what they did, especially under the minister of Finance. Paul Martin feet, true change promoter. Well, the fact is that for the first few years, the leftist government launched a sharp public spending cuts, eliminated many unnecessary programs and adjusted spending. For example, these strongly reduced military spending and many companies subsidy

Speaker 1:          08:21          just two years in real times, spending drops by 15% under the principle, which states that the state shouldn't do things that companies can do better if the government decided to continue with the privatization plan in which they went as far as privatizing the railways and even the aviation management system. Anne's no planes in Canada did not fall out of the sky and no, there haven't been more accidents than they have been in other countries. Indeed, on the contrary, Canada's aviation management system is considered one of the best in the world. The fact is that in just four years, the situation was under control. The governments had gone from having a deficits to having a sub lists. I mean, check out this graphic.

Speaker 1:          09:04          Of course, as you can imagine, these measures, they weren't easy. But one thing that seemed to be very clear to Canadians say much so if that's in the 1997 elections, the liberal leftist party won again by promising still more careful and government spending and on this occasion fewer taxes as they said, their role was to protect and give opportunities to the most disenfranchised and not to waste everyone's money. It all seems pretty sensible, don't you think? Well, listen to Paul Martin's words in 2003 as he reviewed that 10 years in power, we have to build it.

Speaker 5:          09:35          21st century economy in Canada for Canadians. We succeeded in the last 10 years because we did not deviate from our course. Balanced budgets, uh, continually dropping debt ratio, lower taxes. We must stay on that course. We must be a government committed to accountability of government that treats taxpayers' money like it is your money, Paul Martin. This revolution was a real turning points in Canada's history.

Speaker 2:          09:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:09          to the country experienced in the 1980s and especially in the 90s, allowed for this country's situation to change completely. Canada went from being considered an honorary member of the Third World by the Wall Street Journal due to its public debt problems to becoming the most fashionable country in the world. We'll potsy howdens only solve the country's problems. They had changed its model in the following years up until today, all political options opt for the Canadian model. Mind you, Canada is no tax haven far from us because they have understood that companies need to be cared for and is not punished. Check this out.

Speaker 2:          10:47          Jobs

Speaker 1:          10:52          you had that rights. If we take all taxes that companies pay into accounts, this country situation is actually very advantageous. In fact, Canada is one of the few developed countries that has been decreasing as taxes for almost 20 years to make the country more competitive and consider for example, how company taxes have evolved and this policy has mostly favored. The weakest salaries have grown a lot and this is one of the countries that receives the most immigrants and employment rates are very high. In addition, if all of this weren't enough in recent years, Canada has also become a world civil liberties champion as we saw her a visual policy in a previous video.

Speaker 1:          11:35          And this Divya is how Canada managed to escape its greatest crisis. And by the way, just as it happened in New Zealand and Australia, these reforms were carried out by leftist parties. But this isn't about left or right. It's about understanding that a strong competitive and globally open economy is the best to improve everyone's quality of life. But having said that, now it's your turn.
