Speaker 1:          00:07          Yeah, the travel to Spain. Have you ever visited Barcelona in the or? Maybe the Canary Islands? Well, if you have ensure there is something isn't much. Have surprised you decide the facts. That scene isn't a crisis. And as the second highest unemployment rates in all of Europe and a wealthy country facilities, uh, clean the roads of brand new pavements, there are international airports and every other city and this state of the art high speed train network throughout most of the time.

Speaker 2:          00:31          Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:34          At least on the surface. Madrid has no reasons to be jealous of Zurich London. Then again, we also came out as a country that was at the edge of bankruptcy, not such a long time and go and now has gone through one of the biggest political crisis in their recent history.

Speaker 3:          00:53          Premier will have to leave the government. Congress has passed and impeachment bill

Speaker 1:          00:59          impeachment means that the congress, that is the legislative power loops to kick the executive out. Unlike other countries like America in Spain, you need to propose an alternative governments that will substitute for the format. This makes impeachments attempts almost impossible to pull off in this country, but these all strange days and Spanish political life's the brand new Spanish presidents and the Social Democrats, Padre Sanchez has managed to convince the radical left the nationalist right, and so the independent Catalunian parties to vote against the conservative government of Marianna at a height they will have one thing in common. They didn't want more of this,

Speaker 4:          01:39          and now you might be wondering, why did Roy have so many haters? Well, while you might think it's corruption, and of course this is the official reason, but beyond the surface, that's way more of that. As we said before, Spain is one of the most damaged countries from the big financial crisis of 2008, and the forming government likes to brag about that economic achievements with statements like this one

Speaker 3:          02:04          been an honor to leave this country in better shape than I found it. Marianna over to Hawaii.

Speaker 1:          02:09          This is why in today's video we have a lot of questions to cover. First has gotten over the crisis already. Science and economic growth and unemployment reduction. This country still has more than 16 percent unemployment rates and other countries like Ireland driving faster than stain, so can we really save that they've left the financial crisis behinds and if so, what credit because we give to the conservative

Speaker 4:          02:33          governments also. Is it a good moment to invest in Spain today? We're going to answer with these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history

Speaker 2:          02:44          black.

Speaker 1:          02:45          In the year 2002, the eurozone was created. All of the sudden Spain, Germany, France, and many other countries started to use the same currency, the euro, and the same interest rates. The ones that the European central bank fixes. This seems to be a great idea. Having the same currency, a German bank and lends money to a Spanish company on the same conditions as they wish a German company, but these advantages come with a risk. If Spain goes bankrupt, this German bank with Spanish debt might get bankrupts too. In other words, if a country does poorly, they might spread to the problems to other countries.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Swipe. When you join the euro, you must follow some rules. One of them is that no country can have a deficit. They got them three percent. This means they cannot spend more than what they collect in taxes. They said, let's fast forward to listening in history to the year 2008, the year of the international financial crisis. Many European countries suffer this pain among them. Suddenly the unemployment rate goes sky high until it's the pasta 20 percent. This means that all of a sudden the government collects little money in taxes during that, those international apolis and high speed trains. I told you about, well, assassinating not cheap, and this is why the inevitable happened.

Speaker 3:          04:00          Spain, Greece, and Ireland had the highest budget deficits in the EU in 2012.

Speaker 4:          04:06          Maximum deficits at urec country could have was three percent saying 10 percent. This meant nobody wanted to lend money to their governments. At the end of the day, are you going to pay it back when you spend 10 percent more than what you collect? If you've followed visual politics for a long time, you already know what happens when investors don't trust your credit reliability, rice, and see

Speaker 1:          04:26          what did they do well? Yep, exactly. They asked for higher interest rates. Now listen, up in the euro zone, we have an index to measure the chances of a country to forcing. It's the so called risk.

Speaker 2:          04:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Basically what they do is take the most trustworthy debts, phones that exists in Europe. This is the German bonds. Then they can pay the interest rate of the German bonds with the interest rates of the other ones. The number that against with this comparison is called the risk premium, so in the year 2010, the Spanish debt at a risk premium of 50 points, and this was okay, but one year later it had 250, which is five times more

Speaker 3:          05:11          Spanish bonds at brisk as contained gathers force,

Speaker 1:          05:14          and this is where the men in black came into the eviction. Yes. The men in black wasn't an given by the journalist to the European Central Bank workers. These ECV people. When's the most problematic countries in the euro zone and requested that they follow the rules. Basically what they said was, it says right here that you concept the deficit bigger than three percent, but your giving crazy stop wasting money or will punish you.

Speaker 4:          05:39          In countries like Ireland, these men in black where especially strict and some even forced the parliaments of choose another prime minister who was more fiscally responsible, but one of them is insane. What did these men in black do

Speaker 1:          05:52          in the country of Sangria and Pieta? November the 20th, 2011. This is the day when these Spanish people's party kicks us in the elections. The Conservative leader, Mariana or Ohio becomes one of the most supportive leaders in Europe and he supposed to buy it. Viktor Orban in Hungary, the Spanish people's Party. Your as it's fascinating, pep got 53 percent of the seats in Congress ends. They ruled in most of the regional government.

Speaker 4:          06:35          Basically Mr Roy was so popular that he could have probably gotten away with changing the name of Spain to recoil lands.

Speaker 1:          06:42          So what was this political program during the elections? Well, basically Roy sent to the European Central Bank

Speaker 4:          06:47          guys, don't worry unconservative, so I know my economics first going to reduce taxes and then I'm going to make loads of business friendly reforms that would make this country like silicon valley than those companies helped people make billions hoppy

Speaker 1:          07:01          and same deficit problem solves. All right guys. Basically the whole campaign was based on the idea of like taxes. The mantra for any problem was to reduce taxes and everything

Speaker 3:          07:18          by most important.

Speaker 4:          07:30          Did you know the. What they say during the electoral campaign is one thing and what they do one day after taking office is another thing entirely.

Speaker 3:          07:41          Government must raise some taxes for some time in Florida.

Speaker 4:          07:48          During the months of Roy, the government raised the taxes including VAT, income tax and all the special taxes on tobacco in gasoline. Yup. A Conservative government made the biggest tax increase in Spanish history. I want about all of these wonderful business regulations that would turn Spain into the new silicon valley. Well, you can imagine what happens with that one. So what happens when you promise a business friendly agenda and it's come up with the opposite ones here in office? Well, devices, they get angry, but there's nothing they can really do until the next election. But the international investors, they can give you their backs the very moment you break that trust, and this is exactly what happened in Spain.

Speaker 3:          08:30          Spanish academy in huge crisis after credit downgrade.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Basically the Spanish debt bombs fell into the category of trash. You remember about that risk premium that I told you about earlier. So at some points it went to the Satanic Sega of six, six, six, many Spanish banks were to the edge of bankruptcy and no one wanted to buy any Spanish debt. Spain, it was about to collapse and that would mean no money to pay doctors, school teachers, and tax collectors. Only one team though anyone could solve this problem.

Speaker 2:          09:02          Black

Speaker 5:          09:05          to accept rescue from Europe for an ailing banks.

Speaker 1:          09:08          So what was this all about? Basically, Europe would lend money at a lower interest rate, so Spanish banks could not go bankrupt. In exchange, they requested the government to cut spending. And here is where did his big bad ass movement, or as we like to call it, roughly and nomics basically, once the European Central Bank had already nailed down, the banks were highly to those men in black and set essentially.

Speaker 4:          09:33          What's up dudes, you think you could tell me what to do. Look at these bad boys.

Speaker 1:          09:42          Siri was the stainless too big to fail. So despite having the worst credit rating, you can imagine the European Central Bank would eventually buy all the debt bonds without asking to any interest rates. How well printing money with this money Stan could keep being as it was, without making any costly reforms that well. Now the question is, why would the ECB acceptable of this? That's actually easy because stain has the fourth biggest economy in Europe and nobody's going to let it fail. Sorry. The months while they kept passing, unemployment's kept growing and so did that risk premium. The conservative governments of the People's party far from making business friendly reforms. They did about an example prior to them. The professional services like taxi drivers were going to the liberalized insane taxi driver. Associations are well connected with the conservative, so the right wing pasta bill to protect taxi drivers from competition. This is why many sharing economy companies like either an Addie and dee now have many, many restrictions in the Spanish market. The question is

Speaker 4:          10:47          the real challenge the European Central Bank works and the answer is,

Speaker 5:          10:51          Oh yeah, these say B is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro and believe me, it wouldn't be enough for Mario comes to the rescue

Speaker 1:          11:10          four months, the ECB president's, Mario Draghi said he would not compromise with stain. Basically rewired wanted him to print more money so he could buy a Spanish desks and otherwise Roy wanted the wealthier countries like Germany and sendlane's do give money to stain at no political cost just because, well apparently reasons it doesn't sound very fair, does it? Well, sometimes three rounds he has. Life's not fair and Roy, he was right. Spain, Mr.

Speaker 2:          11:39          thanks

Speaker 5:          11:42          b could be ready to buy week Italian Spanish bonds.

Speaker 1:          11:45          Since then, 25 percent of the Spanish debt is in ECB hands and those words from Mario Draghi saying he would do whatever it takes to save the euro like magic. One day at a time the risk premium of Spain started falling. Investors don't in buying debt phones because they knew they had the backing of the ECB, and this is stain could keep piling on more and more debt. This country now has a depth that represents more than a hundred percent of that entire GDP. Meanwhile, the rest of the European countries have started growing.

Speaker 4:          12:21          Two Thousand and 12 Gemini has become the biggest export powerhouse in the entire wells. China has gone from being the world sanctuary to developing brands, new consumer market where everybody can sell their products. In other words, every European country is growing now and that of course does include Spain. Nonetheless, this was good news is every government's like good news.

Speaker 3:          12:45          Spain has got over the crisis in record time.

Speaker 1:          12:48          This is already 2015 in this. Yes. Staying at elections again and the government decides to celebrate at the end of the crisis with a tax cut in the middle of the electoral campaign. Pretty Brilliant News, right? You raise taxes at the beginning of one election and then one year before the next election you put them where they used to be. I think that's what happened right after he won the elections again. Yeah. Guess

Speaker 2:          13:10          right?

Speaker 3:          13:13          Is his taxes again in 2017, the government will have to cut $15 million in its deficit.

Speaker 1:          13:20          Is it going? Imagine raising and reducing taxes depending on when you have elections is not the best policy. If you want to attract foreign investors and red tape, that's almost the same if not more prevalent than before, and if you consider all the territorial problems, you'll understand why the unemployment rate in stain is still a 16 percent.

Speaker 2:          13:41          Other countries

Speaker 1:          13:42          he's in the eurozone like Estonia and islands, which had really bad recessions are now way better than 10 years ago. While Spain remains though.

Speaker 4:          13:53          Now it's your son. Do you think that the brand new Spanish government can do any worse than the previous one? Do you think Spain has sold its crisis?
