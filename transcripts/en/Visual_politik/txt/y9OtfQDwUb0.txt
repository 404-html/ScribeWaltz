Speaker 1:          00:08          There's the world's getting better or worse, is globalization good or bad is the way we relate to each other? Seem like simple questions, but they're answers concealed very divergent ways by which we understand the world. For those who regularly follow this channel, I'm convinced that you know that we are quite optimistic. Here abouts are planets in general here at visual politic. We are convinced and the analytical data that seems to corroborate this, but we live in a world that is improving and will be better in the future. However, that does not mean that that on no problems, I mean obviously there are some of these are as serious as this. We are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the United Nations in 1945. Now more than 20 million people across four countries face starvation and famine. Yes, of course, there are still many problems on this planet. Well, within recent years, globalization has become, in most cases, the culprit of everything and the scapegoat for all of our centers.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Unemployment's relocation, poverty, inequality. For many people, these are the consequences of a process of global integration, which more and more people think has gone too far. The numbers are quite clear. Every time a survey has done, most people think that the world is getting worse and this is happening in a way because of globalization. Do you want an example? Well, in 2016 study was published in the economist that found that less than half of Americans, Brits and the French leaved that this whole process was a good thing and as we have seen here, a visual politic, all this growing unpopularity of globalization has been exploited in practically every corner of the world by all kinds of politicians, politicians who oppose immigration. You opposed free trade and oppose ultimately well, everything that's difference. However, on this occasion, it is not a matter of political color in both rightwing parties and left wing parties. We find this type of discourse. Perhaps a good example was the elections in the United States where we saw how both Donald Trump and the democratic primary candidates, Bernie Sanders defendants in one way or another, this sort of speech which can be summarized in a sentence as globalization is destroying our society.

Speaker 2:          02:29          It used to be cars were made in flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in flint

Speaker 3:          02:48          since 2001, we have seen over 50,000 factories in America shut down millions of workers,

Speaker 1:          03:00          right? Millions of workers have lost decent paying jobs,

Speaker 4:          03:05          but then America changed his policy from promoting development in America and in, in America to promoting development in other nations

Speaker 1:          03:24          with political movements that in recent years have spread like wildfire. I arena has emerged a widespread perception that says that globalization is stopping. So I think the question we have to answer here is this, what is really happening with globalization? Are we facing a paradigm change? Well, that's have a look.

Speaker 4:          03:48          The break

Speaker 1:          03:51          last seven decades since the Second World War and globalization has accelerated constantly. And with it the movement of people, goods and capital all over the world.

Speaker 2:          04:01          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          04:04          All these years, many political barriers to trade have been eliminated for a company to have factories or sell products in a country produced thousands of kilometers away. Well, it's become totally normal. Suddenly wherever you live, eating Sushi, pizza and Nachos with molly or even drinking a heineken has become the most normal thing in the wells. Almost a tradition in itself, like a I didn't come. There might be a handicap,

Speaker 2:          04:29          no.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Or even those who predicted that national borders would become a thing of the past. However, perhaps the culminating moments of all this culture because in December of 2001 when China joins the World Trade Organization, that is when China really integrated into the world economy and became something of a factory to the wells. However, when the financial crisis, suddenly things started to change according to data between 2011 and 2015, the value of the world's exports plummeted by 10 percent. This is according to the WTO, and it's not only that, according to Mckinsey, the annual capital movements, this is stocks, bonds, foreign investments or loans collapsed more than 60 percent between 2007 and 2015 addition the crisis and all those politicians you consider the trade is a zero sum game web. Some wind and others always lose. Have results. In recent years in protectionist regulations becoming fashionable once again.

Speaker 4:          05:31          From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first

Speaker 2:          05:49          business

Speaker 1:          05:50          leaders are scrambling to adjust to world few imagined possible just a year ago. The Myth of a borderless world has come crashing Pankaj Ghemawat. According to the global trade alert panel that monitors how government's taken measures that affects trades since 2008, more than 8,000 protectionist regulations have been put into play. Wait just a moment because although it does seem true that in recent years international traders lost strength, this is not entirely true, not true for two main reasons. First, instead of seeing what has happened since the crisis, let's take a slightly longer period of time. For example, since the year 2000. So if we look at what is happening in the 21st century, it so happens that both trade and investments have grown seconds. While you know what, in 2017, globalization is returning with strength, right? In recent years, there has been a revolution that not even Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin has been able to put a stop to a revolution that will make our world look a whole lot smaller. Digital globalization

Speaker 1:          07:10          trade has been around for a number of years, but now international data traffic has exploded in the United States alone. 80 terabytes of data enter and leave the country every minute. A gigantic number that is eight times the content of the library of Congress, of the United States, which is one of the largest libraries in the world, and all of that's happening every single minute. Emails, skype calls, social networks. According to Mckinsey, international data flow is more important to the economy than the trade of goods. For example, facebook has just exceeded the 2 billion active users, mark off favorite platform. Youtube breaks its own historical records every single year. They may seem too little, but the truth is that the business they generate is absolutely huge. Take another example. Anytime to have 10 readers of the Financial Times, one of the most important economic newspapers in the world from countries other than the UK to have Amazon or Alibaba, which are full of entrepreneurs from all backgrounds who are all working to sell their products. In addition today, we can have designers or by video games, through online platforms and this friends. It's only just begun according to Oxford Economics and HSBC. International Trade in services will triple in the next 15 years. Just taking a look at this graphic.

Speaker 2:          08:37          Okay. It's

Speaker 1:          08:45          a pretty interesting result. Don't you think? These laminates and my husband, this is one. That's God. I see my blood every night

Speaker 5:          08:57          because my brother.

Speaker 1:          09:14          The fact is that if we consider all of this, it turns out that the global connection, the degree of integration that exists in the world today is higher than in 2007. Just before the outbreak of the great global crisis, the truth is that each day that passes brings us into a much more connected world. Now, I'm sorry for those of you don't like it, but globalization, it's not going to go away. Indeed. It's only going to grow. In fact, we'd now like to pose the question, is it possible that despite politicians like Donald Trump, we are at the door of a new boost for global integration nosotros in a. It was those

Speaker 2:          09:54          no new sunrise

Speaker 1:          10:08          possible, that if you asked us how we see the future of globalization and free trade, we would respond negatively as we've seen in this video. This is what most people seem to think. However, surprisingly, governance, they don't seem to share that

Speaker 2:          10:20          opinion.

Speaker 1:          10:24          Latin America, for example, the breaking down of terrorists and restrictions is again becoming fashion

Speaker 2:          10:29          cool.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Argentina and Chile side, the most ambitious free trade agreement in 20 years, wallscape took the lead in the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015, which aims to improve the economic status of the countries that make up these so called Russian area of influence.

Speaker 2:          10:48          No,

Speaker 1:          10:48          Russia, ballerinas, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, not all part of this alliance. Indeed, the European Union itself has also launched its most ambitious free trade program.

Speaker 2:          10:57          Yes.

Speaker 1:          11:00          Given all this antiglobalization talking might be surprised to hear that. Well, you shouldn't be because the European Union has just signed a trade agreement with Canada and it's about to do the same with Singapore and Vietnam and it's also made progress in negotiations with Microsoft as well as beginning to negotiate with Australia and New Zealand's even China wants to strengthen its commercial commitments. In fact, it is demanding that the World Trade Organization recognize it as a market economy. You see when in 2001 trying to join the WTO, it did so under its economic status, not market status, and it was agreed that 15 years later this condition would be reviewed.

Speaker 2:          11:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:39          All that time has come. We're talking about a technicality that allows the rest of the WTO countries such as the United States or EU members, to impose protectionist measures in their relations with

Speaker 2:          11:49          no, for example,

Speaker 1:          11:53          anti dumping measures

Speaker 2:          11:54          or to restrict imports of cars manufacturers in the Asian giants. China achieves its purpose and is recognized as a full market economy and that is something that will happen eventually we will see how it's commercial relations with the rest of the world are going to have another important step 10

Speaker 1:          12:12          street that people listened to, a lot of protectionist politicians and critics of globalization, but events. They're going to take other paths. In any case, we think this is a good thing, thanks to globalization and the integration of peoples in the last 25 years, we have lived through the periods in which poverty has been reduced the most in the entire of human history.

Speaker 6:          12:31          Nor do they view that they the one all told me to ask

Speaker 1:          13:02          more than a billion people have escaped. Extreme needs in the middle class has grown as never before. If the average life expectancy has gone up, ends up as even global inequality has been reduced. So anyway, what we hope is that the next 25 years are going to be even better and that we recognize that, that all political, cultural and social differences, but we shouldn't see them as a threat.
