Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          Here's the question. Everyone's been wondering for the past few days, what would happen if both North Korea and South Korea merged in z one single nation? Yes, I know this isn't something that's going to happen in the near future, but it certainly is a possibility and one that might actually happen sooner than we expect. Just one year ago, nobody would have predicted that. Now in the spring of 2018 Kim Jong UN would shake hands with the South Korean President Moon Gin. So what would a Korean reunification look like? The truth is that is historical precedent and for all of this, yes, my day view is of course I'm talking about German reunification. As you may remember, Germany, he used to be divided into two separate countries and eastern block with a socialist communist regime and the Western block with a capitalist system,

Speaker 2:          01:01          Berlin Wall came down and East Germany was absorbed by Westerman and since then the government has spent lots of money so that the eastern Germans could enjoy a similar lifestyle to the wealthier western Germans. Many experts consider this a success story. Some of them claimed that this could be a model for what the integration of North and South Korea might look like. I mean, think about it. In both cases, there's capitalism and socialism. In both cases. One side is Paul, while the other side as wealthy, and in both cases they share a common language, common history, and to come in.

Speaker 2:          01:35          But now the question is, what was the German reunification as successful as it looks on paper? Can we say East Germans today aren't doing as well as their western Nader's? Well, the answer is no. Even in soccer, we can see small differences. Since Germany was reunited, there've been no eastern teams in the Bundesliga since 2009 the western teams still dominate the national sport. In fact, there is only one east German team in the Buddhists Liga, the rb Leipzig, but it's just one team and a soccer league of over 18 teams. And the same applies in economics. But where the differences turn more scary is when we talk about politics. For example, in the last election, the radical rightwing afd has ended the parliament as the third largest party. This radical anti immigrants and euro skeptic party has gained the majority of its vote from regions in the former East Germany. This is mark the first time since 1961 that a far right party that says this kind of presence in German parliaments and that's a view is actually pretty frightening. Benj of the east. How anger in former GDR helped the afd. So the real question here is this is the process of reunification done. What can we learn from Germany if it could be applied to north and South Korea? Well, today we aren't going to answer this question, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history to the victors go the spoils often or it's unconditional surrender, the allies divided and to for military occupation zones, Britain in the northwest, France, in the southwest, the USA and the south and the Soviet Union in the east.

Speaker 2:          03:10          There's a lot more we could say about this time, but we're not going to go into every little detail because, well, if we did, you'd be staring at my face for a couple of hours. Yeah. But suffice it to say that from 1949 Germany was transformed into two different countries. West Germany officially known as the Federal Republic of Germany with on as its capital and East Germany whose official name was the Democratic Republic of Germany with its capital and East Berlin. East Germany was the communist region. Well, West Germany became the embodiment of its capitalists. Occupants. While West Berlin started to look more and more like a big city would in the United States, east Berlin became Moscow's carbon. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:45          Top.

Speaker 2:          03:48          According to East Germany's first constitution, its citizens enjoyed certain basic rights, even the rights to strike, but in reality it was a little freedom or policy related matters were decided by the Pellissippi Eric, the executive committee of the Socialist Unity Party. That's the main and almost only source of information in the country was directly financed by the only party. Here's a great example of just how unbiased it was.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Sure.

Speaker 2:          04:14          The Central Oregon of the Socialist Unity Party celebrating 100 years of the communist manifesto. East Germany's economy, as you may have already guessed, was it century plans and almost completely owned by the state, the central governments at the price of housing, basic goods and even services. So basically every year the government would publish a list with the mandatory prices of every basic good. You'd want to buy a bread roll, five marks, a thousand bucks for a Sony Walkman and so on and so forth. Even if you had the money, there were waiting lists in place for goods like cars and electronics. I mean, who really wants to wait 10 years to get a travel card? Take the unemployment generated by these strips, price control, take all of those empty supermarkets, take the scarcity of primary basic goods and pair those with aliments like a low birth rate and guess what? You guys, you got lots and lots of people who want to escape.

Speaker 1:          05:05          Jen,

Speaker 2:          05:10          what did the government do about this? Well, they built a wall to stop people leaving the country in order to justify this movie. The official state propaganda claims that they were building the walls. You protected their country from fascist infiltration. That the actual reason it was exactly,

Speaker 1:          05:24          yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:31          As you can imagine, what would having a literal wall between them, the relationship between east and West Germany wasn't exactly friendly. In fact, West Germany didn't even recognize the East German government because they claim to be the only legitimate state for all Janice and to the east did the same thing. Now this might actually remind you of something. Yes. It's more or less the relationship that the two careers have with each other. Although in the former case, there were no nuclear bombs involved and just like north and South Korea raw reaching an agreement, east and West Germany normalize their relations in the 1970s but the real twist in history that came in the year 1989 no one could have anticipated that the 40th anniversary of the GDR would also be, it's lost and that Germany would be reunited one small, but then history if found a way to surprise us all the speed at which these changes occurred with astounding only 10 months after the fall of the wall east and West Germany, we'd become a single nation. The new Germany has here, secretary of state, James A. Baker, the third set, let her legacy be that after 45 years we finally got the political arithmetic right. Two plus four adds up to one Germany in a Europe whole and free bus make no mistakes. This was not a merger between two countries. This was a complete absorption. Basically on October 3rd, 1990 East Germany disappeared as an independent country and became a part of West Germany as this was definitely a good move, but it did have some downsides

Speaker 2:          07:10          reunited at last. It's like the two states where one once more, but not everything was exactly sunshine and rainbows. Huh? Or West Germany was extremely wealthy and has high productivity and was very industrialized. East Germany was the opposite. The Soviet controlled state at a lower productivity, less wealth and eight totally different political system. Again, this was a very similar starting point. Does that have north and South Korea, although less extreme, but the process to be successful, the two states needed to somehow find a way to unify that two completely different structures. So now the question probably in your mind as well, what exactly did they do? Well, basically West Germany exported all of their laws, their taxes and their regulations to east German.

Speaker 2:          08:07          In exchange, they also took care of all the infrastructure costs. This means that the western taxpayers would pay for the highways, the railroads, and the streets of eastern Germany. And now I know what you're probably thinking right now. This sounds pretty fair, right? I mean, if you want to join your poorer neighbor to create a big country, you kind of have to help them recover. But economics is way more complicated than just pouring money into something. Basically, the reunification meant the total collapse of the whole eastern economy. And why was this? Well, just think about it. I mean, having a single country means having a single market to a single market where Western companies where several times more productive than that, eastern counterparts, so east in factories, they just couldn't compete. For example, East Germany produced the famous travel car. I mean, compared with a bmw or an Audi, a trevor is just a toy. So the demand for those cars, well it just dropped by for day.

Speaker 1:          09:01          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:01          Many refugees hoping to settle in the West, dump their communists, built vehicles near the West Germany embassy in Prague. Alright, so imagine the situation you work in a factory to the company. It has to close because nobody's buying their cars. Then you go to the supermarket and everything you wanted to buy is produced in the West because well they have the best factories. But then again, everything is more and more expensive because well surprise, all of a sudden you live in a rich country with really high crisis. This isn't the end of the story here. I mean imagine you're an old man in the east and you get a pension that's calculated based on the prices during communist times, but that was 1999 you go to the [inaudible] and the bread has a western price, which is terrific.

Speaker 1:          09:39          Cool.

Speaker 2:          09:43          You can probably see where I'm going with this young people, I mean at least they could emigrate and believe me they did, but what could the elderly do? And just hold on a second now because on top of all that we have the currency exchanges. Do you see the two countries, they're different currencies with different values. So how did they make it work while the finance ministers of eastern and western Jimmy, they met in a room and they decided on a fixed exchange rate between the West German mark and the East German market. The public demanded a one to one exchange and on July the first 1990 the banks in the former eastern Germany provided people with the unbelievable exchange rate of one to one. I say this isn't quite marks because the theory was one thing and the reality was quite another. Most of the banks would sell you one western mark for two eastern ones. This is an exchange rate of two to one and on the black market, that exchange rate would be anywhere from eight to one to 12 to one. So from one day to the next, all the money that you had in your savings, we'd lose half of its value.

Speaker 2:          10:45          So when I, you might be wondering, well, what did the German government do to manage the situation? Well, the answer is subsidies, subsidies, and our whole palm or subsidies, west German taxpayers paid medical bills, infrastructure, and they were doing everything they could to prevent eastern Germans from migrating. We're talking about almost 70 billion US dollars every single year since 1990 that is the equivalent of organizing for Olympic Games. Every single, yeah. Sorry. Now I know what you're wondering off to almost 30 years. Is this reunification process done? Can we say that Germany is now an equal country? Well, the viewer, the answer is yes and also no, but not mixed. According to one study, a good share of German state that they wouldn't marry somebody from the other Germany, three quarters of the German population thing. There are still different mentalities between the east and the West and 10% of east Germans have never once traveled to the other side, and of course there still differences

Speaker 1:          11:54          in economic terms. If you look at this chart, you can see that at the time of reunification, the GDP per capita in the east was 9,400 euros as compares to 22,000 euros in the West.

Speaker 2:          12:08          Today it's 27,000 euros and 41,000 years. Yes, the differences are more subtle, but nobody can seriously claim that there are no differences and of course we still have the cultural differences. A research study done by Jacob University in Bremen measured community spirit is considering a number of factors including trust in institutions and tolerance towards the Lgbtq community as well as ethnic minorities. All the regions, the ones made up east Germany appeared in the bottom half of the index

Speaker 2:          12:41          and finally we have the political differences that we can see in the latest elections. Eastern Germans voted for afd of far right wing party and d Linka of far left wing party while western Germans chose more moderate candidates. This divide in the polls shows house. Still to this day, eastern Germans are heavily influenced by Russian politics. This is important because one day eastern Germans could hijack German politics and destroy that sense of gem in moderation. Now going back to the case of North Korea, imagine what would happen if North Koreans kept voting for communist parties. I mean all of a sudden you have a leader like Kim Jong and making decisions that also affect South Koreans, which sounds pretty scary. Now of course there are many bright sides do the German reunification, and as we've mentioned in many of our videos here at visual politic, Germany is still a model for other countries. But as we always say, not everything is perfect and if there has to be a Korean reunification, one day it will not come without. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:37          Risks. But

Speaker 2:          13:42          now it's your turn. Do you think the eastern Germans could radicalize the political debates in Germany? Do you still feel the German reunification could be a model for the Korean Peninsula? Please leave your answer in the comment section below.
