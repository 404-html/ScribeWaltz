Speaker 1:          00:08          Many of you have asked for this video, and I'll be honest, we're not very surprised, the Republic of China better known as Taiwan has some of the most strange and controversial political and diplomatic situations in the entire world. So let me explain. At the time of publishing this video, Taiwan has only received formal recognition from 20 of the world's countries and some of these countries, well, they're pretty small, like the Vatican Tuvalu in Swaziland fight all of this. Taiwan has managed to become one of the richest and freest countries on the planet. It has a well equipped army and it is one of these spear heads over the United States in Southeast Asia. Before we really get into it, let's take a look back and see where it began. The great Chinese separation, the situation Taiwan finds itself in has its origin in the Chinese civil war, which took place between 1927 and 1949 war between the conservative forces. The Chinese Nationalist Party led by Chiang Kai Shek and the forces of the Communist Party of Nazi Tome on December the 10th, 1949. The last setting, Chengdu fell into the hands of the nationalists. The war had ended and the communists and gotten their way shortly before Chang do fell that they, in carrying the nationalist leader Chiang Kai Shek, left bound for Taiwan. The last province under national list control z didn't go alone.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Check 2 million more people, took shelter in Taiwan along with the survivors of the nationalist army. Since then ends, even though mal tried to take the islands back, Taiwan has received support from the United States. The US continued recognizing the governments over the island as the legitimate government of China up until 1979. As a curious note here, Taiwan is the only country other than the US that is continually operated the youtube spy plane. Their mission was to monitor Mao's China. The CIA itself was actually in charge of conducting these operations.

Speaker 2:          02:11          Nope. About

Speaker 1:          02:11          1979. It's a really important date. At this time, the United States was trying to build trust with Beijing. This was in order to create some sort of a double envelopment against the Soviet Union. We actually talked about this in a previous video and I'll leave a link to that in the description. Well, the thing is, in 1979, the presidents of the United States, Jimmy Carter, decided to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing and mass meant that they had to stop recognizing the government of the Republic of China. That is the government based in Taipei. You see Taiwan that never declared its independence for years. The government based in Taipei, captain, considering itself as the legitimate government of all of China as of course the country. You can only have diplomatically speaking one government and yes, this is how the one China started and today this is supported by Washington Adams. Most countries around the world. This is a change by the way, the course Taiwan to lose its place in the UN as well as other important international organizations, but it is true that the United States, we're still committed to the security of Taiwan. That same year, in 1979, the American Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act. This was documents that among other things, reserve the option for the US to ensure the security and defense of the islands and since that act was passed for us when it's done, just that,

Speaker 1:          03:45          but as I was saying at the beginning of this video, none of these things have kept Taiwan from being the star of one of the greatest stories of the economic and social success, big roar of the tiger,

Speaker 1:          04:00          fifties, Taiwan. It was a very poor place that had a pretty rudimentary economy where their exports were basically really basic things like rice and sugar. So the question at that time was, how are we going to develop such a port islands while the Taiwanese government thought the best way to achieve success was to ensure that businesses on the island could sell their products all over the world? This was considered to be the best way to open up the island to the world and even encouraged savings. Yeah. Am I seeing counter intuitive, but actually this action does encourage people to save because in order to invest, you first need to get the resources that are necessary to do so and well. That's exactly what they did. The governments of the islands soon started to eliminate almost all import restrictions. This meant the businesses could get all the products they required to set up their businesses and assembly lines without being stung by import fees. This is sort of similar to what it's this culture of saving attitude, the legal certainty of the country and so encouraged further investments world. Soon enough, Taiwanese companies began appearing like mushrooms after the rain, as they exploded all kinds of products. The rest of them,

Speaker 1:          05:13          tad industrial products, we're already 90 percent of the country's exports and they were growing an average of 30 percent per year.

Speaker 2:          05:19          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:21          they sold all kinds of things to the world, toys, radios, bike, socks, just about everything. And of course, as you can imagine with that sort of situation that the per capita income didn't stop growing in just 30 years. It multiplied by F

Speaker 2:          05:35          fine

Speaker 1:          05:40          with that. A new Asian tiger was born.

Speaker 2:          05:46          Now

Speaker 1:          05:46          don't a anything that this was an easy process. I mean, Taiwan didn't even have a democracy until the 19 nineties, but once they've got their freedom, the Taiwanese people, they held onto it tightly. Let's have a look at some example. Is Today considered the 11 freest economy in the world in Asia? Only Hong Kong and Singapore rank best that it's a rich country with quite a high standard of living and it is one of the countries that has a significant number of civil liberties and in fact Taiwan, they're about to make history.

Speaker 2:          06:19          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          06:19          Taiwan court rules in favor of same sex marriage in historic first for an Asian country

Speaker 1:          06:31          who as you can see compared with continental China, well, there really is no comparison in terms of per capita income. The Taiwanese onto day three times richer than the Chinese. They are much more free, but in spite of all of this good stuff, there are still some clouds on the horizon,

Speaker 3:          06:51          clouds in the Taiwanese sky.

Speaker 1:          06:55          The truth is this, in the last few years, the country has been going through a few things. Salaries have been frozen for years and didn't see thousand and 15. The country went through a small recessions since then. Economic growth, well, it's been very slow and now be rather obvious. Question is what exactly is happening? Well, there are several ingredients to this rather bitter recipe, which is threatening the future.

Speaker 2:          07:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:21          This is competition from new emerging markets like China, Indonesia, Vietnam, also the brain drain and the aging population and the cliffs to broken pension system. The latter of the pension system is the problem vertebra by far concerns the government of the most. Look for years, the pensions of public workers. They were inflated for political reasons. They did this in order to get votes. Adams well, it became really, really expensive. Public pensions whipped so inflated that they are now threatening the stability of the entire system. Taiwanese

Speaker 3:          07:52          workers earn about 1300 US dollars per month on average, but retired high school teachers receive a whopping average pension of 2,250 US dollars per month.

Speaker 1:          08:04          As you well know, bad policies turnouts to be expensive. Let's consider some of the other problems to continue our. For the next ingredients in our bitter recipe would be what is called the 40 40 issue. It's like the Taiwanese economy. It's very dependent on the electronic industry as well as commerce in China,

Speaker 2:          08:23          no

Speaker 3:          08:27          goods or 40 percent of all of their export, and China is the destination of almost 40 percent of Taiwan's export,

Speaker 1:          08:39          so now you might be wondering, well, what exactly is the problem with that? Well, this dependence on electronics and China means that when the electronics industry or China isn't doing well, economically, Taiwan suffers too, and that's precisely what has happened over the last few years, but wait, because we're not done yet. Above all, that is a political problem which has affected the country severely and has caused for an investment in Taiwan to be significantly lower than that of the countries nearby and so well, what's the problem that? Well, foreign investors are afraid of China. The Chinese threat. This is by far the biggest problem that Taiwan is facing. Humans of Beijing is determining to regain sovereignty over the islands and it's made a public declaration on the data that states two things. First of all, it will happen before 20, 49, the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, and secondly that they are willing to use force if Taiwan tries to declare its independence. So let me dig into that. A little Taiwan could be considered an independent country from pretty much every perspective. The island has its own presidents whose democratically elected by the way, it has its own laws. It has its own army. However, Beijing isn't going to accept formal independence the most they are willing to give. Taiwan temporarily is a status similar to that of Hong Kong, and this is pretty serious because among other things, most Taiwanese don't feel that their identity is paint.

Speaker 2:          10:11          No

Speaker 1:          10:15          citizens of a free country, which has been independent for almost 70 years. In fact, in 2014 when the previous government solve Taiwan tried to approach Beijing to develop a trade agreements, but Taiwanese people started a revolution which eventually became known as the sunflower revolution. Hundreds of young people protested with the motto. Taiwan is not.

Speaker 2:          10:36          Sale

Speaker 1:          10:41          was exactly under this atmosphere of economic and political frustration that in 2016, the Democratic Progressive Policy, a party whose foundations were mainly pro independence, one that the legislative and presidential election citing wing, not the closest politician to Beijing that became the first female presidents of Tyler

Speaker 2:          11:02          one,

Speaker 1:          11:04          even though the economy was the most crucial factor, Beijing didn't like this election at all. They disapproved of it so much that they decided to start harassing Taiwan again in 2017 and up to now, Chinese tourism to Taiwan has been reduced by 40 percent. Beijing has convinced to countries, Panama and Sao Tome and Principe to stop recognizing Taiwan and it is blocking the presence of the island in many international forums. For now, there has been no economic retaliation, but the island knew that they could be in for a Sivia below. This is why one of the priorities of the new government is to open up to as many new markets as possible as soon as possible. So now you might be wondering where is the US and all of this. I mean, this is a visual politic video. After all, and we've been a little light on the US so far, so where are they?

Speaker 1:          11:50          Well, for now, their support seems to remain in tact. In fact, trump's administration is already approved. A weapon sale to Taiwan went off at one point $5,000,000,000. Trump administration approves first arms sale to Taiwan, and on top of all that, the powerful Senate Arms Services Committee in the United States and navy ships to use Taiwanese ports, and they did so with a majority of votes from both the democratic and the Republican parties in both chambers finally approved that decision. You can bet to the Beijing, they're going to be pretty annoyed. Oh, what is Washington's objective yet? Well, that would be to try and prevent Beijing from even thinking about a military invasion of Taiwan and that's pretty much it for now. Here are visual. Politic wiggins. Keep a close eye on Taiwan as the situation develops, but now it's your turn. What do you think the future of Taiwan will hold?
