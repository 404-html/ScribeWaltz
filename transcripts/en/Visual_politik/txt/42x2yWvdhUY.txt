Speaker 1:          00:09          Many of you may have experienced doubts about certain future technological advancements. I mean don't deny it's a fear of technology, of artificial intelligence, of autonomous cars or factories with our work as a smart robots, it's totally fine if I think of odd jobs being taken away. If a few gaining power at the expense of others, inequalities multiplying, it's even machines controlling us and taking over the world. It's scary stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:31          Well, but I'm an adult. I always pickwick, no enemy and this boy my arm.

Speaker 1:          00:42          It's like kind of machines really replace human beings. Could they really manage to teach themselves and take control of civilization? What role are people going to play in a world of intelligent machines folks, this fear of change of the unknown of the future. Has it become something like our own 21st century Phantom, a fanzine that is now moving all around the planet. Although you know what? Truthfully, this is nothing new. The relationship between human beings and machines, it's never been simple. It is always awakened. Mixed Feeling,

Speaker 3:          01:25          oh go has landed cause that the same noise you heard when you signed your sportswear contract.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Fair them. Then there's others. Even as an opportunity for progress, there are those who view them with distrust and those who view them as great allies, and of course there are always those who predicted that because of all these machines, the end of humanity is getting nearer. By the way, before we can send you, what group do you belong to, you let me know in the comments below and also we've got a survey about it at the end of the video. So check that out. And of course along with all these fairs are the typical contradictions that always arise just because the machines take our jobs and at the same time we complain about the mundane and exhausting jobs to which many employees are subjected, especially the least qualified ones or for example, another very typical contradiction. Almost every day we hear union leaders demanding a shorter work day while at the same time rejecting or wanting to hold technology, which you know would actually lead to that shorter work. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:22          Then

Speaker 1:          02:23          there's one of my favorites. Many politicians continually denounce workers, low purchasing power while they place obstacles and even pro habits technologies that increased productivity and lower prices. Maybe you've thought about the taxi sector runs platforms like Uber. We at visual politics certainly half of course to view it in the end, adapting to new changes. It tends to be just a matter of time. Do you know a single person who worries about jobs that have disappeared because of mobile phones? Do you know anyone who wants to ban electric power because it can hard to candle factory workers, but it's true. As we mentioned before, the arrival of artificial intelligence has led to some questions and some new challenges, but before we talk all about that, let's look back at the history.

Speaker 4:          03:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Fear of change.

Speaker 4:          03:14          Sure.

Speaker 1:          03:16          The political speeches we hear everyday, they pose nothing new and the lungs raised about technological changes. They come directly from such speeches. Seek from the very beginning, from the time human beings lived in caves, humanity has progressed thanks to the use of tools together to cultivate. Do you conserve food, ought to improve productivity. It's all because of tools. Tools have given us the chance to achieve better lives. In fact, nowadays, community is experiencing the greatest welfare and all of its history.

Speaker 4:          03:47          Sure.

Speaker 1:          03:49          However, during a particular moment in history, tools and machines became something like an enemy to be beaten, at least for a certain part of society. We're of course talking about the time of the industrial revolution. This is despite the fact that the industrial revolution meant a huge leap in terms of welfare for billions of, yeah, does that at the time, machines began to be used widely. Protests against them multiplied and its movements of all kinds emerged against the use of new technologies. The basic argument was that so many machines would leave artisans, workers and peasants out of what.

Speaker 4:          04:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:26          Famous of these reactions was that of the Luddites who you were at the beginning of the 19th century, promoted attacks against factories and especially against machines. They hated them with all their might and of course had to destroy them because a world with machines would be terrible. Between you and me, let's just say that, thank goodness they didn't get their way. I mean, can you really imagine what life would be like? But before we continue, here's a question. What do you think about trains? Do you like them? Do you think they useful or maybe you consider them dangerous? The channels is, are you probably think that they're worth having around. While the eighth president of the United States, President Martin van Buren, he wouldn't agree with you as Michael Cox and Richard Alm tell us in that book, myths of the rich and poor, why we're better off than we think. In 1829 Martin van Buren, who was very concerned about the dangers of the railroad, he was so concerned that he even wrote to the president, Andrew Jackson, to asking to push a railroad ban. Yep. You heard that, right? Martin van Buren thought that the railroad would risk the jobs of thousands of people who worked in deliveries and in canals and boat construction. In fact, since Van Buren also thought that it ships were essential to defend the United States, so you considered the railroad to be a serious threat to national scale.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Not all in that same letter addressed to President Andrew Jackson. Van Buren also warns about the danger of a transportation system that moved a whopping 24 kilometers per hour.

Speaker 4:          05:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Yes. These arguments, they do seem a bit ridiculous nowadays, but at the time, many people took these ideas very seriously and it's okay. It's true. Technological changes have caused difficulties throughout history. Think for example, about what happens with the development of telecommunications. See Wenzel often. He became massive in its early days. When you wanted to talk to someone, you gave an operator the name and surname of the person you wanted to talk to.

Speaker 4:          06:26          Rehab. Would you call it the charges on this for me, please? One moment please.

Speaker 1:          06:36          The second half of the 20th century, which really wasn't so long ago, tens of thousands of operators worked connecting long distance calls. There's of course, made the calls very, yeah,

Speaker 4:          06:45          stock tag, the world's smallest slightest cellular phone. I can see the battery, one of the phone or anywhere like this, man, how are you?

Speaker 1:          06:55          By 1980 technology allowed communications to be made directly without any intermediaries other than need. The operators became irrelevant in the calls became very, very cheap.

Speaker 1:          07:05          So the question is what happened to all of the operators? Well, they had to find new jobs and yes, I know adapting isn't always easy, but evidently this change until often it was very beneficial for society as a whole. Communications, it became easier and much cheaper. That's why the important thing is to generate lots of employment opportunities within a society and to make it relatively easy to change jobs. Can you just imagine if a state, if a government had forbidden these positions from disappearing, that country's communications would still be very slow. People would sometimes have to wait hours to speak with someone and cools would be very expensive. All of this would have made the economy and the total number of jobs in that country. Not very good because folks, we tend to forget one thing now as you watch this video, your going through the time in history where technology is used them. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          07:53          See,

Speaker 1:          07:56          you know what? It's also the time where people worked the most. In fact, it's curious, but the countries that use the most robots are precisely those that suffer the least unemployment, which is definitely not a bad thing. Now, some of you might be thinking, come on Simon, artificial intelligence, that's going to be different. Well, let's dive into that.

Speaker 5:          08:14          Are you listening? I'm of a, I,

Speaker 4:          08:25          Debbie. Have you,

Speaker 1:          08:25          uh, the time of artificial intelligence and robots, it's already here. Everyday we use more products and more services that function with artificial intelligence from voice assistants do the autonomous cars that are already beginning to circulate. And yes, the speed with which this intelligence progresses is certainly impressive. We could say that artificial intelligence involves applying the enormous power of computers to solve problems. Well, in the last 30 years, the cost of computing capacity, it became 200 times cheaper. To give you an idea of what this means, we could say that if the car industry's cost to devolved in the same way today, high ends car would cost only for 10 thousandths of what it does. Now, this would make it cheaper than a single Venezuelan boulevard. And yes, they've all of our under Nicolas Maduro, we won't eat those. This evolution is precisely what explains why today a playstation four costs less than $400 even if it is about 2000 times more powerful than the Cray to supercomputer. One of the most famous computers in history, which beat all records back in 1984 and this computer, unlike the playstation four weighed two and a half tons and cost $18 million. Today a playstation four can perform 1.8 4 trillion floating point operations per second. This would take a person approximately 60,000 years to do and it's precisely this enormous calculation capacity that allows ais to replace us in several tasks.

Speaker 1:          09:58          For example, sooner or later the autonomous car will end up imposing itself. We simply wouldn't be able to compete with its calculation abilities, especially now that these machines have managed to perceive their environment thanks to cameras, microphones and sensors. So yes, based on how things are evolving, it seems almost certain that in a relatively short time, many mechanical and routine jobs from factories to the field will be carried out by smart machines.

Speaker 1:          10:25          It means the productivity will increase the lawsons with us. That also means most people's well being will also increase. I think the next 30 years people will only work four hours a day and maybe four days a week. My grandfather worked 16 hours a day and the farmland and he thought he was very busy. We work eight hours five days a week and we think we are very busy. Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba and no Dallas. During this time, many new jobs will be created of all kinds because you see, the question we may want to ask ourselves is how close are the machines to surpassing us? Well, for some tasks that really close, but for many, not really. You see, machines can compete very quickly, but they have problems learning. Computers are very inefficient learners. They only recognize patterns after analyzing something. An overwhelming number of times since this is humanity's great advantage, the most advanced machine learning systems require thousands of examples to acquire new concepts. While humans can generalize from a few examples. Many animals can learn from a limited number of experiences, but humans seem particularly good at generalizing based on just a few experiences. Greg Corrado, Stanford neuroscientist and director of augmented intelligence at Google. This explains why nowadays humans are far superior in areas such as creativity, innovation, intuition, and empathy. Folks, nobody can predict the future, but until now, machines have always meant more jobs and better welfare for all

Speaker 1:          11:58          in the near future. It's almost certain that what is already happening will continue to happen. Some jobs will be destroyed and many others will be created and also need highly qualified ones, but jobs of all kinds, and it's probably working hours will decrease and to real wages will increase. Beyond that. It's very hard to predict what may or may not happen, but let's not fall into the same mistakes that former US president Martin van Buren fell in Duke during his fear and rejection of the railroad. There are still many challenges to overcome in the world such as poverty and environmental sustainability and the machines. They can really help us a lot.
