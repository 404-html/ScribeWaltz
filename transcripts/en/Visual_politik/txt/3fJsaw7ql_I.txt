Speaker 1:          00:08          In the last few years, Chile has become the Christiana Renaldo last in America. It was the country with the highest growth, had the most success and sticking with our metaphor here, it scored the most goals also for many classical liberals, Chile has been the benchmark for years we can say they considered the Chilean models something of a dream in a world full of dark nightmares,

Speaker 1:          00:34          and it was true. There were good reasons for celebration Chile, which ones was the poorest Spanish country in Latin America became the richest in the region. It became the country with the highest life expectancy in the country with the best social services in the entire region. It is true that inequality is very high in Chile, but the entire population of Chile has benefited from the prosperity that the country has achieved over the past few decades. For the past 25 years, the income of the poorest people in the country has increased far more than the income of the wealthiest people as their purchasing power has grown six times larger. All of this compares very favorably to other Latin American nations. As an example, in 1950, the average income was around a third of Venezuelan income in a manner of speaking and Venezuelans were three times richer. A lot has changed since then and today. Chileans are much richer than Venezuelans. They also have a longer life expectancy, hla and lives in average of eight years, more than a person born in Venezuela.

Speaker 2:          01:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Comparing Chile to Venezuela or Argentina shore makes Chilean look good, but when the comparison is made with other more distant countries, for example, those in Asia, the figures aren't nearly so nice and further. It seems as if the country has stopped growing, which is certainly well,

Speaker 2:          01:52          yes,

Speaker 3:          01:57          the Chilean slow down

Speaker 1:          02:01          last few years. The optimism and success, well, it's come to an end in San Diego, the capital of the country, the displays of wealth and prosperity of left making room instead for demonstrations and protests, anger and despair have taken over and well, it's only logical economic growth has fallen for the last few years and in 2016, unemployment increased while salaries remains frozen. Further, the youth can't find jobs in both investment and exports have fallen and the thing is that things aren't looking like they're going to get any better anytime soon.

Speaker 3:          02:36          Twenty 16, the Chilean economy grew by one point, five percent. Truly central banks forecast for 2017 are not a whole lot better. Increasing to two percent from one percent.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Just want me to all of the growth of the last decades. Three out of every four Chileans make less than $700 a month, so now you can probably understand their anger. These aren't the salaries that belonged to a rich country, so all in all, the Chilean model seems to be failing and there is one person who is responsible for this slow down. And that's Miquel Baca. That's the current president of Chile.

Speaker 3:          03:11          Evolution of Bachelot Michelle

Speaker 1:          03:15          backlash was the president of Chile for March, 2016, March 2010, but essentially a president can be elected to two consecutive terms, so bankers have to wait four years before she could run again for Lamanita the name of the presidential palace in Chile. Well, after gaining the support of almost all the left wing parties, including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, won the elections in November of 2013 and a few months later, I'd been march of 2014, she became the president of the Republic of Chile again

Speaker 1:          03:47          in the second time back, let decided to go through with reforms which were much more aggressive than the ones she came up with at the time around. Her first decision was to increase taxation on companies by almost 40 percent. Quite a dramatic move. He did it by raising rates on profits and also by eliminating a bonus, which means companies could reduce taxation if the profits were reinvested in Chile. Think about it. That was all about reinvestment, was actually a really reasonable incentive. A country like China, which is far from being rich, needs factories, machines, businesses, technology and investments, and this incentive encouraged the growth of all of these things. So the question is, what's the point of publishing companies providing this much needed investments? And in addition to all of this taxation on companies wasn't exactly low. To begin with, take a look at how things are now off tobacco that has punished these companies.

Speaker 3:          04:38          Chile has the second highest corporate taxes in the world surpassed only by Japan, a much richer country with much larger companies,

Speaker 1:          04:47          and would you like to know the consequences of this measure? Well, investment has fallen by 30 percent since backer lead came back to the presidential palace and of course, less investment means ness job's less growth and therefore less tax revenue. In other words, they decided to eat the cake before they could even bake us and weld. That rarely works. That is why there has been a clear international tendency to reduce taxation on companies over the last few years.

Speaker 3:          05:15          Canada, the UK and Ireland are some examples of countries where corporate taxes has been reduced. The new president of France, Emmanuel Macron, has also promised to reduce taxes

Speaker 1:          05:27          well, surely. Well, it's headed in the opposite direction, but do wait a second here because well, that's not the other two main reforms. Bachelors is put through. You have resulted in a very similar outcome. Labor reform as made recruitment more expensive and has given more power to trade unions. Some, I liked the sounds of this, but it means more costs for companies which when added to the increase on taxation means there is even less investments, less competition and less exports. Essentially. All of this has caused, well the whole lot of problems. On the other hand, tobacco ads tried to pass an ambitious reform. Do you turn the private college education system into a public free of charge service? The problem is the visual politic view of that. This model is very expensive and some say the solution to the problems of education is to improve the quality of the universities themselves instead of making them into factories, printing deployments. But anyway, the thing is back in that couldn't pass this reform and in her attempt to do so, she turns the whole education system upside down. For example, she has reduced the amount of investment that was plans to improve the quality of these universities, but okay, well now you might be wondering, well, what are the citizens of Chile? Think about all of this. Well, that's look closely.

Speaker 3:          06:36          Percent of Chileans believe that Michelle Bachelet government must delay or at least moderate some of the reforms that have recently taken place in the country, especially educational reform.

Speaker 1:          06:48          It feels as if I was working towards an ideological change rather than a formula which could actually sold national problems. In fact, all these reforms and the hostility towards private corporations have led to Chile to suffer the worst economic period for decades as well. Do you know who is most negatively affected by the situation? Well, that's the poor and the working class after all the wealthy already have a good standard of living.

Speaker 2:          07:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:18          The thing is, backlit leaves the country with a crisis with the growing public deficit, with the highest public spending of the last 26 years, and frankly with the damage to economy. But now that you know all of this, you might be wondering, well, besides backlash, one of the biggest weaknesses in Chile. Well, let's have a look.

Speaker 3:          07:40          Chili's. Weaknesses,

Speaker 2:          07:41          yes.

Speaker 1:          07:44          The shelly doesn't like foreign professionals. It's a bit strange for a country like Chile because they seem to have been incapable of attracting foreign professionals. Immigration is only two percent, and while that's a problem, because it affects entrepreneurship, innovation and trait,

Speaker 3:          07:59          why won't Chili grow? Because it is full of Chileans. Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Center for International Development of Harvard University.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Generally speaking, foreign professionals tend to be more entrepreneurial, which helps the economy too diverse.

Speaker 3:          08:15          In Chile, the rate of entrepreneurship among immigrants is four times higher than that among native Chileans.

Speaker 1:          08:22          The second problem is that the so called social data is not working. That is deceived. There are new changes in the social classes. If you're born boy, you die poor. If you're born rich, you'd die rich. In fact, the country is really controlled by seven families whose wealth is equivalent to 17 percent of the national GDP. This might seem unimportant, but when the social ladder in competition don't work, it means the family name is more important than talent and effort. The opportunity costs for the country is huge and these families usually have quite special relationships with power. Consider this

Speaker 4:          08:57          bachelet son was charged with corruption and Ronica look, which one of the most powerful men in Chile and the owner of the Bank of Chile was also involved in the scandal.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Yup. Even the back of that name has been spoiled with corruption. Then there's the bureaucracy. I'm sure you've heard that Chile is a very free economy. Well, when you take a closer look, you can see it's also very bureaucratic. It has all kinds of regulations. For instance, Chiney can't import secondhand cars and foreign workers don't have access to a bank accounts so well. It certainly seems as if it could be more free. Mark Twain said that all three kinds of lies, lies, Damn lies and statistics. The thing is initially, well they probably have some of that

Speaker 1:          09:39          selections in the country will take place on the 19th of November, 2017, and one thing is for sure if Jenny wants to go back to the good times, they must change direction. It's like, well, that's our opinion here, official policy Polish. Now. We'd love to know what you think. What is your opinion of backlash? What do you think of the Chilean model?
