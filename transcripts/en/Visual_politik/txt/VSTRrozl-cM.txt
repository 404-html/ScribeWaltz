Speaker 1:          00:07          Amazing is the only rock dance with their own private jets. And do you know who the pilot of that pilot jet might be? Well, yes. That's none other than the lead singer Bruce Dickenson. And listen, there are not many people who deserve more admiration than Mr Dickinson. If it wasn't enough to be one of the most successful heavy metal singers in history, he's also an experienced commercial pilot, a radio host, a writer, an ownership into. I'm the CEO of one of the most innovative aviation companies in the wells. As you know. Might be wondering, well, why are we talking about Bruce Dickinson on visual politic? I mean, what does iron maiden have to do with politics at all? Well, let me

Speaker 2:          00:41          tell you,

Speaker 1:          00:43          maiden singer Bruce Dickinson's, Cardiff aviation signs on to manage national carrier for Djibouti Palsy. If Aviation is a company that provides maintenance to airline companies, we could say that iron maiden has landed in Djibouti, but in this case they didn't come to perform. They came to sell airplanes, train the pilots and design a system so the Djibouti can have its own airlines. But just wait a minute because this is the really important thing here. You might think that the airlines have a country like judy owns a big deal, right? I mean, we're talking about a really poor country located in the Horn of Africa with a population of less than a million inhabitants.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Oh, I thought, what if I told you the debussy has a big chance of becoming the next Dubai. What if Bruce Dickinson is actually one of the first vision reason to decide to invest in this country? Think about it while you look at this map. Here it is true, but now this is the Suez Canal and this is the Red Sea. Any oil tanker who wants to go from Abu Dhabi to Europe must pass through here. All of those Chinese mobile phones sold in the UK, travel through this area. We don't have 10 ships that sail the planet are passing in front of the Djiboutian coasts. But make no mistake, this is not a quiet region. In fact, the opposite is true. Remember the Somali pirates? Well, this is Somalia and this other thing is called [inaudible] and it's not a chill place either and this other thing you see on the map, this is called Yemen and it's in the middle of a civil war. It turns out your booties, the only peaceful country in the entire room.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Now, hold on a minute once again because they still more here. Now, if you've been following this channel for a long time, you should already know, but Ethiopia is one of the fastest growing countries on the planet. They are becoming a textile superpower and they have more than 90 million inhabitants. And guess what else? Ethiopia has got no coast. This means whenever they want to sell their tax dollars, they have to do so through the Djibouti port and yes, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. Are we really talking about a new Singapore or Dubai or is the something missing here? I mean maybe you might be thinking now what should I be like Bruce Dickinson and invest in? Well, today we are going to answer all of those questions, but before do as always, let's take a look back at the history, location, location, location. I'll do everything I just said about, but some of you might be thinking right now. I mean, why have I never heard of this country before? Well, the answer to that lies in their history, which is not really very different from that.

Speaker 2:          03:19          Yes,

Speaker 1:          03:23          in the year 1977, after a peaceful referendum, Djibouti became the latest country to gain independence from their French colonizers and just as it happens in similar cases too, but he became a one party dictate until the 19 nineties, Mr Hassan Goulet apted on and other members of his tribe controlled the fate of this country. Sponsoring members of the opposition became a common practice and the ruling party got really, really rich off the profits from the port. Now you could say that back then, GBC was a textbook example of a gate keeper state. You see in such poor countries, the whole economy is dependent on just one thing. In the case of editorial Guinea for instance, that thing is oil. In the case of Jersey, well that would be it's port.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Since the dictators have no money to pay a big army to control the whole country, they must focus all of their oppressive powers in the area where the money is located, so Djibouti port was completely secured while the rest of the country was in total chaos. There were murders on the streets that was rape. There were all kinds of other horrific crimes. Now, as you can probably imagine, this is not the ideal situation to create companies or to track any sort of foreign investments now that in fact that in the nineties as civil war started between the governments and the opposition parties and tribes and it's all not exactly a recipe for success

Speaker 1:          04:57          as well. This is where the first difference between Djibouti and the rest of their neighbor countries comes in. The way the government's solved their problem was surprising to everybody. Basically, after years of bloody fighting and thousands of killings on both sides of the battle, Mr went to the other party, the so called fronts for the restoration of unity and democracy and essentially said to them, they're dudes. Okay, get a grip. There is money for everyone here. Why can't we share it all and just stop fighting each other and this. This is how to. But you got its first unity government, a government that combines most of the local political party.

Speaker 2:          05:34          Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:37          Now there is still political opposition in Djibouti though, but they can really not even meet campaigns and navy signed that on presidential elections. They are essentially causes. This explains why Amazon ads laser has his nephew the late when the elections with outcomes close to 100 percent of the vote. So yes, it's not exactly a leaving democracy bus. This is just the beginning. Despite the internal fights by the year 2011, but it was still a very corrupt country with a very weak position. I mean, think about it. We're talking about a really small country, less than 1 million inhabitants placed in the middle of one of the most violent regions on the planet. I mean Somalia, which is virtually anarchy where different tribes that constantly at each other's throat span. Then on the other side, we have Eritrea a dictatorship that makes North Korea looked like Sweden and in the south of course this Ethiopia, the biggest regional power and one who had any moments would be happy to invade your booty so they can have a coastline. So in summary, they were far from being in a peaceful situation, but then when everything seemed to be against them, history decided to give the country a marvelous break.

Speaker 3:          06:51          Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them,

Speaker 1:          06:58          all of a sudden America with George W dot Bush as their president declared war on terrorism and this meant sending troops to all the areas where our cells, what presence, which includes of course with a Horn of Africa and is there any better place for building military basis than shebooty. It has a peerless location and to governments that corrupt as it is, congratulates itself for being stable and having no ties with terrorist groups. Now, do you remember when I told you that the Red Sea is extremely dangerous for merchant ships? You know all the pirates and stuff? Well, from the camp lemon airbase, American troops can chase those Somali pirates and not only the Americans can do this in 10 years. The list of countries who have installed military bases in Djibouti, it's pretty much never ending. We can indeed find French, Italian and Spanish troops that indeed the only place where Japan has a military base abroad is turbidity and as you might be able to imagine with so many wells powers having a military presence here, China, well, this is where China comes into the picture.

Speaker 3:          08:01          Job

Speaker 1:          08:03          Opens first overseas base in Djibouti, ends. Of course, in such a poor in small country, having so many foreign armies is a fantastic deal. I mean, think about it. All of these soldiers, they need food to eat, they have to shop, and they also need to have some fun. This means lots of jobs, lots of money for the entire country and on top of all that, it's always the biggest problem Djibouti had for investments

Speaker 3:          08:29          with

Speaker 1:          08:29          so many military bases in the country, only an insane best and would dare to invade them. In fact, there are few places in Africa that are safer than shebooty nowadays, add to this, the perfect situation for international trade routes, and you can easily understand why this country has been growing at a five percent annual rate since the day American troops, but that boots on the ground, as you might've guessed. No, not everything is perfectly wonderful. Hip spiked this growth. Djibouti still has an unemployment rate higher than 50 percent. Yep. You heard that right? One out of two Djibouti eons. No stable job. In other words, these are lines that Bruce Dickinson helps creative just sending soldiers and people from ngos that traveled to places like Somalia or Ethiopia. That's just wait a minute here because the times they're certainly changing in this country, man and his vision. Remember this name? Alias Mosa Dowell a. Now you might be thinking, well, he's the new president rice. Well, no, certainly not to, but has kept the same president for the past 20 years. This man, well, he's the minister of Economy and finance, but in this case, the finance minister is even more famous than the president.

Speaker 1:          09:46          We needed to plan over a longer period. We accept that we will probably not be able to achieve all of our objectives during the current administration. The Vision Twenty, 35 clearly sets out the aspirations of the president and his government. Les. Yes, Musar Darwalla. Now, if you've been following visual politic for awhile, this vision 20 slash 35 thing will probably remind you of something. Do you remember this video where I told you about Rwanda's road out of poverty? This vision 20, 35 is a carbon copy of Rwanda's plants. In many aspects, the gbt governments wants their ports to have state of the art technology just like those of Singapore and Dubai for this while they need money, but not only that, Aa also knows there's. In order to make the economy work, you need to diversify as if a country only relies on one single industry. A small crisis could easily be the country's downfold. That again, if you want to diversify your economy, you still need money and you need a business friendly environments and corruption and lack of rule of law up seldom. Friends have businesses, kinds of foreign investments, and in these areas, Djibouti, while they get a gold medal, for example, despite the poor being the main economic driver in this country, nobody can see the accounting books. This means many governments officials are getting rich or without anyone knowing.

Speaker 1:          11:05          If this was not enough, part of the local legislation is based on sharia law. Nobody can even protest this fact because Djibouti is among the 10 countries with the lowest freedom of speech in the entire world. In just 2016, the government sent three BBC journalists to jail because they wanted to talk about election fraud. Now, as you can imagine, this is certainly hurting the country's opportunities and what's worse? Well, it's almost impossible to change the system. At the end of the day. The ruling class is already making enough money from the port and the rents. They guess from all of those foreign army

Speaker 2:          11:42          feather.

Speaker 1:          11:42          They also have enough security that makes them not afraid of a popular uprising. In other words, if Dalloway the finance minister, wanted to change the political system, and as he says in his vision 20, 35 paper and prove the governance over the country, he has an impossible job, right? Well, dear viewer, well sometimes miracles, they do happen.

Speaker 1:          12:03          Jody breaks ground on massive Chinese backed free trade zone. In other words, if you've gone, Shane's the whole political system in the entire country, just change a little part of it. In this special economic zone, everyone can buy property and build without having to wait months and months to get government permission. This makes it harder for governments. Officials who wants to take bribes. Now, on the other hand is all of the regulations are going to follow Chinese law. Essentially. This is a little short of a tiny little shenzen in the middle of a country. The agreement calls for the zone to handle $7,000,000,000 worth of trade, or within two years, Judi will create a unified customer system with trainer establish a trade center and set up a currency clearance. Well, what can we expect now? Well, the idea of making special economic zones is certainly nothing new and it's been proven to work many times. In fact, this is the system that let Dubai become the metropolis that it is today. The idea is that when you have a special economic zone, both the citizens and the political leads can see firsthand what happens when you have transparent laws and a good framework for companies to follow.

Speaker 1:          13:19          If this experiment works, politicians will be more willing to implement real changes in the rest of the country. All right, so in summary, we have an African country where security is granted by foreign armies and he was starting to apply serious reforms. We have a country with the perfect location in science to become a financial and logistical sensor in one of the busiest areas on the planets. So it seems that Mr Dickinson has found a virgin paradise for investments. Doesn't it? Well, hold on just a second because this does not enjoy. Beauty is going to become a freedom and human rights haven. I mean at the end of the day, neither China nor does by. Oh really? Such havens either. But this can be at least the beginning of the end for poverty in this region.

Speaker 1:          14:06          So the question now is, what do you think these positive predictions do you think they'll become true? Is this a good time to invest in Djibouti or is this going to amount to nothing more than just hopeful predictions? Well, do leave your answer in the comments section below.
