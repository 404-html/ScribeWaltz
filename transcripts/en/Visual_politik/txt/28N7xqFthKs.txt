Speaker 1:          00:07          California is one of the states with the highest taxes in all of America. There's also one of the most expensive places to live. If this wasn't bad enough, the California and government is never ending risk of bankruptcy with a brutal amounts of debt and to launch fiscal,

Speaker 1:          00:26          but despite all of this, California is home to the third richest and most prosperous region on the planet. Yes, dear viewers, of course, I'm talking about the Santa Clara Valley. What do you say? You've never heard of it? Well, actually I have because it's better known by its own official name of Silicon Valley. This is the place where companies like Google, apple, and facebook were all born in total. Thirty nine of the 100 biggest companies in the entire world have their headquarters in this place, but make no mistake. Silicon valley is not a big metropolis like New York City or London. In fact, the opposite. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Straight

Speaker 1:          01:10          cities like Cupertino, Palo Alto and mountain view have a little more than 60,000 inhabitants. Menlo Park where facebook headquarters are located as a smaller population than a small town in Kansas, but in this region, the average salary, so policy is $10,000 a month and it's home to many of the world's largest billionaires. And if you're wondering, the answer is no. There is no silicon mine in the Santa Clara Valley whatsoever. In fact, the name Silicon Valley was coined in the 19 seventies because this is when microchips and semiconductors made out of silicon manufacturer.

Speaker 2:          01:44          Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Don't go looking for any natural resources in this part of the world because you won't find any. So now we come to the real question of why here? I mean, what's so special about this area? Why not northern California or why not New York or Chicago or any other place for that matter? That was easy to understand why somewhere like Switzerland is so rich, they have low taxes and an excellent political system than Saudi Arabia and they're rich because they've got oil. The silicon valley is very different from those places and it's very different from other places in America. For one, it's got those high taxes we mentioned and believe me, the taxes are really, really high.

Speaker 3:          02:24          For example, imagine that you a top executive and you make half a million bucks a year. If you lived in Texas, you'd pay around 32 percent in income tax.

Speaker 2:          02:36          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:39          However, in California you would pay 42 percent. As you can see, the difference is meaningful.

Speaker 1:          02:45          So again, why Silicon Valley and North Texas or Delaware or Nevada, what makes this region quite so special for startup, and even more importantly than that, well, what is a start up and how is created well in today's we're going to answer all of those questions, but before we do, let's have a look back at the history. The trader is there all times in history when several coincidences happen all at once and this, this is the miracle of cylinder. Our story starts in the year 1956 with a company called Shockley semiconductor lab. They were the first company in the valley to manufacturers silicon based micro jets. Their offices were in a little village with no more than 7,000 inhabitants. This was a village called mountain view located on the outskirts of San Francisco.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Back then, nobody talked about silicon valley, but of course the San Francisco Peninsula was one of the tech capitals of America night. It's actually the radon is used by the army were manufactured by a company that you might have heard of, Hewlett Packard. Further, Stanford University generated skilled professionals ready to work in rocket science, but let's get back to art. Friends are shopping. They were the most advanced company in their fields and perhaps this company could have gone very, very far. Bonds, they had a big problem, apparently people in the company who felt that their boss was a bit of a

Speaker 2:          04:11          Dick,

Speaker 1:          04:15          and so what happens? Well, one day, eight of the youngest work isn't. The company went to Mr Shockley his office and essentially said Shockley, you could take your stupid ass company and stick it up your ass. We're the ones who designed your technology. We're the brains of this business, so we're going to get outta here, start our own business and kick ass without you. These eight, and then became known as the traitorous eight. Their average age was 30, they had no money whatsoever and they wanted to start a state of the art technology company that required a lot of investments and you might be thinking now, well, which banks lend the money and the answer to that is absolutely not. However, pay attention here because this was the beginning of something really, really big in 1959, the first venture capital funded company. It was born, but hold on a second year because I do want to explain what that actually means. You have an idea since the beginning of capitalism, there have been people with money willing to partner with people who had ideas and together they started companies. Nonetheless. After World War Two, lots of soldiers came home from the battlefields and one out of every two veterans they wanted to start a company

Speaker 2:          05:36          and

Speaker 1:          05:36          all of a sudden there was a spike in demand for financing. This is why many of the people with money started rethinking the way that businesses use to work. For instance, there's Laurance Rockefeller from the famous Rockefeller family. This man had something more than lots of money. He also knew other people who had money, so essentially one day in 1959, he called them all up and said, listen up ditch chops, put down your champagne glasses and your caviar for a second, the shy and your monocle and pay attention because I just found eight guys in California who have a great business idea that very, very clever and they want to develop some weird stuff with lots of technology. It's got silicone and other things I don't understand, but if you fancy this idea, give me your money invested in said business, and if it all goes well, will become even richer than we are now. Pip, pip, and say it wasn't was sad, so it was done. This is how in 1959, the traitorous eight from Silicon Valley started fairchild semiconductors with the money from Rockefeller and his billionaire friends. This was the first time. It wasn't just one rich dude investing, but a collective society of rich dudes instead, and this. This is how the first venture capital fund called Venn rock associated was born, and guess where they have their headquarters. Of course, that's Palo Alto. This was silicon,

Speaker 1:          07:06          so this was a really risky idea and that's why these funds are call of venture capital funds. I mean, if you put your money into a big company like Coca Cola, you'll lose or win a little bit of money, but it's really hard to go fully bankrupt nonetheless, giving money to a guy with nothing but an idea that's a pretty risky Joel. So well, what's the advantage? Then? Of course it's that if it goes right, you get stupidly rich and so then we have to answer the question, well, what's the secret of success? Of course you do want to invest in lots of different companies at the same time. You need just one out of 10 to be successful to make it worthwhile. And the truth is that Rockefeller and his other fellows made a hell of an investment. Actually, the company still exists today and has offices all over the world, and so what happens when one person gets stupidly rich by doing something?

Speaker 1:          07:58          Well, a lot of copycats spring up out of the blue trying to do the same thing by the year. Nineteen 82. There were already 12 vc funds in silicon valley, their philosophy, it was simple, get private money from investors, pension plans, and of course all those rich dudes and then a team of specialized professionals meet entrepreneurs and startups looking for good ideas. In summary, silicon valley has an old car of guys who study at Stanford. Clever guys. You study somewhere else, but eventually emigrated till the valley. A network of companies that make it easy to start any business. Of course, a ton of money. All right. All right, so this all sounds pretty cool, but what does a Silicon Valley company actually look like? How does this startup system and VC funds actually work? Well, let's have a look. Shall We? Silicon Valley way. I know I know the word stars. I'm has already become another buzzword that stupid people used to sound smarter. So then. Well, what is the difference between a normal company and a startup? Well, here's a good definition. It is a company designed to grow fast. Paul Graham, founder of Yahoo Store and venture capital investor. All right, so now I can probably guess what you're thinking. I mean, company is designed to grow fast. Well actually no, just look at Ikea is a good example. Ikea is one of the most successful companies of all time, but his main principles since the beginning has been to grow only with its own funds. No debt from banks or hedge fund

Speaker 1:          09:33          that unlike other companies, Ikea took a long time to grow, but he was healthy, consistent growth. So now the question still remains. What is a startup? Well, facebook would be a great example here. Why? First of all, because it's a scalable business. This means it doesn't matter if they have one or a million uses. The spending is almost the same, but not only that. Facebook is the perfect example of what we know as the startup financing cycle and pay attention here because this. This is really key in understanding how silicon valley

Speaker 2:          10:05          wow

Speaker 1:          10:09          first step is what we know as the valley of death. Why is it called this? Well, because this is the stage when most projects don't survive. In the case of facebook, we have our friends, Mark Zuckerberg and Edwardo Savrin who had a great business idea, but an idea by itself has little or no use. You have to execute on it. So these new friends, they put down money out of their own pockets to launch their first prototype, which was the facebook.com and well, you know the rest of the story. Suddenly all of the students, Harvard University, they had an account next stage. Well that was to become a serious company with work as officers and other important stuff like that and valeant bought and stuff. You need money as well. Did they have any money? Well, no. So what did they do while they went to silicon valley and they met this guy at that you see here, his name is Peter

Speaker 2:          11:07          and

Speaker 1:          11:07          listen up here because this is the first difference between the valley and the rest of the world. He's a teal is what we know as an angel investor. He's a guy with a lot of money and he's willing to invest in companies that are still in this valley of death at this moment, 2004. Facebook was an idea with a lot of potential, but almost no profit investment. It was so risky that no bank woodlands any money to them. So instead Peter Teal, but $500,000 into facebook with this, he was buying 10 percent of the company and now you might be wondering, well, why just 10 percent at the end of the day? Back then facebook, it wasn't worth anything with so much money invested. Peter Teal could have demanded a bigger share of the company and to be fair, that is absolutely true if they were located somewhere like Alabama.

Speaker 1:          11:52          So they began offering competing good conditions to the entrepreneur nurse. So if he asks for too many shares of the company is knocking bag and sovereign would just have gone to somebody else. Don't worry there. Everybody. Peter Thiel is still extraordinarily rich. All right, so you're probably beginning to understand why it's a good idea to start companies yet, but hold on a minute because you ain't seen nothing yet with all million dollars, facebook's founders could start building something big, something that could be sold to the mass market. Really, this is the moment when a company proves itself successful or not. The moment when they survive the valley of death, while they don't. If facebook was founded in Alabama, they would have probably stopped here. They had a product it worked out and the money to live on and the story, but remember this is a startup and it's goal is to grow as fast as it possibly can.

Speaker 1:          12:41          This is where those vc funds came into the shop. We're not talking about a Peter Teal guy with a lot of money here. We're talking about companies with even more money and the team of advisors. This is important because in many cases vc funders can make vital decisions in the company and even tell the founders how they have to design their corporate structure, who they can partner with or even how and when to expand internationally. All right, so coming back to our facebook story, in the year 2005, a vc fund called Excel partners put 12 point $7,000,000 into facebook with this. They owned 13 percent of the company.

Speaker 4:          13:20          As an aside, if you remember Peter Teal bought 10 percent of facebook with half a million dollars and the less excel partners subsequently paid 12 point $7,000,000 for 13 percent of the company. If you do the math, you see that from one day to the next, facebook is now valued at $98 million dollars. In other words, in just one year Peter teals investment increased by 2000 percent.

Speaker 1:          13:42          Pretty impressive, right? But again, hold on because yes, still haven't seen anything yet. This ansel partners investment is what we call a series a investments. And if there's a series a, it's because later we have a series B, series c. alright, so in the case of facebook, the series c funding was Microsoft. He paid $240,000,000 in 2007 for this $240,000,000. They were getting just one point six percent of facebook, so let's return to our maths because it's pretty mind blowing. Facebook is now valued at $15,000,000,000. This means that that 10 percent, the Pto ball for half a million dollars is now worth 300 percent more.

Speaker 2:          14:27          Oh,

Speaker 1:          14:30          alright. So this means that if you regular viewer had invested just a hundred dollars in facebook in the year 2004, you'd now have enough money to buy a waterfront house with a swimming pool and a mini golf course. All right, so hold on a moment because at this point you might be wondering, well hold on a second. Simon, was facebook actually worth $15,000,000,000 at that moment? Did they really make enough money to that crazy $240,000,000 investments? Well, no, but you see by investing all that money, you get lots and lots of things, things that sooner or later what ends up making you a profit and this, this is when we get to the final stage of a startup, but we sell it to a big company or do we go public? Facebook? They decided to enter the stock market, but many other startups will typically be sold to big multinational company.

Speaker 5:          15:20          I pull back exam in $400,000,000

Speaker 1:          15:24          and yes, I know what you are going to tell me. All right Simon, this sounds really, really good, but I just don't believe it's that easy and why you'd be absolutely Ryan's because nine out of 10 startups fail, but importantly, you just need one to succeed to make a lot of people crazy, crazy, rich. This is why the goal of so many politicians now is to make that own silicon valley

Speaker 5:          15:52          white Bernadine silicon alley is Europe's new silicon, the Mexicans, silicon

Speaker 2:          16:02          volume

Speaker 5:          16:05          Africa near Silicon Valley's.

Speaker 1:          16:07          Yep. Everybody wants to have their own silicon valley in their own back yard. Well, everybody except for those people who actually lived in silicon

Speaker 5:          16:18          lit are abandoning silicon valley in droves,

Speaker 1:          16:22          but that is something we're going to actually talk about in our next video. Meanwhile, the big question is this, do you think we can replicate the silicon valley model in other countries? While please do leave your answer in the comments section below.
