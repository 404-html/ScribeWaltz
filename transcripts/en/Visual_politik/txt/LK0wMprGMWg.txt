Speaker 1:          00:07          I'm going to start off today's video by asking you a question and please don't Google it overwhelmed you just read the title of the episode, but it doesn't really matter anyway. We're betting for you didn't know, but I can go into with the world's most expensive country and if you did well, well done to you. Well, when it comes to expensive places to live, most people think of New York or Hong Kong or is uric. Well, that's not even close to right. The world's most expensive sitting is Luanda the capital city of Angola and Yep. That's an African

Speaker 2:          00:36          country.

Speaker 1:          00:40          So rented apartments in Luanda. You can end up paying over $5,000 a month. How about the cost of a big Mac menu? Mackey, Ds, well bounce. Nineteen American donors and if you want to have an internet connection at home, well you better hope you've got a healthy bank balance because that's going to cost you around $300 a month. And they were not kidding. All right, so 91, five. You wondering what that was going on in Angola? Is this some sort of extremely wealthy country that. No one knows about. Well No. The Republic of Angola is one of the world's biggest oil exporters, surpassing other oil rich countries like Qatar. Nevertheless, half of its population has no access to clean

Speaker 2:          01:21          modern.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Every three children suffer from malnutrition and one out of every six dies before reaching five years ago,

Speaker 2:          01:34          a

Speaker 1:          01:38          on the other ends of the spectrum and to is home to one of the wealthiest women on the planet. That would be Isabelle dos Santos, who by the way is the daughter of former presidents and Jay said, sounds awesome. Yeah. Might be figuring out what's going on here. Oh yes, I go, La is one of the most corrupt countries on the planets. Indeed, it was home to one of the biggest financial fiascos in reason years with several companies losing billions of dollars in this country. While perhaps this is no surprise to you, I mean at the end of the day and go, there is still a third world country. Nevertheless, that is a question that must be asked here. How did they get here? How could the country possibly have such a bizarre economy? And more importantly, how is it possible that the ruling party managers to keep control of this country? Well, today we're going to answer those questions, but first we do need to have a look at it.

Speaker 2:          02:40          Great.

Speaker 1:          02:45          And diplomacy. First thing we need to understand when we talk about Africa is the most of the African countries were colonies in past centuries.

Speaker 2:          02:58          European

Speaker 1:          02:59          like Belgium,

Speaker 2:          03:00          France and Portugal, invaded and most of the continents imposing rules and treating the natives like animals and go to it wasn't an exception until 1975. Portugal made a fortune with its diamond mines in the country. Nevertheless, in that city, the Portuguese government push to by the UN and its own people recognized and Gunas self determination. And then the question was, what happens after a country stops being a colony who takes care of the governmental affairs after the European colonizers?

Speaker 1:          03:34          Well, instead of answering this question by calling for elections, the many angerland trines created different from zen started the civil war. Well, that was a conflict that then when's the last 25 years? And there are still parts of the country today where you call them go because they're just covered in lamb's mind is in case you don't know what landmine is, it is a bomb that you bury underground. Then when someone steps on, it explodes as well. Now you might be wondering how is it possible that such a poor country could afford all of these weapons and it was a big long civil. Well, we almost have that one lies in the diamonds that we previously mentioned. All signs of the conflict sold diamonds and in exchange God arms. But we've provided these arms will often 19, 76. When true civil war kicks off, there were two sides. On the one hand, there was the units agreed who dominated the south of the country, units that were supported by South Africa, China, and to a lesser extent, the United States, the days of the Cold War and every war in any parts of the globe was seen as a good opportunity to weaken Soviet influence. Plus it was known that Angola had oil reserves. It's also explains why the Soviet Union wanted to take part in the conflict too. They were supporters of the Angolan People's liberation movements or as they called it, the MPLA, but most of the world leader of the Mpla was Josie, Eduardo dos Santos Santos did have the support of the Soviet Union, but interestingly, the country that offered the most support was actually cute

Speaker 1:          05:10          and we're following our treatment nationalists duty, but don't. Right. He didn't stop at selling weapons to dos Santos. He sends over 30,000 troops to the country. Let's not only that, during the lengthy macy's, the area that was under the MPLA control received a lot of doctors and engineers from Ivana.

Speaker 2:          05:28          This explain.

Speaker 1:          05:30          That's partly why dos Santos one, the conflict. In fact, despite the war still be ongoing during the 19 nineties, this man had taken control of most of the country. However, that Cuban help, well, it wasn't as useful as you might think. For example, the agriculture experts in from Cuba tried to grow sugarcane on Angolan soil, but there's apparently those seeds were not good for the kind of soil that you find in Angola.

Speaker 2:          05:57          And this

Speaker 1:          05:57          is why within just a few years, most of the farming lands in the country, it became totally infertile. This meant stole vacation for Angolans and an anger towards the Cuban help. Alright, so as if this really wasn't enough after the collapse of the Soviet Union at Water Dot Santos, realize that it's a good idea to the friends, the capitalist country, at the end of the day, these were the countries which would buy their oil. On the other hand is America was not helping eunice hair anymore. So what does this country need to do to become an ally of the so called free wealth? Well, BEC was only one thing to do when that was removed the word Marxist from their vocabulary and swap it out for free market democracy. And yes, I do say that with a touch of sarcasm because Angolan capitalism. Well, that's certainly one of a kind. You're seeing the Angolan way yet. Two thousand and two, it was a turning point in [inaudible] history. Eduardo Cental signed the peace agreements with his adversaries since then, unit has become a political party with a right to run for elections for the first time in history and garlands. Could enjoy democracy, but not so many vast. In the very same year. Another meaningful thing

Speaker 1:          07:15          makes burst ultra deep water, oil discovery off the coast of Angola. Suddenly I'm Buddha, became an oil juggernaut selling tons of dinosaur juice to China in the United States in just five years. I can go to the multiplied by four

Speaker 3:          07:31          and go let's. Capital was being rebuilt. The varied architecture from the fifties and sixties is giving way to new office towers that are being built between the national corporate sector and then and government

Speaker 1:          07:43          companies like Exxon mobile in the U. S or bp and the UK invested heavily in Angola and of course they sent engineers and workers to live in the capital. All the little ones up and of course these people wanted good quality houses, cool bars and these same kinds of goods that they could fly back home. But all of those things that have the fines in the country that years, the fort was having a big old civil war. In other words, the supply was small man's yet the demand. We didn't stop growing. As a result, the prices of Western goods went absolutely sky high,

Speaker 3:          08:13          built for 500,000 people. The angerland capitalists now accommodating an estimated 5 million. Even civil servants with comfortable salaries have

Speaker 1:          08:24          well making ends meet was wait just a minute because there's more. Imagine we have a construction company in China and we want to build a housing block in new enza. Well, the first thing we want to do is register a company, right? Well, that process can take six months during that time. That's perfectly normal that the government fines and lots of problems and they ask me for this paper, that registry, and that's how the report that you probably don't have the sort of report that a nice stack of cash and they do a sweaty palm under a table, could probably

Speaker 2:          08:53          and

Speaker 1:          08:57          does have a reports made by organizations like Transparency International. Almost every company who does business in Angola has had to do with some sort of bribery. The government's official, but wait just a minute because this is still not the end of it.

Speaker 3:          09:11          Those oil companies like Exxon Mobil or British Petroleum that we're willing to do business in Angola as they were, had to establish partnerships with the government or so and goal the Angola state

Speaker 2:          09:21          company

Speaker 1:          09:26          now have a guest who is the head of that company. Well, and yes, that was all friend we mentioned earlier, Isabelle dos Santos, the daughter of the former presidents of the country. This explains why Isabelle tell became the wealthiest women in Africa in so

Speaker 3:          09:43          every major Angolan investment held by dos Santos stemmed from taking a chunk of a company that wants to do business in the country or from a stroke of the president's pen that cut her into the action

Speaker 1:          09:53          for all of this. On the governments have dos Santos, the father of restricted access to the country for international journalists. In fact, most of the corruption scandals, we know what else I've been discovered by the governments of the US.

Speaker 2:          10:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Of course, with a political kind of like this, no, I can go then wanted to start a company, but at the end of the day, the reality was that you needed to be a millionaire in order to pay those barriers. Brian's men's. Even if we would put the cost of bribery aside just with the basic bureaucracy, you need a thousand US dollars to start a normal bar in windsor in the country, as poor as I can get under a thousand dollars isn't absolutely not only that, these international companies were not willing to invest in the country more than the absolute minimum required

Speaker 3:          10:39          to extract the oil. So now you might wonder what were the consequences of all this well outcome is that dinosaur juice is the only and Golan export back in the last decade, the only new and Golan businesses were crude oil extraction plants and houses for its workers. By the year 2014 oil represented 97 percent of end goal exports.

Speaker 2:          11:05          No.

Speaker 1:          11:07          This point, if you're a regular visual politic via you might be thinking, this sounds pretty familiar to me. That's probably because you've seen on videos on Venezuela, a country with a similar economic system. John's like, what happens in Nicolas? Maduro has country. When the oil market price went down, then Garla went right along with it. So now let's get onto the example of the Chinese construction companies. Many companies from China invested millions building entire neighborhoods, facts that professionals coming to the country, but now there's no more oil industry then therefore there's no more workers.

Speaker 3:          11:38          Four lane highways without cause schools with no pupils and under five years a Chinese company built Columbia using oil credit lines with China, but parts of Columbia, I feel like a ghost town in summary, that is only

Speaker 1:          11:54          one winner in that story, and that person is who sandwell dude or Santos and his daughter Isabelle, who has already invested these enormous profits overseas. Most of the big Portuguese firms from galp to Unitel. Now under the control of this family. If Portugal was a colonizer in the past, well, they've now become Angola's money launderer out and golden elites have sent an estimated $119,000,000,000 out of the country. And while the entire country is having a crisis, Isabelle dos Santos, who identifies herself as entrepreneur on our twitter account, goes out with celebrities like Kim called Dashi, and all of this being said, you might have guessed the dos Santos family is not that popular here. Now you go there,

Speaker 2:          12:36          right?

Speaker 1:          12:41          Really, in fact, that political party, the MPLA keeps stealing the show election after election getting over 70 percent of the votes this past August 2017. Angola held an electric despite the fact that juice Eduardo Dot Santos was not a does anymore. His party at one end game. I'm so now you might be wondering, well, why does this happen? Well, I'm afraid that we're probably never going to need rejects. EU election observers. And now the question really becomes, is it going to be possible for Angola to get rid of this corrupt ruling class? Can lead follow the trends of those African lions like gone or older ones that.
