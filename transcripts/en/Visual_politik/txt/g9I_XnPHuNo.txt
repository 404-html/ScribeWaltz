Speaker 1:          00:00          Here's a question for you. How much does the U s actually pay for its army and all the military operations that they carry out day after day, all over the

Speaker 2:          00:07          wow.

Speaker 1:          00:12          Well, that's precisely what we're going to try and answer in this video. But there's no debate when it comes to one thing. And that's the, they're military industry is one of the most opaque, most influential hands, most powerful industries in the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:24          It's,

Speaker 1:          00:26          well that's true for the United States as it is for pretty much anywhere else in the world too. So I'm starting the question that I posed to just a moment ago. It means no more or no less than opening a debate with a rather large implications for, in this case, the bill. And it could be hundreds of billions of dollars. So having given that wanting, uh, let's see what is happening within the corridors of both the, again and the Capitol talking about the u s army is going to involve exorbitant figures as well as a huge amount of bureaucracy and political machinery. So big amps, so opaque is this institution that we can practically talk about. A parallel governor.

Speaker 2:          01:10          Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:10          In 2015 a report and made by the Pentagon itself stated that they had to pay tens of billions or pizza, tens of billions of dollars every year for extra costs caused by bad management practices in the army. Best Practices such as paying private contractors, more money than would be expected in a competitive market. We're going to be in peril because we're spending dollars like it doesn't matter. Robert L stine managing director chartwell capital management and former chairman of the defense business board, and do you know think that it's only the big military industrial companies, those who produce fighters, missiles, and other military equipment? Not at all. In fact, a good part of all of those billions that have operated each year come from activities such as accounting, logistics, or human resources. You heard that,

Speaker 2:          01:54          right?

Speaker 1:          01:56          In fact, the bureaucracy of the US armed forces this super big, that's it. Employees, no less than a million people. Take a look at this graphic from the Washington Post. As you can see, the u s army, it has almost as many people in its officer's doing administrative activities as it does people who are preparing for war or performing national security tasks. I had all of this, of course, it comes with an enormous costs. Almost a quarter of the military budget is invested in these types of tasks, tasks, that's all, well, let's say importance, but I really, a quarter of the money,

Speaker 1:          02:35          if you consider it another way, all of this bureaucracy alone by itself, counselors, the third largest military budget in the world, which actually wouldn't be too far behind the second biggest military budget and that sort of China, and that's not all according to a study by the Department of Defense itself, published in October, 2017 approximately one out of every five installations that the again has do nothing being synthy sit idle and they could be closed with no military consequences whatsoever. And this would save millions of dollars per year per each one. But this is something that isn't really quite supported by the politicians in Washington. Everything that has to do with the Pentagon and the US Defense Department involves talking about some gigantic, hyper bureaucratic and very, very expensive structures. Well, as we're going to see later in this video, all of this waste is very important in the political debate, but for now, let's see how much money these military adventures really costs the United States.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Okay,

Speaker 1:          03:42          cost of war.

Speaker 2:          03:46          Does he know?

Speaker 1:          03:47          Just say says military adventures aren't randy that strange if we count the Cold War, the United States has been at war since 1941

Speaker 2:          03:58          homicide.

Speaker 1:          03:59          It's, we all know it since the end of 2001 the u s military has been involved in active combat every year. Syria operations in the Indian Ocean, Africa, Yemen, and Eastern Europe and above all Iraq and Afghanistan. It doesn't look like it's ending anytime soon. So now with all of this going on all around the world, can you imagine how much this stuff costs? Well, pay attention here because the numbers are probably more scandalous than you think.

Speaker 1:          04:26          Cool. Before we get into these numbers, let's mention a quick side note here. One thing is the annual defense budgets and another thing is the operating budgets. This means that when we hear about how much the US spends on its army, the cost of wars and military operations themselves, arms usually taken into account all the factors there. Since 2001 US taxpayers have spent just in those military adventures and loan a whopping one point $7 trillion, one point $7 trillion by the way, is more than Canada's GDP and almost as much as Italy's put it another way in today's dollars that is more than twice what the Vietnam War costs or five times that of the cost of the Korean War bought DB Capitol Hill. Because if you think this is a high figure, well wait just a minute because we aren't done yet.

Speaker 3:          05:15          Cool

Speaker 1:          05:15          of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars for example, isn't over, and I'm not referring only to the military expenditures that or has, but also to the costs that have already occurred, which the federal governments will have to pay for in the future.

Speaker 3:          05:27          Of course costs

Speaker 1:          05:31          such as long term medical care for ex combatants due to injuries produced in combat expenses for veterans, and of course the cost of the debts incurred to finance the war in total estimate states that these p was alone. Again, it ends up costing between four and $6 trillion. That is just a vast amount of money to get some idea of the real costs here. This is the equivalent to all of the military expenditure for all European NATO countries for the next 15 to 23 years. All of these military adventures, they are a total financial, yeah,

Speaker 2:          05:59          mess.

Speaker 1:          06:02          Well, we think that countries should take a look at these bills and be more prudent in the future. For example, when one visits to the United States, something that draws the attention is the poor state of its infrastructure, its roads, its metro, its railroads, et cetera. In fact, infrastructure in the u s has the guns to be a serious problem. We spend trillions and trillions of dollars outside of our nation, but we can't build a road, a highway, a tunnel, a bridge in our own nation and we watch everything falling into district.

Speaker 2:          06:32          Yeah. Well

Speaker 1:          06:36          with what the Iraq and Afghanistan wars of costs, the United States could have the best infrastructure in the world.

Speaker 2:          06:42          Wow.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Pasta 30 years. The American hat, 13 walls spanning 14 point $2 trillion. What if the spread of proud of them money on building up the infrastructure? What if the money spin on the Middle East, middle west of the United States, developing the industry there, that could be changed a lot. So it's not peep the other countries stew jobs from your guys. It is your strategy. So far I think things are quite clear. We have now seen how much Washington is military adventures around the world if cost the American people. No, I think it's going to be interesting to see how much the federal government really spends every year on the fence. Hands. I'm going to say that if you haven't been surprised so far, you probably are about to be

Speaker 2:          07:30          done.

Speaker 4:          07:33          Scott. We dominate the sea. We dominate the land and space

Speaker 1:          07:46          crew, military expenditure.

Speaker 2:          07:47          Sure.

Speaker 1:          07:50          More or less than the US defense budget is by far the largest in the wells. Consider 2017 as an example. In this year of $560 billion were spent on the fence, and of course we also have to add that $60 billion for operating expenses. This is approximately three times the military expenditure of China, or nine times the military expenditure of Russia. However, these amounts don't, dude, all of the expenses that the military well generates for the u s government. Consider for example, the cost of medical treatment for those wounded in combat or the costs of veteran expenses. Have a quick look at this

Speaker 2:          08:21          scruff.

Speaker 1:          08:25          Yes. As you can see, if we take all of these expenses into account that the armed forces expenses rise above $900 billion par. Yeah, that's nearly a trillion dollars and we still need to consider it national security expenses like financing intelligence agencies such as the CIA, but even if we only take the department of Defense and nuclear weapons budgets, which is $620 billion, we can see how the military efforts in GDP terms is one of the largest in the world. However you want to look at those numbers. They are exorbitant, but before we finish answering today's question, let's just wait for a moment because the u s military dominance is somewhat less impressive when we consider the following factors. First price difference. That is you comms by the same things with $1 in the u s as you can with $1 in China. If we correct this, we would see that the u s military expenditure would be equal to the sum of China and Russia's military expenditure. It's still an enormous amounts, but it's not as impressive. Pins and this is really important, we have to consider how things have changed in recent. Yes, allow me to explain her in constant dollars. That is adjusting for inflation. Real defense expenditures have actually fallen since 2010 by 25% this is unquestionably the largest reduction in decades and in a way, this is what is great. You're worrying many analysts and politicians in Washington, especially the Republican Party,

Speaker 5:          10:00          I understand we're in an election year. I understand all that, but how in the world do you refuse to take up legislation that is only purpose is to defend this nation, which is under a shop. We rely on these young men and women. We rely on them to defend the nation and now we won't even act to train, equip, pay, and care for them.

Speaker 1:          10:22          Could it be that despite all the money for the U S is spending today on defense, it's still isn't enough? Well, let's consider it.

Speaker 2:          10:29          Yes.

Speaker 1:          10:33          Waning power

Speaker 2:          10:37          since

Speaker 1:          10:38          fall of the Soviet Union. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          10:40          yeah, yeah, Yup. That all of you. Yeah. You said

Speaker 1:          10:46          z consequent Dan's of the Cold War. It could be expected that the size of the United States armed forces has decreased substantially. We're talking about fewer submarines, fewer aircraft carriers, fewer bombers, fewer soldiers, et Cetera, et cetera. How has the new equipment has arrived such as the aft 22 wraps or the b two bomber, the f 35 a new class of aircraft carriers, new cruisers, and among other things, high precision drones and miss

Speaker 1:          11:16          what all of this technological innovation has had two consequences. On the one hand it has increased the u s military capabilities, but on the other hand it has altered equipments and operational costs and of course as we've seen, the budget has been decreasing in recent years. Years of underfunding have given us a weakened force that despite the hard work of our brave troops is ill equipped to handle the missions. We keep throwing at it. Edwin j fullmer, founder and president of the Heritage Foundation do you to all of this, the Republican Party, and also it must be said, a large part of the Democratic Party seem to have something quite clear in their minds. The military budget must be increased.

Speaker 6:          11:54          Currently

Speaker 1:          11:55          the smallest army since 1940

Speaker 6:          11:59          our navy is at its smallest size. Since 1917 I would send weapons. You were crane. The first thing we need to do to make America stronger as a strength of our military

Speaker 1:          12:11          as candidates for the presidency and famous Arizona Senator John Mccain, who incidentally is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee of the sentence, is one of the politicians. He was most committed to this issue and has proposed raising the military budgets to $800 billion. They say that the current scas military budget, for example, of course the accidents that the u s navy has had in the Pacific, US Navy relieves admiral in charge of seventh fleet in wake of deadly disaster at see, this is as well as causing new and emerging threats such as that if North Korea or an increasingly strong China, and as you can imagine, dealing with these increasing threats is not going to be

Speaker 6:          12:44          she

Speaker 1:          12:46          doing and modernizing the nuclear arsenal that is, and nuclear weapons bombers, missiles, and submarines is trump promised, implies an investment in the next 30 years of more than one point $2 trillion. However, if you spend more than anyone else, much more, in fact, and you all still note Belita, shouldn't you perhaps be rethinking your strategy should in the u s perhaps modifying his role in some way so it's not as involved in so many conflicts around the world. And further there's the question of whether military expenditure, it really helps national security or does it really just help the arms industry. And it's important to note here that that arms industry does generously finance lobbyists and political campaigns. Well, if he's hanging out the questions and the answers that pretty much are your penance, but now it's your turn. Do you think that the u s should increase its military budgets?
