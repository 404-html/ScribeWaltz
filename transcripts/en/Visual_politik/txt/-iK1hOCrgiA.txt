Speaker 1:          00:00          History has shown us that sometimes the impossible happens. Mikhail Gorbachev went from leading of a Soviet Union, the face as a North American multinational company.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Sometimes nothing brings people together. Pizza,

Speaker 1:          00:34          so will we ever see something like this in North Korea? Well, listen up. North Korea is a very, very poor country. The available estimates state that their per capita production value is 50 times smaller than that of South Korea. Less than 1000 kilometers of their roads are paved. The average life expectancy is the lowest in the entire region, and despite having received humanitarian aid for more than 22 years, there's still poverty all over. The country

Speaker 1:          01:15          is not even the west of it. The worst is a total lack of respect for human rights. The North Koreans live under an iron pans, dictatorship, and the police state where political prisoners amounts to tens and tens of thousands. In fact, according to the United Nations, there could be between 80 and a hundred and 20,000 political prisoners in reeducation camps in North Korea. The state controls everything, but hold on just a moment because in recent years and important change seems to have occurred in the country a change that has a lot to do with money, with commerce into, with the market. You see theoretically North Korea as the last large country, the last launch state with a communist ideology here practically everything is directed, organized, manufactured, and provided for by the state, including housing, health, education, food, employments, access.

Speaker 2:          02:06          True.

Speaker 1:          02:10          This is all in theory and the truth. The truth is very different. You see, the states has a great deal of limitations. Basically, it's becoming less and less able to do stuff. Allow me to explain. Many of the states, factories and farms productivity levels are absolutely on the floor and additionally in many cases, as a result of very old machinery, backwoods production methods, international sanctions, and even electrical supply problems for a great part of their time. Production centers, they aren't even open.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Did all

Speaker 1:          02:43          of this. A new private economy has gained strength in recent years from which more and more North Koreans now depends in order to survive and improve their living standards. Now, hold on just a second, because a private sector in North Korea with markets and with capitalism, it sounds pretty, but you absolutely have to write and listen to this

Speaker 3:          03:08          new North Korean market.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:12          dvr. When Kim Jon was officially declared supreme leader, that is the absolute dictator of North Korea on December the 28th, 2011, many analysts thought that things could change in the country. At the end of the day. This was a generational change that was bringing a 28 year olds in the power that 28 year olds who had studied abroad in Switzerland. However, it became clear that some things weren't going to change. North Korea's new leader, Kim Jong UN has turned out to be just as terrible as his father was. The purges, the inhuman punishments, the rampant persecution, the leader centered Coulson's. In short, you complete control of citizens' lives have continued to being this regimes main characteristics,

Speaker 3:          03:55          religion from birth. You've learned about the Kim family, learned that they are gods, that you must be absolutely obedient to the Kim family. The elites are treated nicely and because of that they make sure that the system stays stable, but for everyone else it's a reign of terror. A doctor who worked at a hospital in North Korea and now works as a doctor at a hospital in South Korea,

Speaker 1:          04:17          however they have you a sentence can. Johnathan came to power. Something surprising has happened, dozens of markets when North Koreans trade privately have opened throughout the country, a new class of merchants and entrepreneurs is growing in North Korea. In fact, according to the Career Institute for National Unification around 1 million people working directly in these markets which have already become one of the main sources of wealth in the country. Now, you want me to run during right now, but Simon, hold on a second. How did those markets kind of out? Well, let me tell you first that they don't have the most glamorous or happiest of beginnings. You see, it all started in the 19 nineties when famine caused by government mistakes, lack of resources, weather conditions, and the collapse of the Soviet Union reeks absolute havoc.

Speaker 2:          05:12          Tree

Speaker 1:          05:15          midstate, the between one to 2 million people died of starvation right at the time when North Koreans were struggling to survive. The first markets arose, places where people could exchange anything they could to get resources with which they could buy food,

Speaker 3:          05:30          realize that if we did nothing, we would die of hunger. So we started to trade Ju Yung

Speaker 1:          05:35          suddenly dozens and dozens of markets appeared throughout the country saving thousands and thousands of lives. That's precisely why the regime didn't persecute to this type of private activity, as you might expect. Kim Jong, Il, the current leaders. Father, let's just say that sometimes he tolerated these markets and sometimes he decided to repress them. But since Kim Jong Uhm, came to power, the number of private markets is multiplied and satellite images show that they don't stop growing. Now the government government's authorized as many of these markets and exchange for renting out spaces to the nutshell.

Speaker 2:          06:13          Yep,

Speaker 1:          06:13          that's right. The Pyongyang government is taking advantage of this new private economy, but well, how much? Well, according to the Career Institute for National Unification is calculations. They get more than 220,000 American dollars per day, so precisely for this reason recently the government isn't only promoting these markets, but it's also granting visas to many Chinese entrepreneurs and traders to further stimulate this economic activity, but to you it does not end that because while listening to this, it's only the activity of regulated markets that's growing. It's also of the unofficial markets. That is those that don't have the authorities official approval, the black market. Seeing this all works in the following way, in an economic parallel to the public sector. People can make everything. They can choose sweets, clothes and naturally they tried to sell these products in the market and to get money and the currencies, they're hoping for probably 10 or even American dollars, but even so, it's estimated that 80 percent of the product sold in North Korean markets come from China. In other words, illegal trade, which happens behind the government's back also crosses the border. It's crossing the border in huge and ever growing volume.

Speaker 1:          07:41          Many of these unofficial markets are becoming a window to the outside world for many North Koreans because Dvo in these places, you can even buy a usb stick full of a foreign movies and shows including Hollywood productions. We saw four and programming. We had to close all the doors and curtains and pretend that there was nobody home. Dan became so you might be wondering, well, contraband crossing borders, why aren't gods in the security services doing something about this? Why are they tolerating this illegal trade? Well, basically for two reasons,

Speaker 2:          08:13          the

Speaker 1:          08:15          is that in Pyongyang there doesn't seem to be much pressure to combat these markets and we're going to see wine and moments and seconds because the soldiers and border guards are also a part of the business and sometimes even lends a hand. That's right. A common method of payments according to many of the traders who now live outside of North Korea, is to deliver packs of cigarettes stuffed with money to the police and soldiers. While the fact is that these international merchants byproducts in the North Korean authorized markets or the black market and then transfer them to try and sell them and with that money they buy Chinese products and take them back to North Korea to sell. It's the process as oldest

Speaker 2:          08:56          self

Speaker 1:          09:00          and here within this world of international trade is where a new class is emerging. Individuals who usually have power or influence or dealings with high officials who were making serious money and by the way that driving a lot of activities that have nothing to do with the old socialist model within Pyongyang itself. The salary for doctors, it was about 3,501 a month. That was less than a cost by one kilogram of rice. So of course being a doctor was not my main job. My main job was smuggling. At night I would send herbal medicine from North Korea into China with the money I would import home appliances back into North Korea. Rice cookers, no tells, LCD monitors, that kind of thing. A doctor who worked at a hospital in high San North Korea is an anecdote today, for example, you can buy coca cola in the streets of Pyongyang and according to the South Korean intelligence service, at least 40 percent of all North Koreans participate in private activities and businesses in some way.

Speaker 1:          09:58          That might be surprising to you, but there's still more here. But before we get into all of that is an important note. We're talking about a very incipient process in North Korea. The government still controls virtually everything. If these black markets are growing, it's because they're being allowed to grow. This is likely because they're more efficient. They work, that's a. They give the government money and they allow North Koreans to find a way to improve their living standards. Something very similar happens in the Soviet Union and in Vietnam and of course in China. So now let's have a look at what else is happening. Reforms made in China, class of merchants and entrepreneurs that is emerging as a name among North Koreans, the Dome Jew, and as you can imagine, many of them, especially those who really make money are people who belong to the Communist Party, ends are well connected in the government

Speaker 1:          10:57          to say they aren't a part of the elite which they take advantage of, not only need to get special treatment from the security forces, but also to reach advantages. Agreements with public companies. There are clear suspicions that many irregular exports are manufactured by public companies, but the benefits go to these elite members. However, this new economic approach isn't something that bothers the Pyongyang. Governments, in fact, everything indicates that the North Korean government wants to reproduce the Chinese model in some way. That is to seek foreign investment that will allow them to grow and develop that without losing political control.

Speaker 2:          11:35          See,

Speaker 1:          11:35          since Kim Jong came to power, his government has granted more freedom to public companies so that they can organize as they wish and to find their own suppliers and customers. It is also promoted, as we've seen private markets. They turned a blind eye to the black markets and families and collective funds now have individual plots assigned to them who's harvest once they meet the state. Criteria can be used as they wish. They can of course then sell it in the private market. North Korea has even started talking about special economic zones, but I must stress here that this is all a very new process.

Speaker 1:          12:08          This doesn't mean this. A radical change is going to happen in the short term. That's due to the official systems in capacity. The North Koreans are developing an alternative to improve their standard of living and even though unfortunately North Korea is still the totalitarian and poor country that it was before Kim Jong Un's arrival. You contemplate that this new kinds of parallel economy's growth is somewhat surprising. That now is your sound. Do you think that North Korea will try to follow the Chinese model?
