Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          Chechnya is an island of Islamic fanaticism in the middle of Vladimir Putin's Russia. Yup. You had that rights when it comes to me, that congratulates itself on being the spiritual shelter of the West. The laws, the bullock of Christiana. See, this is a country where you can find the republic of Chechnya. It's a positive Russia where it is impossible to buy him.

Speaker 1:          00:27          Cut.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Oh yes. Was I know what you're going to see. I'm waiting an assignment that didn't you just say the republic of Chechnya didn't say that it was a part of Russia? Well, the truth is the Russian Federation is territory wise, the biggest country in the world, and that means that their political distribution, it's really complicated. The biggest parts of the country is divided into the so called oblasts switch up. Similar to the states in the United States of America. These areas, they have their own governor. They have their own parliaments, but they must respect the Russian constitution as well as the Kremlin. However, there are other regions in Russia, the so called republics that have way more autonomy. They have their own constitution. They have their own language and they could even have that own official. One of these republics is the Crimean republic and despite not being recognized by America or by Europe, it is controlled by Russia. You've seen in theory, Russian law guarantees a lot of autonomy bots. I say in theory like that because as you know, Vladimir Putin loves to keep this country under tight control. In fact, almost all of the presidents of the republics belonged to Putin's political party and that would be united Russia. Anytime one of those governors challenges Putin, even just the little things like this happen

Speaker 2:          01:47          Tatarstan the last region to lose its special status under Putin. Nonetheless, there is a real public that Putin does not dare to bully. Yup. You had that ride. Vladimir Putin, the Chuck Norris of politics is afraid sometimes to specifically when it comes to Chechnya,

Speaker 1:          02:04          is

Speaker 2:          02:05          often unclear who rules whom. Russian observers of the region complained that Russian law and authority stops at the Chechnyan border. For example, in Chechnya, the hijab is promoted by the government. Things like polygamy and even marriages involving minors that are actually tolerated and no restaurant. Dez to open a daytime during Ramadan season. Nonetheless, all of these things, I'm nothing compared to what some newspapers showed in April of 2017 Chechnya opens worlds first concentration camp for homosexuals. Yeah, yeah. Listen, I know he picked it is not exactly the biggest fan of lgbt rights, but opening a gay concentration camp sounds like it it too much even for him. So the question to be made here is why doesn't put some order into Chechnya? What is the church and President Rams and off secret to getting Putin that's and let him do as he pleases. Well today we are going to answer all of those questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Great.

Speaker 2:          03:17          The Sicily of the Caucasus for centuries Czechian yet was ruled by big clams that have power over specific areas. Those clams named took home in the church in language we're composed of hundreds of smaller families. The so called tip or a better understanding. This was pretty similar to the Sicilian mafia system. Everything stayed in the file. Everything was done according to the principles of religion. In this case, Sunni Islam, I'm the same way. The Sicilian mafia resisted all kinds of invasions. The Chechen took him system that survived the saws and even the Soviet Union.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:57          it must be Soviets in public and Muslims in private Chechnyan proverb and other words during the Soviet era that were two parallel systems that were running at the same time, all of a surface that was communism, but under grounds there was a hierarchy of Muslim clams and families. This is why in the year 1991 when the Soviet Union disappeared, Chechens seize the opportunity and declared the Chechen Republic of a carrier. This, and I might ring a bell with you because it appears in one of the call of duty video games. Now back then, the presidents of the brand new Russian Federation, that was Boris Yeltsin, and he replied to those rebels with military Yeltsin, declares emergency curfew and Chechen region. Nevertheless, this state of emergency fails entirely. The Russian army was incapable of stopping the chapter and rentals and they have to run back home. But not only that, during their retreats, these separatist rebels seized Russian weapons. So for three long years, the Kremlin puts up with Chechnya. But in the year 1994 well, things they changed.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Okay,

Speaker 2:          05:10          you can build a throne with band nets, but it's difficult to sit on it, Boris Yeltsin. But do you remember what I told you about the political system of Chechnya, which was based on the took him clan system? Well, the truth is these different clans didn't really get on very well with each other, and this was the start of a civil war, a civil war. That's to rush eyes. Where's the perfect opportunity to take back control of the republic? However, a year later, the Russian army had lost 6,000 soldiers and poor Boris Yeltsin had to sign a peace treaty with the separatists ends. Pretty weak governments of Chechnya. Meanwhile, many Islamic terrorists from Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan fled to Grozny. The Chechen capitol to recruit new members are failed states with a tribal system where Islam is the official religion. That sounds like a pretty great market for recruiting terrorists.

Speaker 2:          06:02          Well, in other words, all of this meant that it was just a matter of time before another war again. So this war, it started in 1999 when a group of Islamic rebels invaded a neighboring Russian republic, the Republic of Dagestan. So if making trouble in their own territory wasn't enough Chechens wanting to attack other parts of Russia. Now, as you might imagine from this, the Kremlin decided to send the troops immediately, but this time it was pretty different. So why was this? Well, despite the fact Boris Yeltsin was the president this time, the prime minister was the one and only the hero of visual politic. And that would be Vladimir Putin. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:42          Well, Putin, he actually, when's their rents? He found one of the separatists chiefs. And that would be Ms. Dot. [inaudible] cut a Rov. So basically piecing when's this cutter off guy and said, all right dude, look, I'm going to show you a gold. I'm going to give me as many weapons and as much power as you need. You could do whatever you want there in Chechnya, but that is only one condition. No wars, no terrorism. All right. And as we say here at visual policy egg as it was sad, well still it was done. The wall, it was over and catterall views all that help from the Kremlin. Do you destroy it? The other warlords in the report,

Speaker 2:          07:19          and now you might be wondering, well, did all of this work really answer says yes. I'm sort of all say no. Of course there were no more wars, but many of those other warlords started organizing terrorist attacks in other areas of Russia, including Moscow. In the Moscow case, a terrorist group kidnaps over 300 hostages in a theater. Of those 300 civilians, 170 died. In other words, Putin's plan was far from perfect and Kevin Authority was not taken for granted. In fact, some years later he would die in another terrorist attack in Grozny Allen's. Well, that was the moment when the main character in all of this story comes into the picture. Instagram star runs out and catterall succeeded. His Father Empower Nan's. He learned a valuable lesson. If you want to start a dictatorship, you better make it big. We all talking about a country full of warlords fighting each other. Where al You doing one dash are recruiting people who might challenge cataracts power. In other words, he was not willing to let those weird western fashions, you know, like democracy or human rights make him look weak. Besides here, pten support. He had wealth. He had weapons. What marketing possibly ask

Speaker 1:          08:35          form.

Speaker 2:          08:38          I owe my life to preach him. If I ever forget this, I am not a math. When I went through a terribly hard time in my life, he helped. He has the most saintly to Ramazan

Speaker 1:          08:48          [inaudible]. The truth. Truth

Speaker 2:          08:52          is since kind of rope came to power Chechen in other parts of Russia, while they've disappeared, but not only that, I'll, how are you doing Dash Mila's in stuff disappearing to cater rob's police chases them. Expels them from the country with their families and then bud's down the houses.

Speaker 3:          09:10          Yes,

Speaker 2:          09:12          this was not enough. Cut Her off. Soldiers offer themselves as volunteers for the most dangerous missions in Ukraine. In fact, in order to show his love for Putin rams and candor of organize the military parade at Cross knee football stadium, thousands of soldiers were waving at the Chechen presidents ready to die for him. If Putin tells me to get my army together, I'm ready. [inaudible] rough bus things. Well, they are not as sweet as they might seem. Actually with that military parade cadre off was given two messages. One was, Hey Putin, I'm your buddy, but the other was, hey Putin, if you ever stopped being my buddy, come and get me, if you dare. Yes, DIV UA. If flattening a Putin ever wanted to confront his Chechen bestie, it would be complicated to save the League

Speaker 2:          10:02          spent on many signs that this could actually happen. In fact, all of Kadar, rob's political foes, they've been murdered regardless of where they work. For journalists living in Moscow to political opponents, siding in some Petersburg, they've all been kills like, well, what does this mean? What it means. The government of Grozny has its own kgb situated all across the country and well they're happy to use it anytime someone Chechen or not get seen little bits bothersome so it puts it more poetically well piecing created rams and cat are off and now his creation has become big enough to look him in the eye. This explains why I'm like other presidents of Russian republics kind of relevant dares to give his opinion on international affairs and the creme and they pretended they don't see those horrific gay concentration camps.

Speaker 3:          10:52          Russia

Speaker 2:          10:53          backs, Chechnya governments, denials over killing a torture of gay men. Meanwhile, Chechnya is getting wealthier and wealthier thanks to Russia. 90% of their wealth comes direct from money transfers from the Kremlin her off. He's built a republic where the cause of his personality is always like a second religion. Just surpassed by Islam is instagram accounts, by the way, has over 3 million followers, which is twice as many as the church and population. And on this account you can see the lifestyle of one of the craziest dictators around, and at the same time, the only one that makes pewter to phrase.

Speaker 2:          11:34          Now the question is, will Vladimir Putin and ran Zahn catterall ends up clashing? Should the Kremlin tried to stop the human rights violations in Chechnya?
