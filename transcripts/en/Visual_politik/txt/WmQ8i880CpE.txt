Speaker 1:          00:07          Bolivia, Chile, all the fifty cents and Kanye west of Latin America. Now it is true, they share a border, but other than that they couldn't be more different. So Olivia is one of the poorest countries on the whole continents. While Chile is among the wealthiest Bolivia is a paragon of these so called indigenous socialism. While Chile is known as the mod or of Neo liberalism, and as if this was not enough, the two countries are involved in seemingly never ending territorial disputes with each other nonetheless. Now that is one thing that these two countries have in common. Yes. If you are, we are talking about a white gold.

Speaker 2:          00:45          God Damn.

Speaker 1:          00:50          No, no, no, no. That type of white gold. I'm talking here about lithium. Lithium is used for the manufacturing of batteries that power your cell phone, your laptop, and those electric cars. This eventually you might flood our roads and highways, the coat, the new oil.

Speaker 3:          01:04          If the latest metal on the periodic table, it's value has gone up tenfold in the last two decades alone and it's demand won't stop growing between 60 and 80 percent of the world's known reserves are in an area called the lithium triangle. This is an area that covers parts of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. In these countries, lithium is abundant and easy to extract. In other words, this part of the planet might soon become a new Saudi Arabia

Speaker 1:          01:32          forum that it's found in, is found in these dried up salt lake's solars, so Brian's, which is very different than getting lithium out of hard rock. It's a much cheaper, much more effective among those three countries. Bolivia is the luckiest one. The so called salons. A Uni holds two or three times more lithium reserves than the mines in Argentina or in Chile. Now, on the other hand, the Chili already has a world class mining industry. However, despite these reserves, Bolivia is exporting less lithium than the other two countries, and shelley might actually soon be out of this new white gold rush. In fact, Argentina is the nation that is getting the most attention from international investors, so today's question has to be what's going on in Bolivia? Why is no one exploiting? Then lithium resources and why is Chili following six today? We're going to answer all of those questions, but before we do, let's take a look at the history

Speaker 3:          02:26          new Potosi.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Now, if you've been subscribed to visual policy for a while, you already know that having natural resources doesn't mean that you are rich, but if he is an excellent example of

Speaker 2:          02:36          yes,

Speaker 1:          02:40          the country has all the natural wealth, you can imagine lithium Silva natural gas. Nevertheless, it is still one of the poorest countries in all of South America.

Speaker 3:          02:49          The silver mines of Potosi, where the state of war for the Spanish crown during the 16th and 17th centuries

Speaker 2:          02:58          backed

Speaker 3:          02:58          Spaniard still say

Speaker 1:          03:00          this is worth a potosi, meaning that something is too expensive, but the native Bolivians didn't reap the benefits of that silver wealth and millions died under the stream working conditions in the mines. This is why it's pretty understandable that the governments of Evo Morales says is so reluctant to allow foreign companies to get into the country and extract the liquid.

Speaker 2:          03:18          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:22          let's Let. Let's be honest, the real business here is not the raw materials, Bart in the industry that comes afterwards for a better understanding of this. Why don't we make this video a metric ton of lithium costs around $9,000 on the international market, but if we take that raw lithium, then we turn it into batteries for mobile phones, we can turn that lithium into a value of somewhere between one point five and $5,000,000. Of course, this is just a rough estimate of value and there are lots of things that should be considered here, but it can help to look into comparison. Indeed it can help explain it and use this.

Speaker 3:          03:55          Plus he take Abel Morales Morales opened in 2013 the first plant of lithium carbonate and in February 2014 limit the first manufacturing facility for lithium ion batteries,

Speaker 1:          04:07          but that is not all in Bolivia. Lithium is nationalized. This means that if you are a private mining company and you want to work on Canadian soil, you must partner with the government and start a new company which will be owned partly by the governments. This new company can get paid for their service and building the mind, setting up the machinery and extracting the lithium. The lithium, they extract well that belongs to the government. They have no rights to it. What do you wondering? Why does Bolivia need foreign companies to exploit that wealth? They simply do it themselves. Well, the short answer is no. Modern Day mining, it has nothing to do with the image you probably have in your mind's going with a hardhat on they pick axe. Today. Mining requires high ends machinery and world class engineers. As you can imagine, these things are scarce in a country is poor, has been,

Speaker 2:          04:58          yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:02          Create a competitive mining industry in that country without outside help. You would need decades. This is why it is so important to utilize companies who have the technology, the tools, and the staff to do the job. And this is why even Moralez himself friendly to multinationals have said that it's time to get out there and find investors,

Speaker 3:          05:22          elemental getting used. We have a big lithium industry, Bolivia. We'll set the lithium price for the whole world. I want you to say to you governments and private companies now you can join us.

Speaker 2:          05:42          So.

Speaker 1:          05:42          Alright, so what exactly is the problem here? Well, as we said before, Bolivian lithium is owned by the state. This means that companies that might invest in the country can only get to profit by partnering with the governments and from that profit, a famous pay, a special mining tax that goes up to 37 point five percent, which is by far the largest in the region. And if all of this wasn't enough, well, according to the world's bank, Bolivia ranks among the 50 countries where it is hardest to do business, they rank at about the same level as Sierra Leone. So now let's say that you're someone who wants to invest in lithium. Do you fancy investing in Bolivia or maybe you might prefer one of those other countries. You know, maybe this explains why the moments Bolivia Wallace is the country with the biggest lithium resources. It is also the country that is exploiting them. The least. If you pay attention to the chart, you will see that today, the leader of the lithium race is awesome, surprising because the resources of this country off four times smaller than those of Bolivia Fonts, Australian salaries are six times higher than Bolivian ones. So as you can see, this is not a matter of low pay jobs on natural wealth, but simply good and bad economic policies. But hold on just a minute because this is not the only problem. Don't forget that Evo Morales dream is for Bolivia to become a manufacturing leader in the lithium battery industry. But I mean how exactly is he going to achieve this without foreign companies setting up insight.

Speaker 1:          07:17          Alright, so yeah, the government can set up its own factory and that's all great and everything, but technology patents and the skills needed that held by companies like Panasonic. Samsung will tesla without these Bolivia, would need decades of research in order to be competitive on the international markets. Alright, so a while ago we mentioned Chili. Now let's go over and have a look at what's happening over there.

Speaker 3:          07:43          Chalet follows in the steps of Bolivia.

Speaker 1:          07:45          For years, Jenny has been known as something of a free market, Disneyland or precisely they're mining industry was one of the freest in the entire world. We're talking about the country, whether your comedy relies heavily on copper mining. This is why you have, again 1981 Pinochet's dictatorship past these so called mining law. This allowed private businesses to own 100 percent. As you can imagine, this little kickstarted foreign investments in the country. Suddenly lots of companies like the Australian Bhp Billiton or the Swiss xstrata came to Chile. Yeah, listen, I know what you're thinking. All these multinational companies while they looted to the country and left it in poverty, rice, right? Well actually that's

Speaker 3:          08:28          really wrong. Of course these Canadian, Swiss and Australian companies came to extract the cop,

Speaker 2:          08:33          right.

Speaker 3:          08:37          Also helped to finance lots of brand new companies which employ Chilean workers and we're headquartered in Santiago, companies like Manera Escondida or Antofagasta mining.

Speaker 1:          08:47          In fact, thanks to this wave of investors, Chili now has any world class mining industry, actually many of the engineers that are now needed in Bolivia, they live in the best neighborhoods of Santiago and this means that one has been in a great position to lead this point. Gold Rush. Nonetheless, in 2016 Chilean presidents, Michelle Backlash declared that the lithium was a different animal

Speaker 1:          09:13          from the strategic condition of lithium, which is property of all Chilean people and we'll keep it state as nonconcessional material. In other words, the governments of Chiney is following suit with Bolivia barter. They do have an important difference in this case. The country already has the technology and the staff to exploit its mineral wealth in an efficient way. Of course, many of these companies who were willing to invest in the country have lost all interest, but surely has its own companies, so it's not so big a deal besides until 2014. The other countries have this lithium triangle in Argentina, in Bolivia, well way worse places for investments, so in this case is sort of like in the land of the blind, the one eyed passing is king. Well, they entail now Argentina has been the big surprise here while Chile and Bolivia have nationalized the lithium and have tried badly to scare away foreign companies. Argentina with Mauricio Macri as its president is doing something rather different and the now getting all the attention from international

Speaker 2:          10:15          investors.

Speaker 1:          10:19          We're actually going to talk about that in upcoming weeks in a sort of second part to this video. So if you don't want to miss that, please do be sure to subscribe to this channel. In the meantime, we've got a question for you. Do you think that Bolivia, Chile can reap the benefits of their lithium with these kinds of policies or maybe Argentina will somehow overshadow them? You can leave me in the comment section below and just before we go today, I've got a really important question and sort of a request from you. You might've noticed that we'd rather like using rock music in our videos and we'd love to hear from anyone who has a bands and things that Ben Music could be a good fit for us.
