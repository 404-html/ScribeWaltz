Speaker 1:          00:08          In the next few decades, the wells as we know it, will change the loss. This will of course bring many opportunities, but also many challenges more precisely. Most of developed countries are facing such a large threats that that response may determine in economic, political, and social times which countries succeed and which fail. Folks, I'm talking about population aging of the demographic pyramids. One hundred and 80 degree turn. Yeah. I'm sure this isn't news to you. Most of you have probably already heard about this subject. However, have you stopped to think about the processes, consequences on your government's doing something about it? Have they come up with something like a contingency plan so you face the risks that lie ahead? I'll listen up world facing a new state

Speaker 1:          01:06          about a hundred years. Our world has changed a lot. It has changed so much that if we got a time machines, they some sort of special delorean and traveled back two or three centuries for a season sooner rather than later. Most of us, if not all of us, would want to go back home really, really fast. We'd be missing loads of things. Would be horrified by the day to day, we'd be forced to work intensely harder just to survive and we'd be afraid of getting sick because we might die and we might not even be able to eat. But let's stay on topic. Here it is. At the end of the 19th century, the world's population surpass the one point 5 billion person.

Speaker 2:          01:46          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:49          I mean, 100 years later during the 20th century, the world's population has multiplied by four and past 6 billion of course, considering the enormous speed with which the world population group, we can't be surprised by the fact that many experts began to worry about of the population and do you not think that this was just a thing among mediocre expert scientists and politicians? Nineteen 74, a report by the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon's government to consider birth control in countries such as Brazil, India, Mexico, Columbia, Ethiopia, and Thailand as a top priority.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Cool.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Coming to the report, the demographic explosion that was taking place posed a serious threat to the security of the United States.

Speaker 2:          02:38          Yeah. With

Speaker 1:          02:41          so many people consuming resources, Kissinger thought we were heading towards a world of scarcity and fear struggles for resources. Have you noticed how Malthusian arguments come up again and again, even though they never actually happened? The fact is that while guys like Kissinger try to think about how to control the world's population and influence their decisions to change was already taking place. Such a huge change that it would turn an entirely new points in the debate. In the last 50 years. Welds fertility has halved so much so that nowadays Western governments no longer think about overpopulation, but rather about aging today, European countries and even the United States tend to lose native inhabitants. Check this out. In Germany, for example, since 1972, there have been 5 million more deaths than births. However, the most extreme case has been that of Russia were in just 20 years. Between 1991 and 2011. Then we're at 13 point one, three more deaths than there were births. Future projections show that in the next 50 years, Europe's native population will decrease fire rounds. One hundred million people.

Speaker 2:          03:58          No,

Speaker 1:          03:59          just that the other effect of this entire process is that the world's population, especially if out of the most developed countries is aging at full speed and that my friends, it's posing many, many challenges, pensions, healthcare expenses, dependence, and the question is now, how on earth can we finance this gigantic expense to give you an idea of what we're talking about here is estimated that in many European countries, the percentage of the population over 65 years old will be around 40 percent by 2050 and one of those most effected countries is actually Spain. So listen up country of retired people. Here's an exercise for you. Let's assume that fertility in Spain and the European Union remains within the rates that they've had since the year 2000 and that's in addition. No immigrants arrive. You want to know what's going to happen? Well, check out the following week,

Speaker 2:          04:54          Ralph

Speaker 1:          04:57          and see if the population aged between 18 and 40 years, which is the population that works the most and the population that has the most children. That's going to take a huge dip. Of course, the number of inhabitants, just a decade later that followed the same trap. Spain is one of the countries that's beginning to suffer the most from this demographic crisis. The demographic crisis is getting worse. Spain suffers it's biggest population loss in 2017. If we take a look at the average number of children per women, we can truly understand what was going on here and this is taking into account that the arrival of immigrants in the last 20 years has boosted birthrates. Nowadays, 23 percent of all children born in Spain, almost one in four have a foreign

Speaker 2:          05:50          mother fucker boss.

Speaker 1:          05:57          The most important data to predict what's going to happen will come from looking at how the number of people of working age will evolve. They after all other ones who generate the vast majority of resources, both public and private. Well, if we assume that there's no immigration in just 30 years, the working age population would decrease by 10 million people. It's according to the projections of the Institute of Statistics of the government of Spain. Spaniards will face this panorama by 2015.

Speaker 2:          06:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:26          30 million people of working age, all of whom, of course not a world work and almost 22 million children and retirees. That is the dependent population would be greater than the working age population. Yeah. Now we're talking about Spain specifically here, but this scenario is very familiar to most developed countries. As you can imagine, all of this has many consequences. The consequences in recent times there's been a lot of talk about the risk of automation, but perhaps the most imminent risk that developed countries have to face is that quick aging process.

Speaker 1:          07:12          At the end of the day, it's clear that an agent population has several consequences. For one, it's foreseeable that if nothing changes, public spending will skyrockets to pay pensions, healthcare expenses assistance, and Kathy, the elderly, among many other things. Pension spending increases by 50 percent in Spain in 10 years, and no doubt, this will be very clear as a politician and sleep hygiene, many have retired voters will be overwhelming. It's simply a matter of votes, but at the same time as we've seen, there are going to be off. You are working age people, so the question is how on earth are we going to pay for this huge expense? Will the already high taxes be raised even further damaging the competitiveness of countries with as many economic problems as Spain or perhaps Italy? Well, the reality is that's a recipe that just doesn't work. Now at this point, I think we need to answer a mandatory question. Well, what the hell can we do? We need a plan.

Speaker 3:          08:16          I know

Speaker 1:          08:18          and politicians don't usually like to think about the future. Especially future problems probably goes a little something like this. What I need to think about problems that will happen in 20 years from now when the risk losing votes. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let someone else take care of that. Well, if we don't want to see headlines like this developed, countries are going to need a plan. Japan's finance minister tells elderly they should hurry up and die to help reduce countries rising. Welfare bill. The time to make decisions is now in countries that decide to look the other way and do nothing will face many, many problems in the future. You see lately here on visual politic, we've talked a lot about immigration. While experience tells us that this is a good way to stop population aging and buy time to make new reform.

Speaker 4:          09:08          As Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore have shown integration can soften the blow from rapid aging. Sean Young Rhee, director of Asia Pacific Department at the International Monetary Fund.

Speaker 1:          09:19          Yes. Despite many politicians discourse, the truth is that developed countries will need many people to arrive from abroad, so folks, instead of thinking about building walls and closing borders, it would be much more advisable to start a system that manages to attract people from outside in an orderly fashion and facilitates the integration, but of course that's not all as public pension systems will almost certainly become much less generous because they won't have as much of a budget. Governments should also be promoting saving both from the governments themselves and from families.

Speaker 4:          09:57          Any Spanish political party warning citizens of the next cut in their pensions. No, they're all silent about our true future, giving a false impression that one doesn't need to save to guarantee a fairly dignified retirement. Quander, I'm on an IO economist and director of the one day Marianna Institute,

Speaker 1:          10:15          and along with all of this, of course governments should promote policies that attract companies that promote entrepreneurship and the bubble that favor productivity investments in machines and technology and in research and developments. Yes, I think robots are actually going to greatly help with this problem. Unfortunately, in many of the affected countries, including Spain, nothing has been done. And finally before we finish, I'd like to throw out an idea. See, the effects of aging is accompanied by a longevity effects. I want me to explain this. Thanks to medical advances that nutrition into quality of life mortality rates for all ages, so have decreased that his people a younger for long see in the United States. For example, the 75 year old person has the same mortality rate today as a 65 year old person had in the 19 fifties in Japan. 80 is the new 65

Speaker 1:          11:12          and also thanks to medical and technological advances, this evolution, it continues to grow and grow, which the humanity is fantastic. Therefore, if people have a longer, more productive life, wouldn't it be wise to encourage them to continue working for longer and you've even partially or in more comfortable roles and that's where I'm going to leave today's video, but now it's your turn.
