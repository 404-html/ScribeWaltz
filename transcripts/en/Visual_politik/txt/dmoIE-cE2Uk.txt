Speaker 1:          00:00          Donald trump's unexpected presidential. When the rejection of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC, the surprise Brexit victory folks 2016 what was the uh, in which forecasts fails? And it was precisely then there's an ever present and very important question. Rose. Once again, all surveys useful ver anything and to what extent can we trust these surveys?

Speaker 2:          00:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34          In a world where information is readily available, everywhere and changes are happening at a dizzying pace, pulse have become a political and commercial weapon, whether it's to gain votes or to sell products. Getting to new voters or customer's tastes, preferences and concerns is usually highly recommended. I believe me. Wow. Check this out.

Speaker 1:          00:57          John F. Kennedy was the first White House candidate who used and relied on poles to prepare his campaign strategy. Kennedy's team systematically used surveys to discovering and analyze voters opinions and concerns in such a way that they'd be able to adapt to the future president's political discourse do these very issues. Very example, one of the surveys with which the Kennedy team works revealed that only 30% of families could send their children to university. But that 80% of families still dreamed of being able to do that someday. Sorry, can you guess what Kennedy did off the last? Well, yes. He insisted in his features a gain in the game that education was a priority for him and that he would improve trading opportunities for every family's children while the public, they responded to this message, well,

Speaker 3:          01:42          if we're going to absorb the new technology, we're going to have the have the path train people in the world and they're going to come out of this state and the other 49 states

Speaker 1:          01:51          that was an old, as you probably know, John F. Kennedy was Catholic and this wasn't very well received and the Protestant regions, which is why many Protestant voters weren't willing to vote for him. Well, the Kennedy team decided to use the polls to decide which states the candidate would visit during the presidential campaign. That way they left out new less than 30 states, many of them precisely because of the voters reluctance to vote for a Catholic Candida's. Thus the Kennedy campaigns in was able to concentrate all of its efforts on the states where they had a shot. As you definitely know, Kennedy became president. As you can see, polls I powerful weapon for drawing political and business strategies. That's why since Kennedy, the vast majority of politicians have had a great fondness for surveys and demographic studies because well, knowledge is power and not only that, the polls have also acquired another ability, the ability to influence the decision making process. That is polls can actually gain votes or clients by themselves, whether by useful voting, compromising, coattail effect of voting. It doesn't really matter. Usually when a survey says that something is in high demand, it's natural demand tends to grow even though it may never reach the savvis levels. It's exactly due to this effect. There's Paula stations and many companies are so addicted to continuously making surveys of all kinds. However, surveys on not always conducted as they should be, and that has led to some occasional very huge mistakes.

Speaker 2:          03:26          I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. The big mistakes

Speaker 1:          03:38          the years political polls have left behind a huge trail of flaws and mistakes of truly galactic proportions. Perhaps one of the best known happens in 1936 you think presidential elections were being held in the United States that year and the magazine Literary Digest, which was one of the most important in the world at the time, carried out a macro survey was one of the largest and most expensive surveys of all time. The sample included almost two and a half million people.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Cool

Speaker 1:          04:07          with Artesia in hand. The magazine determines that without a doubt, Alfred Landon, the Republican governor of Kansas, would become the next president of the United States. He would defeat the Democrats, Franklin Roosevelt, by more than the 14 points. This is what the survey stated, but as you all know the truth, it was quite different. Roosevelt's utterly destroyed his rival, beating him by more than 24 points, and of course he became the new tenant of the White House. Since that invokes the Saturdays of the magazine, literary digest are considered absolute nonsense. They're known to be demographic studies that are full of errors and plenty of bias. The reality is that this magazine surveys should have been used as a manual on how not to conduct surveys, but don't think that this was the only resoundingly mistake, not at all. In fact, history is littered with examples.

Speaker 1:          05:00          The 1948 campaign because it Harry Truman, Franklin Roosevelt success, they against the Republican New York State Governor Thomas Dewey, he'd become tremendously popular for his prosecution of organized crime, specifically for his wall with the caper lucky Luciano. The fact is that Thomas Dewey was the big favorite to win the elections. All the polls presented him as the clear winner and even some newspapers jumped ahead to calling him president dewey. The difference between both candidates seemed so great so that one of the country's leading a survey experts, elmo roper said that he wasn't going to do any more poles or any surveys or anything like that. It just wasn't worth speculating on something so incredibly obvious. Dewey, he would absolutely be the president.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Well, once again, history is how I dealt rather differently. Dreaming won the election. By more than 2 million votes. Have a look at this picture. It shows the United States President Harry Truman with a copy of the first edition of the Chicago daily whose headline reads dewey defeats Truman. Yup. The journalist's thought it was such a safe choice that they prepared the news before the vote had even taken place. And at this point we'd like you to imagine that newspaper editors face, but just a second because these big mistakes, they don't exclusively come from the u s for example, there are the British elections of 1992 all polls showed a clear victory for the Labour party. Undoubtedly often 13 years in power. At the time of the conservatives, it was coming to an end. But once again, the reality was quite different. And the conservative John Major, he took over 10 Downing Street. So check out the huge difference here between theory and reality. The fact is that we could spend a lot of time commenting on all the macro mistakes that surveys have made. But let's go back to our initial question. Having seen all of this, can we trust polls?

Speaker 1:          07:04          Can we trust polls? So now we've seen some of the biggest mistakes that surveys have made in our history. However, the field has evolved a lot. And the truth is that it's pretty efficient. I mean it works. A study conducted by professors from the University of Southampton and the University of Texas analyzed more than 30,000 surveys for 351 general elections in 45 different countries between 1942 and 2017 study. The authors compared what the survey said with what actually happens. Well, based on the results in is a question. Do you know what percentage of the more than 30,000 surveys analyzed had a failure higher than their margin of error? 20% 30% no, it was 2% only 2% of all surveys. And in addition, the results showed that accuracy has improved as the years have gone by.

Speaker 2:          08:01          Bye.

Speaker 1:          08:04          But yeah, I know Donald Trump's victory against what the polls prophesized was for many irrefutable proof that polls, hi, useless. For example, the Princeton consortium gave Hillary Clinton and a 99% chance of winning the New York Times where it's a bit more cautious setting the probability at 85% maybe all of these things explain why according to polls, ironic I know only at 26% of likely us voters, that's one in four trust, most political polls and of course taking what happened in the last presidential campaign into accounts. They seem to have good reason to do so. Right, but hold on a moment because did the surveys rarely fail that badly in 2016 while the answer may differ a bit from what we first saw?

Speaker 2:          08:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Yeah, it is true. The elections were won by the candidate at the polls. Determined would be the loser and it's precisely due to this fact. There's many experts are studying what went wrong and many theories have been put forward. For example, what if trump's voters tend to have to answer fewer surveys? What if the response rate is very low ends? In the end, those who answer are accounted for. What if the probability of correlated errors wasn't played out well, et Cetera, et Cetera, ans yes, some of these matters will pollute the results, but to hold on a second, if we take a look at the results that the surveys had estimated that actually weren't that many mistakes, you see, the polls predicted that Hillary would win the popular vote by about three points and in fact, Hillary won the popular vote by more than two points, but as you will know, the candidate with the most rights doesn't always win elections in the u s the one who gets the most state delegates does.

Speaker 1:          09:40          It was right at this point when determining which state each candidate would win in the error in forecasting the winner was caused anyway. As you can see, the mistake, it wasn't that huge and that's taking into account that electoral polls are particularly difficult, perhaps the most difficult, not only because we need to determine the favorite candidates, but also how many of the people interviewed will eventually vote and how they'll vote on that precise day. The truth folks is that surveys are very accurate when it comes to determining what the general perception of a particular issue or subject is and fast why they're so important for both politicians and for companies, they may include a few mistakes. In fact, survey results come with a margin of error include included, but as we've seen, the evidence tells us that the real result in the vast majority of cases is usually within that margin of error.

Speaker 1:          10:28          And also that's not, forget how important trends are. For example, it's like a thermometer and ground via Madrid, which says 600 degrees Fahrenheit. It's wrong, but if you walk by tomorrow and it says 650 degrees Fahrenheit, you know one thing, it's hotter than yesterday, Pablo Seaman Politiken but now it's your turn. Do you trust the polls?
