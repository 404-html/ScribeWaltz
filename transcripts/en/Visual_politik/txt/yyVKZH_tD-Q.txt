Speaker 1:          00:00          Devi was Argentina is not exactly having its best moments.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Mauricio Macri has, government has had to ask for a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. And the truth is this, in the last few decades, crises, devaluations, inflation and payment suspensions has become commonplace in Argentina as politics and the economy. Well, throughout this entire process, one political movement has had an absolute influence. Perrona isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:43          All right.

Speaker 1:          00:50          What exactly is this political stream known as Peronas and how did it come about and what impact has it really has on Argentina? Well, we're going to talk about it all on visual politic in two videos and in the first one we're going to focus on its origins and its identity. So listen up.

Speaker 3:          01:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15          First of all, who was Kwan Domingo, Peron, and most importantly, how did he manage to gain power and influence in Argentine politics for seven decades? Well, it's the beginning of this story. We have to go all the way back to the 1930s that time Argentine nationalism was in its golden age, Argentina. It was undoubtedly Latin America's great power, just like the 1929 crisis. It was still one of the 10 richest countries in the world and wages were much, much higher than in Europe. How has the way to second tier, because in spite of this, the 1929 crisis had taken its toll hitting the country hard. The tension led to the first military coup in 1930 [inaudible] support is by many political, economic and social sectors, especially on the conservative side of things. This militaristic authoritarians nationalists, Panorama, it's became customer ether. Many officers of the origin time, Amit did, he sent to Germany and Italy to take advanced courses. Debbie, what do you know who one of these officers was? Well, yeah, that would be Juan Domingo Peron who was sent to you. It's a a country where he met and studied firsthand how Benito Miscellaneous governments was organized and you know what? Soon after he'd get the chance to put this knowledge right into practice,

Speaker 1:          02:53          you see as the beginning of the 1940s Argentina was under the control of a corrupt and authoritarians governments and governments that had perpetuated electoral fraud and attempted to stay in power at all costs under these circumstances. On June the fourth of 1943 a group of young officers in the Argentine army held a coup to tar supposedly to restore a transparent electoral system. One of these offices was our protagonist, leftenant Colonel Hon Domingo Peron. Yeah. By the way, this was Argentina's second cue to tar off to the 1930s one but don't think it was. It's lost. Certainly not the case. During the next 30 years. The country has suffered for more keys. The case is dear viewers that it was this 1943 q which opens the doors to politics and power for lefthand and Colonel [inaudible] Domingo Peron. We can practically see that this is where Argentina's modern history began. So listen up

Speaker 1:          04:12          two and a half years that the military government lasted Paranas Korea was meteoric. This was despite the fact that until then had held a very low rank positions such as head of the Department of Labor, a position that in principle was mad. Do I say it's rather bureaucratic? However, hold on a second because thanks to his political intelligence product managed. You can use this position as a springboard for his rise to power. You see it from the very beginning, quantum and go [inaudible] and used everything had learned on the Benito Mussolini in Italy starting by winning some of the unions support that way each time the labor department's had to intervene in a conflict between employers and unions related to [inaudible], the former. The employers would almost always lose. As you can imagine, this meant that this man's popularity didn't stop grabbing.

Speaker 3:          05:02          In fact,

Speaker 1:          05:02          shortly after I put on was appointed minister of war and then vice presidents, or without forgetting the labor policies and the unions, because if something was very, very clear to this leftenant colonel, it was that that would be as political springboard.

Speaker 1:          05:22          He wasn't the only one aspiring to power and so much prominence led to a lot of jealousy. So much so that the military leaders asked him to move away from the governments in 1945 so we could perhaps expect this to be the ends of this military man's political career. Rice. Well, no, nothing could be further from the truth on had learned how much influence the media could have in Europe. So he asked his superiors if he could say goodbye through the national radio network. They naively accepted in Parana, took full advantage of this opportunity in his farewell. She thinks the working passes for that support and the questions, the continuity of the social benefits that had removed.

Speaker 4:          06:09          Paul, Hey Paul, bobby,

Speaker 3:          06:30          hello.

Speaker 1:          06:37          It has a huge effect. In the following days, the unions mobilized in his favor. Ends on October the 17th thousands of workers occupied the plaza de Mayo, the nerve center of Argentine politics, the government disorientated. By the way, events unfolded, asked for you. Leftenant colonel himself to appease the masses and this is something he did, but only after agreeing that he'd be a candidate in the next elections. He also made sure that he had the support of the public powers. Why does it make you, it person has managed to become a candidate, but now he needed to win the election. We've seen at the time Argentina was under military control, so governments authorization was required to hold meetings and electoral act when no accident.

Speaker 3:          07:39          Sure.

Speaker 1:          07:42          Goals per ron's campaign actions were almost automatically authorized. Well, his opponent swelled for, let's just say the process was much slower and not only that, but Peran also had complete access to the most important means of communication at the time the national radio station because it was owned by the government, not old man zipper on his insistence that government's approved paid vacations for all workers as well as additional salary at the end of the year. These are all things that make you look very good to your electorate and it was still a move. This genius of political strategies an interest to use very well.

Speaker 3:          08:23          See,

Speaker 1:          08:23          the State Department of the United States itself intervenes in bronze rivals, campaigns publishing gay reports known as the Blue Book, well put on his activities and those of his military allies were shown to support the Nazi regime. However, brawn managed to turn this around since morphed into something like a struggle between himself who represented Argentines sovereignty in the United States. In the end is all these tactics copied to years later by populist governments throughout Latin America won the elections for per on the victory. It wasn't overwhelming, but it was enough. Very important factor. When Kwanza Mingo Peron came to governments. Argentina was one of the 10 most prosperous and richest economies in the wells. The country. It was even an international credits are countries like the United Kingdom actually owed him money. Thanks to all of this. The new president's had more than enough resources to launch his political program. A program based on three pillars, political sovereignty, economic independence, and social justice. In practice, he transforms Argentina into a kind of army under the command of a single leader. It's president, they'll spur on, managed him, nationalize a lot of companies, especially those related to public services such as transport, energy and communications. He also plays to banking under governmental control into proved a lot of foreign trade restriction

Speaker 1:          09:59          and he also achieved a lot of popular support. So how did he do it? Well, he did it by maintaining utility rates even below that cost and hiring a lot of employees for the governments. And for governmental companies, and it's certainly not so much of a coincidence that the coach and has 60 years later, I did practically the same thing. Of course, all of this involved a lot of spending and well, how do you think he financed it? Of course he started printing your money and this is where the addiction of Argentinian politicians printing bills came from. The fact is that during the first years of this entire process, and thanks to all the money that he injected into the economy, things seemed to be actually sealing pretty smoothly. So what was the problem? Well, it simply wasn't sustainable. The government over spends and the country's competitiveness began to sink like the titanic. Within a few years, they're positive balance, vanished. Private investment collapsed. And so suddenly at some prices started to skyrocket.

Speaker 3:          11:00          Yes.

Speaker 1:          11:03          So what do you think happened then? Do you think that given that his revolution didn't seem to be on the right track, per on foot, take a bit of the blame? Well, no, he didn't at all. In fact, he blamed alleged speculators of attacking the national economy and to remedy all of this, he multiplies the government, controls regulated prices and implemented all kinds of measures that would even affect red distribution. The crisis wasn't Peron's only problem. The 1853 constitution didn't allow for a politician to stay in power preventing an immediate reelection. So under this scenario, what do you think he did? Well, listen to this. Along with the bill printing machine, Latin American politicians. Second toy is constituents, reforms, bands. Of course, Bron was no exception in 1949 since the previous constitution imposed to too many obstacles to on launched a complete constitutional reform. The new constitution placed the state is the fundamental pillar of Argentinian society. Even in the constitution's own preamble, the three pillars of Juan Domingo Peron is political thesis were included. This, we're supposed to be a constitution for all, but let's take a look at the changes result.

Speaker 5:          12:23          It's

Speaker 1:          12:25          investments or disappeared. The macro data just got worse. The country was in crisis and it's public companies in Argentina underwent swats the Dvsa, the Venezuelan state owned oil and natural gas company underwent, they simply weren't invested in, so they suffered from all kinds of influences and in the end they were very unproductive and inefficient all to the detriment of the origin time. Well, it's the new model. Domingo Peron, the Dimsum, it became a poverty making machine. Of course, this all happens under the enormous cults of this leader. The reality to viewers, the Argentine society was in crisis and it was so fragmented. There's under these circumstances, in September of 1955 there was a new coo to top. This time it was against quantum domingo.

Speaker 6:          13:16          You got it? Okay. No, look, Moses Ninguna readiness spending [inaudible] [inaudible]. It's the same time you want to get pixels.

Speaker 1:          13:52          Zane, I might be thinking, well, this is the ends of for wrong. Well, if you think in that your actually mistaken budget.
