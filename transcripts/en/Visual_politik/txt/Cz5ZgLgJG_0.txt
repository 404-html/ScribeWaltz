Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          Spain is known as who? Your Iglesias, this country, the land of the Flamenco and high unemployment rates. Even now when all of Europe is emerging from the crisis, this country maintains a higher unemployment rate than Iraq or Albania. In other words, Spain isn't exactly a role model as far as economics is consent. However, there's a region that doesn't fit at all in this category. Yes, Divya, we all talking about the basket country, also known as a use Katie along with Nevada. These are two of the richest stands, most prosperous regions in the entire of Spain, both of the Basque country and the Vara usually at the top of every indicator, far above, by the way, Catalonia. In other words, we could say that these two regions are something like a small Germany within Spain with an entirely different political systems to the rest of the country as a business sector, more typical of northern Europe than southern Europe.

Speaker 2:          01:10          Moreover, this area has it's own language. This is called a will scatter. Unlike castle on a hill scatter sounds nothing like casper and, but that is not all like a catalonia. The Basque country. Also has an important separatist movement. In fact, 10 years before castle and politicians began to demand independence, the basket governments had also tried to become a sovereign state. This was known as the [inaudible] j plan. See the then president of the basket country borders is officially called to the basket of [inaudible] Juan Jose about [inaudible] tried to divorce from Spain and they went pretty badly. Most of that is something we are going to address in a whole of the video.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Sorry,

Speaker 2:          01:51          let's get onto today's question and that's why is the best country and Novari richer than the rest of Spain? Why do we say that they have a different political systems the rest of the country? Well, we are going to answer all of those questions today, but before we do, let's dive into the history. We'll heritage both regions. The Basque Country End Avara have a special status called the Basque economic agreements. Any people think that this special status came from the Middle Ages, but the truth is that it did see in the year 1200 the ancient kingdom of Novari what are now known as the are larva is Kaia and geepers Korea provinces and Nevara itself joins the castiel crown as a condition for this union. The castilian king had to recognize these circles and never reason Queiroz or laws.

Speaker 2:          02:41          That is to say that this kingdom would maintain an independent government with its own laws, its own courts, and did sent taxes. For example, no Novaris citizen could be forced to do military service. These novaris laws remained practically unchanged for centuries, but don't think that this is an anomaly. Every feudal law absolutest political system, be it in Spain, France or the United Kingdom was full of regions with special rights and special laws. However, things changed in the 19th century. At that time, Spain was consolidated as a modern state and then decided to innovate the model of Napoleon's France. That is a centrist

Speaker 1:          03:20          model.

Speaker 2:          03:24          Well. That means that almost every law would be dictated from the capsule and would apply equally throughout the territory. As you can imagine, this did not please the Novari's and the Basque citizens. Suddenly that's paying more taxes and do compulsory military service. Not a great combination. There's explains why during the 19th century, Spain had not one, not two, but three civil wars. These were the so called car list was where the old regime supporters mainly basques and Novaris fought against the Spanish army. Then in 1876 when these novaris basket trips where if he did the laws abolished, suddenly these four provinces have to follow the laws that came from the dread and in addition, they have to pay a percentage of their taxes to the central states and Roseanne Madrid's allowed them to retain a special fiscal status. And this concession is what we call the Basque agreement, which as you can see, wasn't born in the middle ages, but it was approved in exchange for abolishing of the laws. But it doesn't end there.

Speaker 2:          04:28          Decades later in 1939 Franco's dictatorship eliminated this economic agreement, but only in the two provinces that didn't support him. We boost Koa and Vizcaya. No, as you can already see from all of this is around the torture of story with wars and demands from both sides, both provinces, which lost their special fiscal conditions where especially hers, and this can be seen today where a huge percentage of Bisco lions and Quepos Koans wants independence from Spain and all. This explains why in the 1970s the new democratic Spanish constitutions writers it to compensate bask and Navarro the Basque agreements resends but this time in a modernized version, the Basque quota, this is one of the most confusing issues in Spanish politics. See, if a citizen lives in Malaga Raw, valid, the lid, he or she pays most of their taxes directly to the central governments. Of course, there are some special taxes that depends on the city or the autonomous community. That's the vast majority goes to the National Treasury afterwards, the state distributes this money among the different autonomous governments as they see fit.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Yes,

Speaker 2:          05:41          these are the so called autonomic transfers. And of course some regions tend to benefits from these transverse and others are harmed. In theory, and this is quite debatable, the richer regions help the poorer regions. However, both Navarro ans the Basque country have a different system. In this case, the provincial governments collect almost all of the taxes. And notice it that I said provincial. This means that if a citizen lives, for example, in Bilbao, they do not pay taxes to the Basque government, but to the Vizcaya provincial council, and this provincial governments has the autonomy to do things like this.

Speaker 2:          06:23          This KAIA will change taxes on company profits to increase competitiveness. So maybe you remember in another video we told you why Switzerland is so rich. Now, one of the reasons for this is that in Switzerland, each cans on it can compete with each other by offering better fiscal conditions. Well, something similar is happening in the basket and the Var provinces. And that explains why it taxation in these regions is a little lower than it is in the rest of Spain. Nope. You may be wondering, do these provincial councils pay nothing to the Spanish state? Well, no, there's none of that. So that's where the so called basket quarter comes into play. The Basque quota is the percentage these regions pay to the central government in exchange for the common services they enjoy for belonging.

Speaker 1:          07:05          Thanks.

Speaker 2:          07:09          Sample the army, embassies and roads. All these are paid by Madrid, but the basques can also enjoy them. They therefore I have to pay part of the cost. And not only that, if for example, Spain decided to increase the defense budget, the basket quarter would also grow proportionally. As you can imagine, all of this is the irascible. The truth isn't the basket quota is the result of political negotiations. That's a different story for a different day. The truth is those, unlike all the other autonomous communities, the Basque country and Nevara know exactly how much money they pay for the common cause and how much remains, and in most cases, this is a fantastic advantage. But just wait a moment because this doesn't end. Yeah. In principal, it might seem that the economic agreements is a fair system. Everything in the negotiation is black and white, but the truth is that the system is far from perfect. Do you remember when I said that the central state distributes the money that it collects among the different autonomous communities? While the truth is that both Nevara ans the Basque country belong to this distribution and it's being such rich regions, it would be logical to think that they would contribute more than they receive. Well, that is totally not happening.

Speaker 1:          08:26          Basque

Speaker 2:          08:26          country receives twice as many resources per capita as Madrid, Catalonia, or Andalusia and say, now you maybe asking yourself this and that as well. How is this possible? The reason why it's purely political, as I was saying, basket nationalism is as important as Kassala national, isn't it? That means there's these autonomous communities have their own political parties, parties such as the Basque Nationalist Party, which holds its communities, governments and has a strong representation and the national parliaments, well, every year the central government has to approve national budgets in parliaments for that, they need an absolute majority and majority that's in most cases requires support from these parties. However, this isn't the only reason for the Basque country's prosperity. Not at all. In fact, there's much more at play here and look into it right now.

Speaker 2:          09:20          Germany and Spain, have you heard of a company called Audley? Well, if you have a gas stove, you might own some of their products. It's the world leader in manufacturing systems for preventing accidents and gas leaks and their headquarters are in order Zia a town in the gift this Koa province. The same goes for j m a if you have an armored door in your house, it's highly likely that both the lock and the keys have been manufactured by this company, which is located in drag on. This is a small Basque town. These are the so called hidden leaders. They are small, hyper specialized companies that have become benchmarks in their niche and which have devastated the international markets. In a previous video we told you, you have Germany o's part of its wealth to Middle Astons. Well, the Basque economic model is very similar. Moreover, if you have the opportunity to travel by road through IES Katie, you'll see factories disbursed throughout its landscape. In fact, it's population is much more scattered than anywhere else in Spain. Of course, there are large cities, but most people live in urban centers have less than 40,000 inhabitants. These municipalities, business hubs then employ locals in the Basque country. Economic activity isn't only concentrated in large cities, and I, you may ask yourself, well, why does [inaudible] have such a homogenous business network for this? We resent to the same principle at knots, decentralization by having four different treasuries with autonomy to collects taxes and make investments. There's a higher tax competition than in any other parts of Spain. This means that public investments arms concentrated in a specific place, but are distributed evenly.

Speaker 2:          11:04          Investing in startups will have a 30% deduction in GIB boosie core. In other words, it's true, both the basques ans the Novari is have a huge advantage because they receive money from the central states, but that money has been invested much more efficiently than in any other region. In fact, isn't it a coincidence that these two communities are the least indebted in all of Spain? And that's in addition, they have hardly any of the corruption cases that have poisoned the rest of the car

Speaker 1:          11:33          tree.

Speaker 2:          11:37          So now the question is, do you think some elements of the basket Novari's models could be rescued and replicated in other countries? Do you think it would be possible to apply the Basque agreements to other regions? Well, let us know in the comments section below.
