Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, November the 26th 2017 a hundred euros held elections, some very peculiar elections, even though millions of people were called upon to vote that day. Only one vote really counts and in the end, and that was the vote of the president's one whole Ando Hernandez who decided to stay for another four years. No nuts or what the polls said.

Speaker 2:          00:25          Joe, look at Dana.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Yeah, this president's Hernandez very probably just told himself, well, hey, I like being president a lot. So why leave?

Speaker 3:          00:48          Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Since then, protests due to what has obviously been a rigged election and assault on democracy have occurred quite frequently. Honduras is a country that already suffers from the tragic consequences of a social and political model full of corruption and violence. How model, dear viewer, that is so disastrous and dysfunctional that it let Honduras to be the poorest country in Latin America and the third most dangerous country in the world's, which isn't presently at war.

Speaker 3:          01:15          Cool.

Speaker 1:          01:19          See, Honduras is a small tropical country with just over 9 million inhabitants. The cases on a narrow strip of land that separates the Caribbean sea from the Pacific Ocean. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Indeed. Honduras is one of those places where we can find some of the most incredible beaches in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:37          Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Sandy, crystal clear waters and lots and lots of coconut trees.

Speaker 3:          01:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Sounds rather nice. It doesn't it as I, fortunately, drug trafficking gangs and a political and economic elites have prioritized above all plundering of a nation's resources. They have muddied and stains the reality of a country that could otherwise be safe and possibly even be considered a true paradise here on earth.

Speaker 4:          02:01          Some people don't want to come here to claim bodies because they don't want to be associated with their family member who ends up dead because here this gang members come here to the medical examiners office and they case out families to figure out who is next in that family unit that they would be attacked.

Speaker 3:          02:24          Let's,

Speaker 1:          02:25          you might be thinking right now, I mean a small remote, poor country, just another drop in the ocean of problems. I said, well, wait a minute, because there's a lot more at work. Yeah. What would you think if I told you that we might be facing the first coup de ta supported by the trump administration? Well, just check this out.

Speaker 3:          02:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Fraud.

Speaker 3:          02:57          Awesome. On Sunday,

Speaker 1:          02:58          November the 26th 2017

Speaker 5:          03:01          general elections were held in Honduras and there were two major contenders for the presidency, which is the most important political position in the country. On the one hands, we've got president one Alando Hernandez, who was widely supported by the country's economic leadership and the international community, and he was aspiring to be reelected or reelection. By the way, that was very controversial because in principle, the country's constitution prevents it under article 239 and article that was declared in applicable in 2015 by a surprising and very controversial decision from the Supreme Court. Now, do bear in mind here that the supreme court is in actuality controlled by the presidents, so maybe that might have had something to do with it. It's just maybe is gay and Lasalla constitutional to show me

Speaker 1:          03:49          this is what article 239 set. If a citizen has held the ownership of the executive power, he or she cannot be the president or designee. Article two 39 of the Honduran Constitution. Now, on the other hand, Salvador Nasralla, right? Popular television presents that ran as a candidate for the center left parties coalition, the opposition alliance

Speaker 5:          04:11          slavery. I think that is, or or we didn't say yes that moment though, Latina Scitech, whatever. So even you must go amigo.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Well, the fact is that in the initial vote counts, everything pointed to Salvador. Nasralla is

Speaker 3:          04:36          sorry.

Speaker 1:          04:38          With almost 60% of the votes counted, he had a five point lead over the president's. The advantage was so overwhelming that the magistrates who formed the Honduras Supreme Electoral Tribunal qualified this lead as irreversible and insurmountable. However, suddenly the counting stopped, there was no additional information. Can we use a system? Simply collapsed. New balance appeared and in the end, several days later, the electorial tribunal awarded a surprising victory to precedent one Orlando Hernandez,

Speaker 5:          05:06          one lieutenant [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:14          Then when it's so many irregularities that the organization of American States of self rejected the recounts and calls for new elections.

Speaker 5:          05:21          It's a good video. [inaudible] Ella oil proponent [inaudible] he gets it, but he's, and the impulsivity that [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:35          but that's not all. One day before the elections, the economist published on its website that he'd had a recording that proved the government was preparing to distort the results of this

Speaker 3:          05:45          [inaudible]. So the big

Speaker 1:          05:54          question now is, well, was the election actually, now that is hard to say for sure, but let's just say that the chances are really, really high. All of this is without mentioning the governments authoritarian behavior. Of course, once the possibility of electoral fraud was on the table, the opposition mobilized and organized protest rallies. They were peaceful at first, but the police didn't really seem to cap. They still used as much force on the protesters as they want it. For example, on the evening of Wednesday, the 29th state forces fired tear gas at a rally of about a thousand people who were peacefully awaiting the results. Indeed. In this group there was even the opposition leader, Salvador Nasralla, the police, they didn't care that it was a peaceful demonstration or that they were children and elderly people

Speaker 3:          06:38          present.

Speaker 6:          06:53          No

Speaker 3:          06:55          g

Speaker 1:          07:01          even decreed a curfew, and since then rallies have been put down with 30 people being killed and is more than 800 people being detained. In other words, the evidence really does point to a rigged election followed by forceful repression or simply to reinforce the victory.

Speaker 6:          07:21          Okay, Nadia.

Speaker 1:          07:28          Now having said that, we have several questions that need an answer and it's clearly one of them is who exactly is the president? Who is Juan Orlando Hernandez,

Speaker 3:          07:42          the president,

Speaker 1:          07:46          two versions and they're really different interpretations. The first is that of a leader with a strong hands, but who can clearly rescue his country from becoming a failed state. The second is that of an authoritarian leader involved in corruption and crime, a leader who was taking control of the country's institutions and to managers them based on his own interests. This is something we saw in the case of the Supreme Court and reelection.

Speaker 2:          08:09          Bang.

Speaker 1:          08:22          The president, as we will see in more detail in a moment, has the support of the United States of America, among others, and it'd be fair, we must say that his mandate has had many dark times, but it's also had some good ones. Let's start with these good ones.

Speaker 3:          08:42          See,

Speaker 1:          08:42          when Kwan Orlando Hernandez came to power in 2013 on has had the highest homicide rates of a country that was not at war. Every 13 hours a woman is murdered in this country, the number of violent of women in Honduras has risen 260% it is true that nowadays the country, it's still has a serious problem. It is still ranked the third west country when it comes to homicides in relation to its population. And further, there's the problem, but 90% of these crimes remain unpunished, but things while they have improved, in fact, this is the president's main pride, them

Speaker 3:          09:15          joy

Speaker 1:          09:17          in the United States, the governments often jurists has created a new special police force, which is financed, equipped, and trained by the dea and FBI among others. At the same time it is expelled and replaced thousands of corrupt agents. It has dismantled several drug cartels and extradited dozens of drug traffickers to the United States and even created parks around the country which are guarded by the military police so that children and families can enjoy their leisure time safely. I look Joe Folio platform aspect. We went by Ethan medicine. So far so good, right? But unfortunately their view of the story does not end there with rainbows and butterflies

Speaker 3:          10:04          is

Speaker 1:          10:06          is player evidence of the presidents corruption. In fact, the 2013 election campaign that brought him to power was financed by money stolen from the Honduran Institute of Social Security and there are even well founded suspicions that presidents or Lando cause connections with drug trafficking group,

Speaker 1:          10:23          illegal drug trade in Honduras, not only infected much of its civil society, including the highest levels of government and its financial sector, but also brought frightening levels of violence to its people. June h Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan. In any case, whether these accusations are true or not, repression, deception, and it's controlling, institutions can neither be justified. Snore contribution to Honduras, being able to overcome the problems that impede its development. The president has clear support from the international community. He has received money, police aid and its military and political support, and the truth is the people, they expected something different. Bus, of course, Divya, all of this isn't that strange in this country.

Speaker 3:          11:08          Okay. A cocktail

Speaker 1:          11:10          of corruption and violence. Honduras is facing a difficult problem that is a triangle of interrelated powers that make being an optimist in Honduras, very, very difficult political power. The economic oligarchy and drug traffickers grabs the most representative case of all this. Is that a fabby Yo Lobo, he's the son of Porphyria Lobo, the former president of the republic who was just been sentenced in the United States to 24 years in prison for his involvement and activities as a drug trafficker. He actually did this when his father was president of the republic and no, we're not talking about a rebellious son or anything like that. It's drug trafficking, by the way. It's currently the country's main economic activity. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:56          we'll fed thick on it. I hold them. We changed it to [inaudible] Sierras. Another example is the New York Times reported is parliaments. It's an underequipped building from the 1950s that lacks the minimum necessary conditions, which contrast with the deputies parking lost a parking lots that is full of off road vehicles. All the latest and most expensive models, and this affects practically everyone, but if the governments and as the opposition, the police and security forces entre moved from this, either extortion and bribery is common and it's widely known that police members have ties with gangs and drug traffickers.

Speaker 7:          12:34          Mara Salvatrucha gangsters in Rivera Hernandez say they receive warnings from the police of impending sweeps and are handed captured rivals to execute for anything from $440 to $2,200 ahead. Sonia Nazario, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist,

Speaker 1:          12:50          politicians, security forces, gangs, drug traffickers, and lastly the economic oligarchy.

Speaker 3:          12:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          13:00          10 families controlled practically every economic resource and have no problems paying bribes and displacing trustworthy people in the powerful positions do generate something that is not a market model, but a model that is entirely controlled by the institution. This nice to have a highly extractive results network, and it's ultimately responsible for Honduras and knots being that paradise that we discussed at the beginning of the video. But we also mentioned the u s government, specifically the trump administration as possibly being responsible for what happens with Honduras is elections. So let's get into it.

Speaker 7:          13:40          Washington's important,

Speaker 3:          13:43          yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:44          be forgiven for thinking initially that Honduras is not that important to Washington DC rice, but not exactly the truth is that Honduras has a certain importance to the United States for three main reasons. Firstly, because a lot of the flights suspected of transporting drugs from South America have to first stop in this country. Exactly. They think is two years ago, faced with countries, enormous crisis, 18,000 a year in children traveled alone to the United States border, and nobody in Washington really wants to see that happen again. And thirdly, because Honduras has traditionally been an allied country, in fact, the United States has had a military base there for decades. Due to all of this, the u s has spent billions of dollars in Honduras in recent years to try and reverse the country's problems. While the trump administration, it knows this, and this is why it supports Juan Orlando Hernandez. Indeed, this is what a prominent Republican advisor said about the matter. Washington

Speaker 7:          14:37          has invested significant money in Central America to help turn the security and economic situation around. If Hernandez loses the election, the United States will have no effective partners in the region. The effectiveness of our billions would be at risk and more people might be to come to

Speaker 1:          14:52          the United States. Danielle ruined day or Republican foreign policy adviser and former official of the George W. Bush administration. Yes, Washington support is clear. In fact, the police, which were trains and financed by the United States, participated in the post electoral events without any complaints from the u s embassy. And this is because the u s government fears the tires that Salvador Nasralla his candidacy you could have with the Cuban regime and even the regime of Maduro in Venezuela. This is something, by the way, that the candidate deniers, they're wrong because my model is based in Uruguay or Chili's, moderate left or Costa Rica's moderate, right? One thing is the friendship that my ideological partner, Manuel's Aaliyah has with Maduro Miralis and something very different is what I think me who would be the President Salvador Nasralla. Anyway, for everyone watching this video from Honduras, we should state that things can change and do tend to change.

Speaker 1:          15:48          There's the case of Columbia as an example. One, I was the alternate.
