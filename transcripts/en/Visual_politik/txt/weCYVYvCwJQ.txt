Speaker 1:          00:08          Just before we get into the video today, do you want to say that I recently started a new channel, it's called biographics. We do long form, 20 minutes ish biographies of people from history as well as the present day politicians, but a whole lot else. Please check out the link in the striction below and if you'd like biographics please subscribe anyway. Well, everybody has their eyes on North Korea, not their nuclear programs. Still worries those in the White House. That is the nuclear program of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Speaker 1:          00:35          This country has such a bad reputation that when we talk about it, it can feel like we're talking about one of those places that only exists in the movies, one of those countries dominated by evil leaders who dream of destroying the world. Well, that might actually be some truth to this, but definitely not as much as some seemed thing. In fact, Iran is not the most religious. It's not the most authoritarian and it's not even the most hostile place towards women in this part of the world because we have Saudi Arabia, which is far, far worse. Dev, you have, Iran is a country of contradictions, a country whose government claims to work under a democratic system, but at the same time everything is under the control of one man.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16          That man would be allie harmony, the supremes. At first glance, he isn't as scary as its predecessor Ruhollah Khomeini, who was scary. Just have look at the truth is how many econ stand anything modern for him? Modality might as well have come from Satan himself except for nuclear technology, of course, explains why in the past few years around has been famous for two things. Number one, being one of the country's alongside China, where the most people are executed every year and number two, wanting to build their own nuclear bomb. However, unlike what has happened with the North Korean crisis, the US and Iran, they did reach an agreement.

Speaker 2:          02:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:07          In 2015, President Obama led the joint comprehensive plan of action and agreements to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb as an agreement to this many of considered to be one of the greatest achievements in all the foreign policy.

Speaker 3:          02:20          It's now more than 50 years since President Kennedy stood before the American people and said, let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Although to Fab all signs seem to point to the conclusion that this agreement has not kept either party. Saturday presidents of the United States now, Donald Trump is pretty clear about his opinion on the deal ever since he was a candidate. He has described it as the worst agreement ever negotiated during his campaign. Trump has vowed on many, many occasions that his top priority would be to put an end to such a catastrophic agreements. I've been doing deals for a long time, been making lots

Speaker 4:          03:00          of wonderful deals, great deals. That's what I do. Never ever, ever in my life have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran.

Speaker 1:          03:15          And do you think that this was the typical campaign message that every politician repeats over and over again, but then soon forgets about? Well, once the election has finished, in his first speech at the UN assembly, trump repeated it loud and clear.

Speaker 4:          03:28          The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one sided transaction the United States has ever entered into. Frankly that deal is an embarrassment to the United States and I don't think you've heard the last of it. Believe me,

Speaker 1:          03:46          they haven't done so. Yes, but it is true that both the president sands, many other members of the Republican Party load, yes, absolutely low disagreements and they do so because among other things agreements, we're also signed with North Korea. This is a good deal for the United States. North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea and our other allies will be better protected and well, these agreements, they didn't work at all except for allowing [inaudible] to lay hands on the bomb. Well, now you might be wondering why exactly is it such a controversial agreements? Well, we're going to look at that in a bit. Before we do. Let's take a look at the context in which it was signed. Iran, a budding superpower. So during the Cold War it is said that the Russians were so obsessed that they saw a Chinese man behind every tree. Something similar might not actually be happening between it wrong and the USA, since the Islamic revolution of command I in 1979 in Iran has become one of Washington's worst enemies. It is accused of being the first sponsor of radical and anti American groups like Hezbollah, Hamas or the Taliban. Not to mention their support of the Syrian regime under the Shah, Al Assad, but there is more to this. Washington knows very well that Iran, it's not just any country.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Iran is absolutely huge. It's got $8, million inhabitants and one of the greatest amounts of mineral wealth on and hey, it's not just about oil and natural gas here, but it's also got other minerals like copper, iron, zinc, uranium, silver, etc. Yes, we do all know that oil and natural gas spelled that particularly important and that is why I now want to ask you a question. What is the biggest fear of manY analysts in Washington? Well, that is the sum of Iraq and Iran. So let me explain both countries and neighbors ever majority shia ruled and influence of tehran or baghdad has skyrocketed in the last few years.

Speaker 2:          06:03          Yes,

Speaker 1:          06:05          we add up the oil reserves of both countries for the amount is one of the largest in the world. It's larger than Saudi Arabia. It's larger than Venezuela, so coordinated international politics between these two countries would result in a superpower which is outside the control of Washington with almost a hundred and 20 million people that's not mentioning all of those other natural resources. This quite simply would be an incredible amount of influence, so then what would happen if Iran got a hold of a nuclear bomb? Now, on the one hand, it would certainly consolidate its role as an international suva power as well as its influence over its allies like Iraq, but on the other hand, it would also trigger an arms race with Saudi Arabia and the emirates countries that have already said they won't be left behind. If tiran managers to get a nuclear bomb. The results of all this, well, that's pretty obvious. It's tension, it's risk of proliferation, it's risk of nuclear disaster. That's also a loss of american leverage in the area. It goes without saying, but seeing such radical governments in possession of such powerful weapons also doesn't make anyone feel particularly safe. Well, that was the situation when the agreement was reached back in 2015,

Speaker 2:          07:18          the deal

Speaker 1:          07:22          years. The United States is trying to stop the nuclear program with financial penalties, but these were pretty useless. Didn't they harm the economy in Iran? Well, absolutely, but they did nothing to stop their nuclear program. Finally, on november the 14th of July, 2015, the nuclear deal was signed an agreement with a clear target to prevent proliferation and make sure Iran only uses nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. However, since then the deal, it has suffered harsh attacks. We're going to have a look at some of the reasons cited by critics of this agreement, but first I think now is a good time to think about the circumstances under which this agreement was signed and the first thing we need to note is that the nuclear program in Iran is very, very advanced. AccordIng to us intelligence. If the agreement was to be broken, Iran could develop its first nuclear bomb in a matter of months. This is the way it is today, 2017, and it was even true back in 2015 when the iranian program was working at it's fullest capacity. That is why I want to take a moment to think about three possible outcomes here, more agreements or Iran with nuclear capability,

Speaker 1:          08:39          so stopping the nuclear program with military intervention. It would not have been an easy task. It would have resulted in many victims. The costs for the us would have been prohibitive and the us. We've had to keep a military intervention in the middle east for decades to compare. It is estimated that this would be the Iraq war multiplied by five because I mean it's one thing to destroy infrastructure and it's a very different thing to eliminate the knowledge that a country has to make nuclear bombs. Obama kneW that the situation was totally impossible. What he wanted was to get away from the middle east and not get into any more trouble in this region because it's been something of a chronic nightmare for the United States. Sure. On the other hand is not doing anything. Would've meant that Iran, we've gotten their new toy and as we have seen, it would have resulted in an arms race in the region, which Washington didn't want either. So an agreement, it was the only option left. I mean, we make a deal and everyone's happy, right? Just wait there for a second. Because despite that many experts, especially republicans, don't even want to hear about this pact.

Speaker 5:          09:44          Bad deal. Obama broke every rule of negotiation. We get an agreement, a very questionable value. If I am elected president on the very first day in office, I Will rip to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal. The iranians have been given a blank check basically by, uh, by depressing the United States.

Speaker 1:          10:05          I think it will just warhawks determined to impose their ideas by forced, well, maybe there are some like that. But the truth is, they all say the points they say when they arise, that the u s already signed many agreements with North Korea and pyong yang never kept its weren't which is wide. North korean is now in nuclear power. They are convinced that Iran will do the same and there is no better evidence than the fact that Iran has not stopped their ballistic missile program.

Speaker 6:          10:31          Iran is boosting its missile capabilities in order to increase the accuracy, precision and range Iran will not stop its missile projects

Speaker 1:          10:41          and this program, what has being developed with North Korea and technology. So it seems clear which way deal with Iran will go.

Speaker 4:          10:48          We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.

Speaker 1:          11:10          The science, since the bank does a limited duration, Iran could still put itself in a position to get its arsenal. The moment the deal is over and it could be armed within a matter of months. However, as we have seen the alternatives, they're really not any better is that Iran doesn't necessarily need to go the way of North Korea.

Speaker 5:          11:30          You're on

Speaker 6:          11:31          benefits of the agreement.

Speaker 1:          11:34          I'm pretty sure many of you are thinking that comparing North Korea and Iran is easy after all, both countries are radical dictatorships, right? Well, I mean not really to be. Third things that quite a bit different. Iranian society is much more open minded than north korean society. In Iran there is a well formed middle class. There are political debates and things like having a smartphone and access to the internet. It's really quite common. In fact, most Iranians, especially the younger generation, clearly pro agreements, you see, it's not just a matter of international politics, it's also a matter of quantity of life. The penalties is put in place by the international community. They were very damagIng for her in 2013 when presidents ahmadinejad the main defender of the agreements left power the economy of Iran. It waS devastated. For an investment vanished. The unemployment rate skyrocketed. Inflation grew to around 40 percent and the expectations for improvements, it's high. In short, it was a complete mess, but thanks to the agreement that penalties started to disappear and since then aisle exports of triples. I mean Iraq is not North Korea. They need the trade on the economic advantages that disagreement is.

Speaker 2:          12:44          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          12:46          Joint comprehensive plan of action will produce the comprehensive lifting of all un security council sanctions as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to iran's nuclear program, including steps on access in areas of trade, technology, finance, and energy.

Speaker 1:          13:05          The hope for obama's administration was that with a more prosperous and trade open Iran, the younger, more openminded generation would be allowed to take power in a few years. However, those who opposed the agreements argue it's necessary to be more demanding with roland because otherwise it will eventually become another North Korea, a new nuclear power. Anyway, it's not an easy situation is you can see, but truth be told, I think it would be a mistake to think that any pact is bad until proven otherwise. Having to run under pressure might be a good strategy, but let's be careful not to go too far, but we could all lose. Well, now it's your turn. If you were the president of the United States, what do you think you would do with Iran, which you make a deal, but leave your answer in the comments below as well as in this survey and I do really hope that you enjoyed this video.
