Speaker 1:          00:07          Aw,

Speaker 2:          00:08          Germany is the place where BMW Rammstein and FK. That's nudist culture were born. Yeah. Nevertheless, Gemini has something even more important than all of these things, and that is the fact that it is the world's ultimate factory. Yep. You heard that rice, and I can guess what you're probably thinking right now. Wait a minute, Simon isn't shiner the country? You are a TV screens, mobile phones as well. Practically every good under the sun is made.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:41          The thing is that's not entirely true. Now of course China does lead the charge when it comes to exports, but do you know wasp, in order to manufacture all of those products, they need to import a lot of things from abroad. Germany in standard sells way more than what it binds. In fact, one out of every 10 product sold on the international market is made in this country, which has a population 15 times. It's smaller than sure

Speaker 1:          01:04          why now.

Speaker 2:          01:08          Yes, we all know those big German car companies like BMW, Audi, or Volkswagen. But that is way more than that. If you don't believe me, well, just consider your mobile phone. And I know, I know on the back is going to say something like assembled in the People's Republic of China, but I'm not talking about this. I'm talking about if you open up that phone that you're going to find a bunch of microchips insight as an example here of that chip that makes your phone till you know when you rotate it in the screen matches up. Vance probably most likely made by a German company called Bosch Sensor attack, but not only that, many of the robots is instilling these Chinese factories assembling these phones are probably made in Germany.

Speaker 2:          01:51          In other words, in Germany, they manufacture the things that go inside of other things that are manufactured by things that are made in Germany and now you might be wondering how is any of that possible? I mean factories, they should be built in places with cheap labor costs, right? I mean, how is it possible Germany with relatively high salaries is such an industrial powerhouse. Well, the good news is that today we're going to answer that question for you, but as always, before we get into all of that, let's take a look back at the history. Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:18          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:24          Liberalism offset wells was it? Europe was pretty done, destroyed. Countries like Italy, France, western Germany, which was the capitalist side of Germany. They got a massive money groans from their good friends. Uncle Sam. Wait just a minute because each of these countries use that money in totally different ways. The French president for instance, what's this guy that you'd see on tv? Generally Joe's, they go. It all came from the military who was no friend of private companies is political creed. The so called dirtied sma was nationalizing big businesses and leading the whole country's economy as if it wasn't

Speaker 1:          03:03          army.

Speaker 2:          03:08          They chose a totally different path. Both the Chancellor Conrad, either an hour and his finance minister Ludvig Ah, heart spent years thinking about that new and economic system. It was a mixture between the composition of free market capitalism and the safety nets provided by the government. They then decided to give this system what is probably the worst name in the world ever be called it auto liberalism or social marketing.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Honami

Speaker 2:          03:33          addition is the most promising means to achieve and secure prosperity nude vic Elford and other words, while the goal centralize the economy in Paris. Conrad, I don't know. I designed a system where the government would put into place a set of conditions that the other players would make that own decisions. This explains why in Germany, trade unions, regional governments, and of course companies are quite too important. Didn't say. Now you might be wondering what are the keys that are needed for a system like this to work and well, has it really worked out? It's all, well, let's get right into that stable currency. I'm pretty sure at some point you've had some economists saying that devaluing your currency boosts Zach Sports, right? For instance, imagine we have a shoe manufacturing facility in Mexico and we want to sell a pair of shoes to the American market. Let's say the price of the shoes is 2000 and Mexican pesos at the time and making this video, those 2000 pesos is equal to about 110 US dollars. Let's say that all of a sudden, Mexican central bank decides to print money and therefore devalue its currency from one day to the next. The pair of shoes could be worth 90 US dollars. Therefore, it'd be easier to sell these shoes abroad. Now, this is a theory, it's actually supported by most governments today. Now the Germans, they actually decided to do the exact opposites and for the later part of the 20th century, the German mark was actually one of the most stable currencies in the entire world.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Wow.

Speaker 2:          05:02          This might lead you to one's out. Wow. How is it possible that Germany could export so much when their products, what not actually that sheep. All right. Well, let's go back to our shoes example for just a moment, but actually this is, I'm going to tell you the story of a real company. This is a company from the north of Germany and it's called Desmos. It's not a particularly big business. It has around 200 staff now, this company, it started right after the war being founded in 1946 and they specialized in making machines for shoe manufacturing. Now in order to do this, they needed to import lots of machines from the United States and thanks to having a stable currency, the price for importing those machines, it was relatively low. They then decided to rent the facility because at the end of the day, since there was no inflation, rents would not go up and they could calculate the future cost. All of this space reliable,

Speaker 1:          05:55          but

Speaker 2:          05:55          it wasn't any of that. Since German companies could offer lower prices, desmond had to innovate and in 1960 they invested in state of the art technologies to manufacture rubber sole shoes. 10 years later, decimate was the world leader in pvc souls. It's in fact like lever at the soles of the shoes you're wearing right now are made by a decimal machine. This company with 200 staff now sells to every country in the world, including, yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:22          China.

Speaker 2:          06:26          I need know. This is just one example of the thousands of small and medium sized companies. The so called middle stand vertically made up Germany, the middle stand success as attracted, admiring glances from the rest of Europe. But it's built on foundations that may be hard to copy. And yes, I know, I know Jim and mark is a thing of the past because in 2008 the Germans, they abandon this currency and they adopted the euro. But think about it, while other countries like Spain, they were using weaker countries before Germany had had a strong currency for decades. That means that in 2002 German companies were already more competitive than anyone else's. But again, hold on a minute because there's many other things that can explain the success of the German model. So let's dig into these now

Speaker 2:          07:16          the educational system. Now I can probably guess what you're gonna say. Come on. Zion in Germany isn't really famous for its educational system, is it? And to some extent, that's right. If you look at the piece of revolt, Germany isn't even ranking inside the top 10 but then again, German students managed to find a job right after they finish their studies. So we've not such a great educational system world. Why is this happening? Well, the answer of that actually the in that boot Haitian or training system. Now let's imagine you're a high school students in Germany and you don't want to go to university. So instead you decide to study to become made plummet. Well, from the first moment you're already going to be working for a company which has an arrangement with the school. This means from Monday to Wednesday you go to a classroom and from Thursday to Friday you go to the company's workshops

Speaker 1:          08:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:03          that you would be trained by the experienced plumbers and you would get a salary of between 300 to $500 a month. And this salary is actually pretty important because it means that the company that a pain you really want to make you work. I mean, otherwise the firms pretty much just throwing money away.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Wait.

Speaker 2:          08:24          The outcome of this is that Jen and students know how it is to be in a real life working environments. In fact, many of them actually remain in the company where they did their training is of course these gen and funds. In exchange, they get well trained workers and another on the subject of workers. Let us move on to another key piece of the German system.

Speaker 1:          08:45          German

Speaker 2:          08:45          trade unions in other countries like France or Spain, most of the labor laws are made by parliaments, but that's not the case in Germany until 2015 gentleman's didn't even have a minimum. Salaries were negotiated by trade unions and employers in Germany. Syndicates are extremely important. Actually. Those big companies like Audi or BMW with more than 2000 workers are required to have union representatives on their administrative.

Speaker 2:          09:11          Instead of this, Siemens has 10 shareholder representatives on their board and therefore they must have 10 people representing the workers. Remember that? This one, because it makes a big difference in Spain, there's an example of another country. I think company like Telefonica has no trade union representatives on their board of administration. The unions going to be participate in another body, which is called the company council and they can only speak about matters that affect salaries or working conditions. Now by contrast in Germany, trade unions have a voice on every decision that the company makes. When Siemens wants to start operating in a new market or launch a new product, they have to ask the shareholders of course, but they also have to ask for that trade union representatives. Now you might be wondering, isn't this just bad news for the company? I mean, we pretty much take it for granted that unions and companies not exactly best friends. Well, it doesn't actually have to be that way. Think about it for a moment. Thanks to this setup, Siemens and bmws workers, they know whether a company is doing well or whether they're losing money, and of course when things are going bad for the company, they can make compromises like reducing their working hours instead of being fired,

Speaker 2:          10:22          cut working hours at German facilities. This explains why during the financial crisis of 2008 German companies didn't fire a large number of people. Well, this is good for the workers. It's good for the company.

Speaker 2:          10:37          Wait a minute because I know what you're thinking right now. Please. Jen and trade unions are collaborating with big capitalists in order to exploit the workers rice, rice, I mean it must be happening. Well, the answer is actually, certainly not. The reality is that the average wage in Germany is around 3,400 US dollars a month. That's higher than the state of New York and that's in a country with a pretty affordable cost of living. A flat in Berlin is about half the price of a flat in New York City and despite all of this, Germany maintains its position as the third biggest country when it comes to export.

Speaker 2:          11:11          So then the question becomes, do you think your country could benefit from the German model or perhaps do you think these policies are impossible to implement elsewhere?
