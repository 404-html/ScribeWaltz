Speaker 1:          00:08          We can't hide it here, a visual politic. We Love Asia, man, that's poorly because we believe that the world sends him is already on this continent, but in the last few decades, one country has stood out of that crowd and that's country, whether it's China

Speaker 1:          00:33          for its huge size and the speed of which this country is growing. China deserves to be given the chief role in this super production that is changing our harness, but wait just a second, let's not rush into this whole thing. China, it's certainly not perfect. Indeed. The country has some pretty major problems. On the 23rd of May, 2017, Moody's, one of the three agencies in charge of rating the solvency and risk of financial products downgraded the rating of China's debt and this is the first reduction Moody's has made on China's debt in 27 years. Okay. Now I know what you're thinking. Moody's really raising agencies in general. I mean they rarely seem to get it right and yeah, while it is true, it is also one of the only things that we have to judge. This sort of thing is still overwhelmingly rely on standard and Poor's Moody's and Fitch when deciding whether to buy bonds, the three issue more than 95 percent of global bond ratings. The thing is, do you view as China has faced two major threats in the last few years, less growth and much, much more debt. In fact, this has even led to unimportant question Cam China go back

Speaker 2:          01:41          crops.

Speaker 1:          01:46          China's great growth. If we had a time machine and the opportunity to travel back to Mao's China, the country we would find would be completely different to the one that we find today. There wouldn't be any skyscrapers, any malls. In fact, there really wouldn't be much of anything in the 19 seventies. China was a mainly agricultural country and it was extremely painful. A few years often now had died and man known as Dung Xiaoping came to power. He realized that communism, well, it really hadn't worked. It's all immediately put into practice a set of measures that would change China for rather these reforms and be changed. The China has gone through since they're actually going to be the subject of an upcoming visual politic video, so please don't forget to subscribe to this channel right now. All right, done that well. That's carry on for now. It's important to you. Remember something done. Joe Ping was a turning point for China. Since then, China has undergone the greatest economic revolution in the history of mankind. The last three decades. China has managed to take $500 people out of poverty

Speaker 3:          03:00          and to become the largest industrial and trading power on the planet.

Speaker 1:          03:04          In other words, if we ask any Chinese person about his or her living standards, the answer will be now is infinitely better than it was before. Please don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of poverty in China, but compared to how it was, it's a whole lot better today, but as long as I was saying earlier, it's certainly not all roses and there are some serious clouds on the horizon, a system addicted to debt. I'll be quick look at this chart which shows what happens. Do you Chinese debt in the last few years? As you can see, it goes up and up and up, and I mean, well, that's a seriously steep line on the other hands. Look closely at what has happened is do Chinese economic growth. As you can see. Well this Charles, it's headed in the opposite direction, so in other words, in China the economy is declining and the debt wouldn't stop rising.

Speaker 2:          04:11          Look,

Speaker 1:          04:12          gross terms. The Chinese debt as multiplying by four since 2017.

Speaker 2:          04:16          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          04:18          Chinese debt now equals more than 260 percent of the GDP and many analysts consider this number to be especially high for a country that has yet to become one of the richest in the world.

Speaker 1:          04:28          Well, most of the debt is actually the responsibility of Chinese company.

Speaker 2:          04:31          Yes.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Well, the thing is that is a silver lining, but there is also a significant negative side and that is an. All this international expansion needs money and swell and the great deal of it as well. Much of the debt has financed the expansion of Chinese companies. They have also paid well for this kind of nonsense

Speaker 3:          04:54          throughout China. There are hundreds of cities that have almost everything one needs for modern urban lifestyle, high rise apartment complexes, developed waterfronts skyscrapers and even public art. Everything that is except one major factor

Speaker 1:          05:08          people so you can get some idea of the size of all of it has been built in China in the last few years. Hey, attention to the following number. In just three years, China is used more concrete than the United States used in the entire 20th century and as I said, everything absolutely everything has been paid for with debt. So now we come to a really important question. What the hell has happened in this country to cause it to get into quite so much debt,

Speaker 2:          05:40          trainees,

Speaker 3:          05:41          governments, forward

Speaker 2:          05:42          flight

Speaker 1:          05:46          the last few decades. If you could say that Chinese people were good at one thing, well it would be saving money. This is especially true if the oldest Chinese citizens, they work and they save ends weld. That is pretty much all they do. So thanks to all of that advert. China has high investment rates, but don't be fooled. What has happened in the last few years, it has nothing to do with this intelligence to know what has happened is we need to go back to 2008 at that time, all developed countries and we're going through a major financial crisis and you can probably imagine how this affected China's exports, which are the engine that keeps driving China forward. The truth is that at that time, the Chinese government was terrifying, that the country would be affected by the national crisis, so in order to prevent it, they came up with an idea. The economic system had to be transformed and they had two beds on domestic demands. When it comes through in the mouth of a politician that's domestic demands thing almost always means they are planning to start overspending and swelling. That's exactly what Beijing did.

Speaker 3:          06:51          The Chinese government started a colossal program of extra public spending of 4 trillion UN. About $600,000,000,000 meant to be used for building all kinds of infrastructure, high speed trains, underground trains, highways, houses, offices, Cetera, box.

Speaker 1:          07:05          They went further than that. The Chinese government's thoughts and that government overspending wasn't enough. So they had to encourage the companies to do the same. So the question was how could they do that? Well, they decided to use a traditional remedy,

Speaker 3:          07:20          2008, trying to also started one of the most expansive monetary policies ever known. The authorities lowered interest rates and banks gave money loans to everyone who asks for them. They practically establish an open bar of cheap lumps.

Speaker 1:          07:34          In three years. The price of housing was an average of two point four times more expensive to an apartments which costs $100,000. Three years before would now be worth $240,000. What was the result of all of this? Well, companies started to make all kinds of investments. They build ghost towns bought our companies all over the world and engaged in all kinds of projects. These are gone. Whatever crazy, risky projects they felt like after all this central bank was pretty much giving money away.

Speaker 3:          08:02          Reduction in key industries is damaging both China's economic sustainability and foreign trade relations.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Obviously many of these projects have never been profitable, so the companies can't give the money back. So what did they do that? Well, they simply asked for new loans to pay back the old ones and the snowboard kept rolling and it's getting bigger and bigger and this is how the Chinese economy became addicted to debt and now I've probably got an idea of what you're thinking. Stupid private companies, right? Well, not exactly.

Speaker 3:          08:35          More than half of the bank debt in China consists of loans from state owned banks to state owned enterprises.

Speaker 1:          08:41          Wait just a second because there is so much more

Speaker 3:          08:48          Chinese banks, a weapon of mass.

Speaker 2:          08:52          We've

Speaker 1:          08:52          already seen how China is currently going, a debt overdose, but as if this wasn't enough, there is another danger hiding in the bushes back in the shadows. Banks face certain limitations on the amount of money they can loan, but Chinese banks have managed to skip these controls and in a way these banks have just copied what American banks were doing with them. Mortgages. Let me explain. Instead of just giving loans, they set up off balance companies that issued the debt that the banks then bought, and these surprise surprise, when you look at the banks accounts are not listed as loans that are rather as other investments. It's actually a pretty smart workaround, right? Well, it is estimated. The Chinese banks have hidden woven $2,000,000,000,000 and it has a straightforward consequence. Chinese banks can be way less solvent than their official numbers might indicate and besides much of this debt is opaque, so the actual Chinese desk could be much, much higher.

Speaker 1:          09:52          The vast spread of off balance activities and bank investment actually means a risk of hidden loans which could threaten China's financial security, shrunk fully in ex president of trainers, banking regulatory commission and weights because there's more a growing number of non bank financial firms also market their own wealth management products and invest the money with little disclosure of where the money goes. That's right in the last few years. Those companies at which get money from people to make investments that are risky and as opaque as become more and more popular as well. Why is that? Well, it's obviously because they're going to get higher rates of return with those investments. The thing is that this craving for loans has caused quite a bit of indigestion. This is a risk that the government is admitted and it has tried to limit company loans, but since there are a lot of unsold ghost towns, empty houses and bankruptcy, real estate agencies, the government has told the banks in the last few years to give away loans as if there was no tomorrow because, well, the family debt level is still so low that economists note that China's mortgage loans increased by 35 percent in 2016 and now you might be beginning to see why some analysts a warning that if they don't stop this debt vortex, China could become a new Japan, a country that has been in crisis since the 1980.

Speaker 1:          11:13          There is still more because now we know why she jinping and China need globalization quite so much. Air companies need foreign markets to deal with all of the debt that they have issues. Boston, not everything is all doom and gloom in the future. Well, it's still to come in China. The savings rates are still high, high enough, the foreign capital to arrive in the country.

Speaker 1:          11:38          That's. That is a risk and Moody's has given the first warning. Now it's the time that the government to start working to make reforms, and now, well, we'd love to know your thoughts. You can tell us what you think in this survey as well as in the comments below this video. What do you think will happen in China? Do you think that stagnation?
