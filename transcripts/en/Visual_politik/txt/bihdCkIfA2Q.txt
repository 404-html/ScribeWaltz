Speaker 1:          00:08          It's the world's largest population, the second largest economy. It has one of the largest multicurrency reserves, the second largest military budget, the number one trade power globally, but it's better known as the world's factory. These are just a few of the reasons that China has become a superpower. Now, if you're a regular viewer of visual politic, you'll know that we've done several videos on this country. We've discussed it's foreign policy, it's debt issues. We've discussed how it's companies have grown all around the world as well as its political system. We've discussed the Macau or Hong Kong. Suffice to say, we've talked a lot about

Speaker 2:          00:42          no

Speaker 1:          00:48          and we have done so because we believe that nowadays it is impossible, but as well as pretty inconvenient to discuss international politics without keeping in mind this huge global player are there. In all of those previous videos, you could say that we've skipped a really important question and that question is really, how powerful is China today? Well, the good news is that's exactly the question we're going to be answering in this video and we're going to do it from three different perspectives, military, economic and political, and look, even though many people's date, think of China as the second most important global power. Not everyone agrees with this, not at all. In fact, some experts believe that when China potential is carefully examined, well, it's not actually all that powerful, but then again, there are plenty of other experts. You stated that Chinese power is growing at an incredibly fast rate and that the 21st century is most certainly going to be China's century.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Now, before we get started, we should establish one thing first and that's what exactly do we mean by power? Is it to have a lot of economic resources and what about a big army or maybe it's actually to do with natural resources? Well, social scientists consider political power to be found in leverage and influence. That is essentially saying the power is the ability to shape and condition the events and actions of others. So the question now becomes, what is China's power? What do they have in order to leverage and influence other countries? Well, as I said a moment ago, in this video, we're going to examine the three main areas that most often deliver that power, and that's weapons, economics and politics bands. Well, how about we kick things off with war dragons strength?

Speaker 1:          02:33          Yeah. It isn't exactly easy to quantify anything military strength of a country. It depends on several different factors. You have to consider how well protected the country is. If its soldiers are well trained on how modern it's arsenal is, as well as a whole bunch of other factors. However, despite these different factors, we can still say the spending on defense is usually the best way to measure the military potential of a nation further. When we analyze the money a country spends on its army, we also get some other relevant information like how important is a strong military? It's the governments.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          03:07          According to the official figures in 2016, China spent around $146,000,000,000 on defense, but as you can probably imagine, China's government is not a shiny example of transparency in some of the sources. Indicate is that the number could be closer to 226 billion anyway, whichever number is correct. We do know that China has multiplied it's defense spending by five in the last decade and it is today the second largest spending country in the world when it comes to defense spending, trailing only behind the United States. Of course, five times though it's a significant increase in such a short period of time. However, this hasn't been disproportionately compared to the country's GDP. Indeed spending has been closely related to the economic growth of the country having been kept within two percent of the overall GDP. That is not the end of it. If we look at the public budget, we can see how defense expenses have dropped from 12 percent of the public spending in 2001 to a listen more than six percent in 2016. And can you guess what that means? Well, it means that China has made less of an effort when it comes to spending than the US. When you consider GDP and public spending as reference points. So take a look at this chart. For instance,

Speaker 1:          04:29          we already know two things. First, the Chinese military spending will keep growing at the same level of the economy does, which will gradually shrink that difference with the US seconds. We know that military spending is only a small bird into the Chinese economy. We could say it is a sustainable amounts, and if the government needed to reduce it, the governments could manage to do so without too many problems. However, it's now important that we talk about military capability because when it comes to Chinese military power, rob, certain limitations, the dragon lacks dryness potential to you. Operate military force outside of their borders is actually pretty low. Unlike the United States, China does not have any military bases abroad, with the exception of Djibouti, as we will see you later on. It also doesn't have that many allies, a verb already logistic network or satellites for launch deployments. That actually doesn't have much at all and then you must consider that there are also pretty inexperienced. I mean it's been 40 years since the last time Chinese troops engaged in.

Speaker 2:          05:28          That's what

Speaker 1:          05:31          does that mean that China is some sort of paper tiger? Well, no, absolutely not. New resources are allowing Beijing to make important changes and investments. China's growing military potential has changed the balance of forces in Asia and the People's Liberation Army is now capable of conducting operations on a global scale. China is making changes. They have reduced their military by 300,000 soldiers since 2015 and so focused on the military upgrades and their ability to operate abroad. The Chinese army opened its first for a military base in July of 2017 in the African country of Djibouti. Then in 2012 trying to bolt it's first aircraft carrier from Ukraine and in 2017 they completed their first to domestic carry up with more to follow is also investing in missiles and it's air force has put into service. It's new generation 20 stealth fighter. Yes, it is going to take decades at a minimum for the Chinese army to come clips to the American army, but there is certainly no other country out that with as much potential as China, we all better get used to having to deal with China.

Speaker 1:          06:36          We're talking about global military strategy, the economic power. There is no way to sustain any political or military power without economic capacity, but there's more to it than that. Economic power has its own great potential to influence other governments and large companies and this is what is happening. For instance, with direct foreign investments, which is both entering and leaving China as a pure financial figure amount. This is not actually very hydrus yes, but year after year, this figure has grown and grown. In a previous visual politic video we looked at is how in the last few years Chinese companies have started to invest money around the world in 2016, excluding Hong Kong and Macau. This amount was more than $180 million dollars. Thanks to this. China is gaining influence, especially in developing countries that have seen quite the opportunity in this Chinese, yeah,

Speaker 2:          07:34          money and just

Speaker 1:          07:41          the same sort of thing with trades, but he had trying to raise by far the leading global power and we're not just talking about Chinese exports here. We're talking about imports a lot to pay attention here because Chinese economic growth has created a more prosperous middle class everyday. More than a hundred and 80,000 people leave poverty behind and become a part of the middle class that has enough money to well spent and it's this view is something that has caused many multinationals to make China. Then number one priority. That is certainly the case of BMW where one out of every four cars sold by this company is sold in China. A country where sales and about 50 percent larger than in the United States, but there's still more Asian assembly lines occupying several countries. For example, Vietnam, they produce one components while the another is made in South Korea and later they are all assembled in China. Vi welds, great production center in the Asia Pacific region to hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on trade with China, but not everything looks so good. There are problems too, especially when it comes to technology, design and innovation because well, truth be told, innovation and creativity usually get on with dictatorships, but still things are changing and investment trade and multinationals are all things that generate a lot of influence in

Speaker 1:          09:11          growing political power. That is political power. It's often said that China lacks leadership and further, that's like the US, which counseling solid allies all around the world. China is some sort of lone wolf. Now, this has been said for years, but do keep in mind that this is all beginning to change. China has bet on increasing their influence on global politics and is doing that to defend interests that are increasingly global.

Speaker 1:          09:41          Plan a strategy, the Chinese are using that large currency reserves to expand their influence. In the last decade alone, Beijing has loaned money to several governments and has invested all over the world from Fiji to Madagascar, and that is not the end of it. They've also set up ambitious plans to achieve their goals. As an example, the Asian infrastructure investment bank, a financial power controlled by China in based in Beijing will reduce the influence of institutions like the World Bank, the IMF or the Asian Development Bank. All of them controlled by Washington to some extent. And how about some more examples? Well, there's the new silk roads, the one road, one belt, the largest infrastructure project in the world. Then there is the China Investment Corporation, a sovereign funds that managers more than $800,000,000,000 and invests in companies all around the world. And yes, we didn't make a mistake there. That is billion with a b. So now you might be wondering, How's China actually had any political success with this strategy? Well, the answer is yes, they have and that is well demonstrated in the country of Greece. China is developing enormous projects in this country, like the portal, the Hellinikon, they sort of Monaco in the heart,

Speaker 2:          10:51          the baffin.

Speaker 1:          10:57          What's the result of all this wild? Last June, Athens vetoed a resolution that condemns the violation of rights in China and it's not for the first time anyway. China is still facing real challenges. Perhaps the biggest of these is it's aging population. I mean, just have a look at this.

Speaker 2:          11:12          Awesome. Despite

Speaker 1:          11:17          this, the influence of China and international politics will grow quite a lot in the next few years and China is already a new superpower as well. That's our opinion at visual politic and now we'd love to know yours.
