Speaker 1:          00:00          Yep. He has got an image problem for years. This gigantic country, the second most populated in all of Africa with almost a hundred million inhabitants with a synonym for extreme poverty, hunger, disease, war in short, true misery. However, in the new century, everything began to change. Even though Ethiopia is still a very poor country in the last decade, it has become one of the fastest growing economies, not only in Africa but in the world at the same time. It has grown very close to Beijing and has also become a close ally of the United States in the fight against terrorism. Why half face single friendship if you can have both. The fact is that we're probably witnessing nothing more or less because I'm the birth of a future African power and that's more than enough reason to ensure that we hear on visual politic don't want to miss what's happening in a country that many are already calling the new African China. So listen up after decades of tension, hostility and confrontation before ends, after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 on July the ninth of 2018 both countries signed a declaration for peace and we should remember that during this long confrontation, they were tragic moments. Indeed, the military conflicts between 98 and 2000 kills nearly a hundred thousand people. Now, the leaders of both countries, they've agreed to sign for complete peace.

Speaker 2:          01:41          We had agreed to resume the services of our airlines to get our ports working, to get our people to trade and to open our embassies again. There is no longer a border between Eritrea and Ethiopia because of bridge of love has destroyed it. I be on that Ethiopia's prime minister,

Speaker 1:          01:57          but of course the question remains what has led these two countries to suddenly like each other so much? Well, my friends, even though it may seem incredible, one of the problems that prevented reconciliation was this village that you see on the screen now. It's bothering me and it's a place where there's practically nothing at all. And do you see based on the peace agreements that were negotiated in our g as in the year 2000 to ends, the last war, this territory belongs to Eritrea. In the end, the Ethiopian government realize that this didn't work for them, so those peace agreements didn't really go anywhere until the now, now Ethiopia, the stronger country between the two, after all, we're talking about a hundred million people against just over 5 million they've decided to give up because if you are on many occasions persisting just to look stronger is a mistake. That's bad for everyone. There's nothing to gain and there's a great deal to lose in any case of this piece is a good reflection of the changes that are taking place and is not because this might surprise you.

Speaker 3:          03:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Chinese model, recent years, Ethiopia has the calm one of the fastest growing economies on the planet. During the last decade, Ethiopia has averaged a growth rate of around 10% per year. For example, check out the following graphic here. We can compare Ethiopia's GDP growth per capita with that of another rapidly growing country, Vietnam and watch our, because Ethiopia's population is huge and as we're talking here about GDP per capita, but the hold on a moment, we're not just talking about the economy. As you can imagine, all of this growth has led to some important social consequences, which is something that sooner or later always happens when a country grows, opens up to the world and does things right. Since the year 2000 the average life expectancy has increased by 13 years, the number of workers with at least a completed secondary education has grown by almost 50% it's poverty. Well, look at what's happening with poverty.

Speaker 3:          04:20          Yup.

Speaker 1:          04:20          I know even today there is a lot of poverty in Ethiopia with a simple google search. We can find terrible situations in this country, but folks, let's be clear. Overcoming poverty isn't something that happens overnight. I mean, I wish it was that easy, but it's not. In any case, how does ABB above that country's capital is a good reflection of the process that Ethiopia is experiencing? Cranes works and projects of all kinds are absolutely flooding the city. In fact, it was here in this city that their first light subway in sub Saharan Africa was inaugurated in 2015 yeah. Course. Having reached this point, the question that we must ask is, well, how on earth has Ethiopia achieved such an economic leap? What we can say that this country has become something like Beijing's outstanding. Okay, great. There's largely been led by essentially copying the Asian giants. See, on the one hand, the Ethiopian government has promoted the construction of enormous infrastructure projects that are essential for the country's development. We're speaking, for example, all of a railway line, the cost more than $4 billion in connected Santa's Salbaba with the Djibouti port to facilitate and merchandise exports or the greatest projects in all of Africa. The Grand Ethiopian renascence. Damn. This is a John Dam on the Nile River that requires an investment of around $6 billion and his mission with soup revolutionize the country's energy system with abundance and cheap electricity.

Speaker 1:          05:49          By the way, do you know who gave the investment and the knowledge for these projects? Well. Tony, those of you who followed this channel regularly won't be surprised. To a large extent. It was China and Chinese company. In fact, China has become, Ethiopia hasn't biggest investor and trading partner. In other words, a large part of the country's growth has been due to its ties with China. The second pillar of Ethiopia's growth is that little by Netapp, large state owned companies began to operate with more autonomy and managed to themselves almost as if they were private companies. This is the case for example of Ethiopian Airlines, the country's flagship carrier, which has become the largest African airline and it's now in, tends to compete internationally with the Nigga style lines in the industry. Even though Ethiopian Airlines is a hundred percent state owned, it's run like a business. The board runs it as if it's British Airways or United Airlines, Zuma, denon nuggets, chairman of Fairfax, Africa Fund Llc, and finally the third pillar thi attraction of foreign direct investment through the development of economic zones, fiscal incentives, participative financing, et cetera. Take a look at how foreign investments have evolved. This is how Ethiopia has begun to industrialize largely because of these policies, and also thanks to the cost of labor and industry that has grown a lot in recent years has been textiles. In fact, brands such as h and m guest, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein already produced some of that governments in this country, but unfortunately that's not all that similarities with China aren't limited to the economic part.

Speaker 3:          07:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:42          At the same time that the country was experiencing an economic takeoff, does that repression of civil liberties became stronger and stronger. The media, it was broadly restricted. Political opposition was persecuted websites, blogs, et cetera. In recent years, this country became one of the 10 biggest journalist, jailers, and the entire wealth. Ethiopian government virtually locks up, forced into exile or intimidated almost every independent journalist. In other words, Ethiopia practically reached a situation in which there were no journalists, only government spokesman, but folks, hold on a moment because now suddenly it looks like everything has the gun to change. Listen Up. A new generation beginning of 2018 Ethiopia was mired in a way of a violence, racial clashes and political repression that was threatening the country stability with absolute collapse.

Speaker 4:          08:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:42          And although economically things have worked out quite well in recent years, there have been some imbalances are rather large foreign debt and great shortage of foreign currency. As a result of large investments in population growth and very high, you found employment rates. Indeed, many were wondering if what if eop or had gone through in recent years have been nothing but a mirage. However, against all odds, after a high power struggle, the ruling Party v Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front in practice, the only party elected Prime Minister Abe Akhmed, a 42 year old former army officer. Not much was expected, but within just a few months, boom. Things have changed.

Speaker 1:          09:22          You see you since he came to power. Akhmed has released many political prisoners. He has apologized for the government abuses. He's announced senior officials of the intelligence services and the security forces for having committed state at terrorism. He's promoted the peace agreement with Eritrea. He's announced her modifications to the constitution to establish the limitation of mandate and he's begun to dismantle the political censorship and asked xcel journalists to return to the country Ethiopia unblocks 264 websites and TV channels, and not only that, he has also announced that the government will deepen the liberalization of the economy to attract more investments to the country if you'll be open this door to the world with unprecedented privatization plan. Of course, as you can imagine, all of these things haven't been great for the country's elite since their answer. It didn't take long to come. If you'll be in pm escapes, grenade attack, one dead scores hurt on June the 23rd 2018 during a political events in the heart of Addis Ababa in which the president wore a Nelson Mandela tee shirts. Some trying to put an end to his political transition. However they failed and now the prime minister knows that he has to step on the accelerator.

Speaker 3:          10:32          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:32          Ethiopia dear is, it's still a very poor country that has many problems, political, social and economic. However, the country, not long ago, it was considered the most miserable country on earth. Now seems to have an opportunity to take off. So will it do so well any time you can answer this question.
