Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:08          He's a politician, but he's not just any politician. His biography is what you'd expect from the protagonist of a best selling political fiction novel. However, the viewer, this is a flesh and blood politician with both the good side and the dark side. We're talking about Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, and it's the most powerful politician in the country has had in the last two decades.

Speaker 3:          00:30          This is a country that works. People work the invent things, and when things that change live, this is past is future. Yes, I found in the Times that I've been in government that the most rapid technology transfers occur when businesses operate within Israel is often called the startup nation. I call it the innovation nation. The future belongs to those who innovate. Those who don't innovate rather than companies or in countries will fall behind. Innovation is the only way to consistently add value to your products and services in an increasingly competitive global economy.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Bye. You may be wondering, why are we talking about Netanyahu today? Why is he so important? Well, folks, what if I told you that this man was the architect? He basically designs the Israel that we know today. Yes, you heard that, right? We're talking about a politician who has so much character that he actually attacked the very presidents of the United States in front of his own congress. Yes, indeed. This happened to Barack Obama, so don't tell me that this guy isn't

Speaker 3:          01:43          huff before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that you long to do three things. First, stop. It's aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second, stopped supporting terrorism around the world, and third, stop threatening you are nine late my country, Israel. The one and only

Speaker 1:          02:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:12          fact is that Benjamin Netanyahu or bibby as is known in Israel, done practically everything in his country during his time as a soldier. And remember here, the military service is mandatory in Israel. He commanded a special forces unit, antibiotic [inaudible] and plenty of operations which have names liquid you'd see in a Hollywood movie, names like operation in Ferno hands operation, a tape where by the way, ness and Yahoo was shot while his unit rescue to plane hijacked by the terrorist group, the Black September organization.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Look, I'm 28 years old. I've had to defend my country in two wars and in many battles

Speaker 2:          02:48          as a soldier. He also participated in operations in Egypt, Syria and Jordan.

Speaker 2:          02:55          That's not all. After finishing his military service, this prime minister went to the United States to study as well. Now you might be wondering, well where did he study? Well first it was mit and then it was Harvard and by the way, here's some curious trivia. In 1973 when the Yom Kippur war broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Netanyahu who was studying in Boston returned home to rejoin the special forces until the war ended. But moving on from Trivia, that's continued. The fact is that after studying in the United States and spending some time working in consulting, he got involved in politics where again, he's done everything. He has been a member of parliaments and Ambassador to the UN Minister of foreign affairs, Minister of finance, and of course prime minister for four towns. In fact, my friends, he's about to become the Israeli prime minister with the longest time in office. However, now his position of influence and power is being questions. So let's take a look at what is happening or why this man is an election winning machine

Speaker 4:          04:01          cornered

Speaker 2:          04:05          on February the 12th 2018 after a year of investigations, the Israeli police recommended the attorney general bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu. You see the police state there are clear indications of corruption, bribes, and influence peddling. They accused the prime minister of having received gifts of hundreds of thousands of dollars of having good spires do influence the media and also of having protected millionaire corruption in the multimillion dollar process of buying German submarines.

Speaker 2:          04:37          And do you know what? This isn't the first time that Israel is, police have accused him. They also did it in 1997 and again in 1999 during that and Yahoo's first term as prime minister back then the accusations ended with no charges. And now again, the prime minister has made it very clear that he will not yield nothing. We'll have sway and nothing will sway me. Not even the incessant attacks against me, Benjamin Netanyahu. The truth is that whether or not he's finally accused. Netanyahu is on the line. By the way it Israel, nobody is immune to justice. In the last decades they have condemned and the prison's a former prime minister, accurate almost has an ex presidents, Moshe Katsav. So if Fidessa Yard, he was guilty and he's got a pain. Therefore it, if you were in this video, we're going to get to know Israelis, prime minister besser. We're going to take a look. It is good and his bad side and investigates what made an and Yahoo is such an important character in Israel's politics. He beebe the savior. Listen, you're, we might not be the most popular guy on the planets, but one thing is absolutely certain. Every time bibby has come to power, he's done. So I was a very, very difficult conditions.

Speaker 5:          05:55          Sure. During

Speaker 2:          05:55          his first term when he came to power 1996 the country was greatly unbalanced with an uncontrolled public and deficits and growing external debt. In 2003 when he was appointed minister of finance under aerial Sharon's governments. If the country was undergoing its worst recession and the most current time was in 2009 just when his country was suffering the consequences of the greater international financial crisis. Well, in all these cases, Netanyahu's recipes they works. And not only that, with his policies, pity has transformed this country's identity. Thanks largely to his governance. Israel has gone from being a place with chronic imbalances and crises. A country, there's, in 1984 had to be rescued by the United States to becoming a prosperous country with well organized accounts and say worldwide power in technology and innovation. Through all this, we can understand how despite all the controversy maybe continues to raise passions, some against him, but many in favor of him, but many of you might not be thinking, okay, but what, where? Or rather, what are Benjamin Netanyahu's recipes? While that's exactly what we're going to look at next. Traditionally Israel was a socialist country with high taxes, a lot of regulation, and a very large governments. Well, they're these mission was to change this model once and for all and in force another that would organize the accounts and improve the country's competitive dust. I mean, check this out. You think that

Speaker 6:          07:25          mathematicians and computer engineers or mechanical engineers or doctors or first they're very important, but they're not first, they're second. There was a country that had the best mathematicians, the best physicists, the best metallurgists in the world, but that country was very poor. It was called the Soviet Union. What comes first is markets. This was the main thing that I tried to bring to the Israeli economy in my own way. Benjamin Netanyahu

Speaker 2:          07:50          with this idea in mind and its first mandate in 1996 is number one priority was to reduce the public deficits. Privatized banks and large government owned companies and suppress capital controls. For example, at that time, Israelis had a restriction on the money that they could take out of the country and to use for buying foreign currency. Yes, we could say that the Israel of the nineties resembled the coaching is Argentina, a lot of public spending and capital controls, but let's continue. In 2003 when the country was undergoing a terrible crisis as minister of finance, Minister of Finance with a lot of power. By the way, Netanyahu froze public spending and launched a huge tax reduction. For example, he reduced corporate income tax as well as individual income tax by half. See, when he arrived at the ministry, the maximum rate on income in terms of wages was 64% when he left, it was 44% a 20 point reduction in just two years and when he came to power in 2009 he had a similar recipe that's public spending, fewer taxes and less. In addition, in recent years, he managed to get Israel once and for all to exploit its huge natural gas reserves.

Speaker 6:          09:06          Israel bolsters Egypt ties with $15 billion gas deal.

Speaker 2:          09:11          It was precisely because of this that many believe Israel is miracle would not have been possible without this prime minister, but don't think that he has only had good results in the economic sector, not at all

Speaker 6:          09:22          in the 37 months that Netanyahu held office Israeli citizens enjoyed or one of the safest and quietest periods with regards to terrorism. Of the five is really leaders examined Robin Perez, Netanyahu, Brock Sharone, Netanyahu's policies with regards to the prevention and deterrence of terrorism where the most effective

Speaker 2:          09:43          indeed in addition to the economy, Israeli society recognizes net and Yahoo has having made Israel a safer country. I save the country and also very importantly the country that is much more open to the world. So much so that this prime minister has succeeded. And this is not here because I think this will amaze you in getting relations between Israel and the Arab countries to go smoothly. And this is something that we certainly need to dive more into man. What do that right now,

Speaker 6:          10:16          external approach.

Speaker 2:          10:20          So you probably know the popular saying my enemy's enemy is my friend. Well, it looks as if something like this is happening in the Middle East with Iran and to with fundamentalist groups like Isis. I mean check all the news that the New York Times published on February the third 2018

Speaker 6:          10:36          secret alliance is real carries out air strikes in Egypt with Kairos. Okay. Pay Close attention to this new spot.

Speaker 2:          10:45          In the last two years, Israel has carried out more than a hundred area. The tax with planes, helicopters and drones against fundamentalist groups in Egypt's, particularly against the so called Islamic state of Sinai that is an Arab governments. In this case, the Egyptian government has authorized Israel to carry out attacks and operations within its territory, which is really quite amazing, but that's not all. Israel's relations with Jordan and Egypt are better than ever, but they're also growing stronger with other Arab countries including Saudi Arabia. Yep. You heard that rise. Now they still aren't formal but they are happening behind closed doors.

Speaker 6:          11:17          There is an alignment of Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been on imaginable 10 years ago. Certainly in my lifetime I never saw anything like it. And I met the age of the state of Israel have more or less. So it's an extraordinary thing.

Speaker 2:          11:31          So how about another example? Well after 70 years of prohibition and for the first time Saudi Arabia has authorized in Israeli commercial flight to cross it's ass space since March Air India flights between New Delhi and Tel Aviv. Well cross Saudi ass space. This might seem like a small step but it's written not and you know what? It's not just the Arab countries. The prime minister has set his sights on the and there's also establish surprisingly good relations with India, Australia, Singapore and even China.

Speaker 3:          11:59          We are very much very much excited by the belt and road initiative and what we feel is merely an express lane. This belt and road that is called the China is going to relations

Speaker 2:          12:13          and once more that's in Yahoo led the first visit of an Israeli prime minister to Latin America in 2017 he visited Mexico. Columbia and sergeants has an Africa. Wow. Smart.

Speaker 3:          12:32          Israel is coming back to Africa and Africa is coming back to Israel.

Speaker 1:          12:40          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:43          In fact, that's in Yahoo was the first Israeli needed to visit this consonant since the 1960s and many African leaders aren't delighted with Israel's money and Israel's technology.

Speaker 1:          12:51          Jake,

Speaker 2:          12:53          diversity and richness. I saw passion and productivity. I saw a young African entrepreneurs who are building companies, harnessing the power of the digital age. Africans are seizing the future. Israel wants to seize this future with you. In short, as you can see you both in the economic field as well as insecurity and foreign policy. There's prime minister as many reasons to be proud, but of course not. Everything is a bed of roses here.

Speaker 1:          13:24          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:25          Dark side.

Speaker 1:          13:28          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:29          We just announced it before on visual politic. One of the greatest problems we see with Benjamin Netanyahu in addition to his corruption suspicions, is his position towards the West Bank settlements. Yes. And that's in Yahoo supports these settlements, continual growth. And as we saw in recent years, this government has promoted to policy to expand and consolidate them, and it's more than three years in power. This government has been irrational, bordering on the messianic does now increasingly clear where it is headed. Creeping annexation of the West Bank aimed at precluding any permanent separation from the Palestinians who barack former prime minister of Israel. And besides these settlements, Netanyahu's power relations with some magnates a raw, so Ashley put it questionable. For example, his friends and gambling mogul Sheldon Adelson invested $200 million into Israel high on a free newspaper that greatly favors net in the yard.

Speaker 1:          14:21          Hi,

Speaker 2:          14:23          a question that arises is what you have to return the favor and other significance. Parts of Netanyahu's dark side has to do with his way of doing politics is a tough opponent who has no qualms about attacking his rivals through all possible means. That is precisely what he did in 1995 with prime minister. It's soccer robyn, who he accused among many other things of portraying Jewish values, potentially need generated, were so great that many detractors blame him for the hatred that ended with Robin's murder at the hands of an extremist. His critics say that Netanyahu didn't pull the trigger, but that is a lack of political piety that to the tragedy.

Speaker 2:          15:03          So that Divya is the end of this video about a politician who has a dark side, but also a very bright one as well. He has contributed to making Israel a much more prosperous country, but now it's your turn. What do you think of Benjamin Netanyahu, do you think can bibby has been a good leader for Israel?
