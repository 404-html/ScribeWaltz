Speaker 1:          00:08          European Union, it's sort of like the windows of politics that slow. It doesn't work perfectly and sometimes it just crashes nonetheless. Let us be honest. The other alternatives are not much better. Ams consistently be more costly at the beginning of this year. It seems like the far right was

Speaker 2:          00:26          stackable.

Speaker 1:          00:29          Some political analysts claims that brexit would be the beginning of the end for the European Union, and during this time the international media was full of words like frexit or checks it out. Either this year or skeptic fierro wasn't a last for long. Francis elected a brand new president, Emmanuel Macron, who stands up for the European Union like no one else. The same has happened in other elections around Europe. In other words, the European Union is alive and kicking at least for the next four years, but to do, hold on for just a minute because things are more complex than what they might seem. In fact, norms. All EU fans are the same as many of them don't even share the same opinion on what the EU should be. For instance, the Crohn's stands for a fiscal union with the same taxes in every country. Geneva, Angela Merkel, nausea into that. On the other hands that you formed the Belgium Prime Minister Abe Verhofstadt, who is now president of the European Liberal Party, says that Europe should become a federation like the United States. Does everyone agree with that? Well, the answer is rather unsurprisingly, no. In fact, the only thing shared by all these politicians is the fact that the EU is a good thing,

Speaker 1:          01:46          but now the questions are, well, what is the European Union all about? What should it become? Is it a federation or a confederation? Ends? What are the different models on the negotiation table? Well, today we are going to answer all of these questions. Margaret Thatcher was right. Margaret township is something like Elvis Presley to euro skeptics for decades. This woman who was the British prime minister in the 19 eighties has it become the biggest inspiration for many of the movements that want to end the European project, but then again, reality is seldom simple. Now, it is true that Margaret Thatcher was a big critic of political integration back in the time the European Union still didn't exist. There was just a community of countries that traded among themselves. Nevertheless, during the 19 eighties, different European governments agreed to deepen this interview.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Gracious is

Speaker 1:          02:47          when they started talking about a single currency and you institutions. All of this culminated in 1992 with the signing of the master x treaty, but the question is, what's it Margaret Thatcher think about all of this? Well, the truth is if we forget about stereotypes and we actually read her memoir, we find quotes like this,

Speaker 3:          03:06          just not dream of some cozy, isolated existence on the fringes of the European community. Our destiny is in Europe as part of the

Speaker 1:          03:17          importantly. This doesn't mean that that shit was in total agreements with all the European politicians. She just wanted a different model. Unlike Lucy wanted to United States of Europe with the capital of Brussels, she stood for a confederate.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Certainly

Speaker 3:          03:33          we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose, but it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one's home going, we've got to explain what's the difference between a federation and a confederation. An example of a federation would be the United States of America, Texas and California have their own legislatures, their own governments and their own laws. Today, for instance, marijuana is legal in California, but illegal in Texas. However, if the congress in Washington DC were to pass a law legalizing cannabis across the country, any state law that would contradict the federal one would be automatic.

Speaker 1:          04:18          We abolished in the confederation that states have way more autonomy today. There are actually no confederations in the world, not even in Switzerland. Of course, in Switzerland, the different kansans enjoy a loss of autonomy and different taxes, but that doesn't mean they are a confederation. For instance, if the parliaments of burner would pass a law legalizing marijuana, the rest of the cousins would have to accept

Speaker 2:          04:39          yes.

Speaker 1:          04:44          Switzerland was a real confederation. Each of the different assemblies would have to have a vote to decide whether they want to keep cannabis legal or not. So despite what a lot of people say, Switzerland is clearly a federation and so now you might be wondering, well, what exactly is a Europe then? Is it a federation or a confederation? Of course there are lots of people who stand for the federal model. In the last few years, the champion of this idea has been the president of the Liberals Diva hotstats that we need to be formed Europe to make it a real federation capable to act not only on in the economic field, but also by establishing the defense union by establishing a European investigation capacity. But let's go back to the facts today. Despite what it looks like, national governments have a lot of autonomy. For instance, years ago, Brussels, past the directive, banning smoking in bars. After that, each of the member countries have to vote on their own anti tobacco law, men's well, you know what happens? Well, Australia and the Czech Republic did not pass those laws, and during those years you could smoke in the cafes of Prague and Vienna Wall in Berlin and Paris. It was completely forbidden.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Vat, which is the main European tax is different in each country. In Spain they a 21 percent, but in hungry they paid 27 percent times. In Germany they've got a 19 percent tax. In other words, Europe is not a federation, but it's also not a confederation either. It's kind of a federal confederation and now you're probably wondering, is this federal confederation model actually working or do we need to move ahead with some sort of United States of Europe

Speaker 1:          06:26          wrong in the European Union? We all have heard about the many mistakes this European integration has made, but the truth is many of these floors could have happened in the member states individually. As an example. Let us have a look at the refugee crisis. Now. It is true that Brussels was incapable of crafting a common policy to give asylum to all the citizens that are running away from countries like Syria, Iraq or Libya. But let's not lie to ourselves. The same happens in every single country. In Spain, for example, the national government did everything they could to avoid welcoming the refugees on the other hands. Madrid city hall did the exact opposite. City Hall of Madrid will make a welcoming project so the refugees will have a place to live. In other words, we cannot expect to Brussels to solve the problems that nation states have always had in politics. Such things. They're simply not possible. But do you hold on for a moment because this does not mean the European Union is perfect either. In fact, there are many problems that are endemic to this incident.

Speaker 1:          07:28          For example, let's imagine you are a freelance and living in Hungary and you work for a company based in Belgium. Should you include Vat on the invoice that you said to them? Well, according to EU legislation, you shouldn't because while it's a service contract, but each country has its own tax laws that in many cases contradicts the EU laws. But not only that, what Vat should you include on that invoice? The Hungarian one more. The Belgium one. All these problems. Could be solved if there was a common ground on taxation matters. Let's many countries don't want to lose sovereignty on this matter and no one does make the first step towards. So as you might imagine from this, it's pretty hard for important decisions to move forward. So the question is, what could be the solution to this problem club with different kinds of members? Constitution, they are useful. They allow politicians and legislators to know what they can do and what they can't. It's sort of like a minimal agreements this way a government knows what it can pass as a law and it's a system that has been proven effective

Speaker 2:          08:38          so

Speaker 1:          08:38          well. What's the problem? Well, old attempts to release a European constitution have failed in 2005. Both France and the Netherlands had referendums where they rejected the proposal for a European magna Carta years later, Brussels politicians, matt again to write a new version of this constitution, these so called Lisbon Treaty. This was a milder version of the previously drafted constitution. That's integration problems persisted, but truth is that each country has its own interests and it's hard to get them all on the same page, so why not just recognize the differences, and this is why the European Commission has made the European Whitesburg where they imagined by you've potential scenarios for you. One of them would allow each state to have a different level of integration.

Speaker 3:          09:24          On the other hand, at the beginning of 2017, the economist proposed to create a European Union with different kinds of memberships of one hand, there would be a premium member who would share a common currency, common fiscal policy and a common foreign policy. On another one, there would be a silver member would just share a common market and the free movement area. Other members, let's call them the bronze category, would have access to just the comment

Speaker 2:          09:47          market.

Speaker 3:          09:49          This way, it would be way easier to convince every country to pass a European constitution.

Speaker 1:          09:54          In the meantime, the idea of a United States of Europe, it's lost a lot of support supporters. The idea of a Europe with different membership levels, however, currently enjoys a lot of stuff. Meanwhile, Francis brand new president is willing to play a major role in the future of Europe, but what does he really stands for? Well, we're not answering that in this video, but if you'd like to know more about Emmanuel Macron, don't forget to check out this video that we need.

Speaker 1:          10:21          So now our question to you is, do you think this hybrid of a federal confederation with different men, but categories can actually work? Or should we keep trying?
