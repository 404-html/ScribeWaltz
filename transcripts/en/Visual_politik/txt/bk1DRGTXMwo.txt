Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          Kuwait's is alone with guitar, the only country in the Arabian peninsula where elections are hells. Yep. You heard that right? Many of you might know this country because of the oil reserves that wealth, all the facts that they were invaded by Saddam Hussein in the 90s but Kuwait is much more than that. It is one of the most tolerant nations in the Islamic world's women can vote. They can run for office and they even have a female

Speaker 1:          00:33          paint

Speaker 2:          00:38          lots and all of these apps. For decades, the Kuwaiti royal family has been America's best friends in the Gulf. This is why when they were invaded in 1990 uncle Sam didn't hesitate for a moment and sent in their troops immediately.

Speaker 3:          00:51          This will not stand. This will not stand this aggression against a Kuwait.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Now you might wonder, why are we talking today about Kuwait? Well, this is the only Arab country alongside a man that hasn't joined the diplomatic of block of Qatar.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:10          Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates broke off relations with Qatar in the worst diplomatic crisis to hit the Gulf Arab states in decades. The three Gulf countries and Egypt accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region and now the big question is why is Kuwait is not on this list of nations who have cut ties with Qatar? What kind of interest and does this country have in this diplomatic crisis? How does that been? This has to work well today. We are going to answer these questions before we do. Let's get to know a bit more about this particular part of the planet. Ooh, in the Persian Gulf, the first country we need to know about in the Arabian peninsula is Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the biggest country in the region, both in terms of population and territory, but it is not the only

Speaker 1:          02:02          country. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:05          yeah. We have for United Arab Emirates, which Dubai and Abu Dhabi are a part of. This country has its own government, its own laws and its own currency and this absolutely independent from the Saudis. The same goes for Qatar, which has its own foreign policy and holds better public relations with enemies of the Saudis like the Islamic Republic of Iran. And now you might be thinking that all of these countries have one important thing in common. The fact that they are all incredibly oil rich, right? Well, actually that's pretty wrong. Here we have the Republic of Yemen, a country that is extremely poor. Now of course it will if these countries have a common history, common traditions as well as religion, but make no mistake, each of them have their own peculiarities. For example, the United Arab Emirates was the first country who realized oil is not forever and therefore they decided to diversify their economy, so they accrued, represents just 3% of the total economy of Cuba is also a totally different animal. Yes, they have a monarchy, the so called apnea, but he is controlled buying eight constitution. The parliament. Well, hold on for just a second because this doesn't mean they are a 100% democratic country. In fact, their system, it's way more complicated than that. So, well that's, I'm looking at it now.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:39          Does semi democracy work in Kuwait? Kuwait is known as a semi democracy. I'm like Saudi Arabia. Kuwait has a freedom of religion. This is why you can even find a catholic church in the middle of Kuwait

Speaker 1:          03:51          City.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Things like the hit job on north mandatory and even the laws regarding alcohol. Beth fairly liberal in comparison with their neighbors. Of course it's still forbidden. Nz buy and sell alcohol, but it is legal to drink in privates. Nonetheless, the main peculiarity about Kuwait are their elections. All the adult natural born citizens have the right to vote their parliament every four years. This includes women in these elections. Political parties are

Speaker 1:          04:18          a bit, doesn't it

Speaker 2:          04:21          mean candidates have no ideology at all? They can also campaign freely and have debates. Needless to say, the political debate here is totally different compared to that in the UK or the u s yeah, the political spectrum is not only a right wing or left wing kind of thing. Of course some kinds of ads are highly conservative and others are more liberal and open. Z Western culture

Speaker 1:          04:41          sure

Speaker 2:          04:43          is not the only thing that divides Kuwaiti society. There is also this never ending fights between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. This is because, as I said before, that is freedom of religion and that means the creed of the candidates is as important as his tax plan. There's Mazzoni. That bear is a nother big divide between the so called urban voters am's, the so called tribal once. Just think about it for a moment. This is a country with a long nomadic tradition with half of the population still living in tribes and these tribes that own primaries to choose that own candles. Well said. Elections are used to choose a national assembly with the power to make laws and even put a veto on the policies taken by the executive branch. But now you might be wondering how old are the trees, the prime minister, all they voted for by mds as they do a European countries or do they hold presidential elections like they do in the US?

Speaker 4:          05:43          Sorry. Well

Speaker 2:          05:46          it's actually nothing like either of those. As I said, Kuwait is a semiotic democracy. This means that the head of state is the Amea and he chooses the prime minister and his, so maybe this sounds like those European. Absolutely. Monica is that you studied about in history lessons? Well, it's not really exactly like that. In fact, in Arab monarchies, the position of India is not inherited. This is why in Saudi Arabia they have big internal battles to choose their leaders and as I explained in a previous video, royal families in this part of the wells can have thousands of members.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Yes.

Speaker 2:          06:24          So in the case of Kuwait, the members of the royal family, the so called Al Subar House can vote for the EMEA, but right after the national assembly it has to vote on whether they can accept this decision or not. But it's a hold on now for just a second because just in case the system wasn't complicated enough. Here is another extra fact. The constitution allows the air to dissolve the parliaments many time he wants fans. Well that's something he does pretty often.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Amir

Speaker 2:          06:54          of Kuwait dissolves parliament. The move announced on state media after an emergency government meeting sets the stage for early elections. And believe me, parliamentary debates in Kuwait are far from being quiet. Emergency meetings are a common thing and sometimes it's really hard to get any kind of consensus. For some analysts. This is one of the reasons that explains this. The halakha economy, we all know oil rich countries have so much money they can spend as if there was no tomorrow, most natural born Qac citizens work on civil sevens for the governments. They pay no income tax, their energy bills and subsidized and best salary as well. Then neutrik Christie, yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Hi.

Speaker 2:          07:39          Do people who work on oil rigs? Well, they're the foreigners, but this is not only a rihanna see four key ways it happens all over the region like goals is allowed to, all of these countries do enjoy this way, right? The question is, well, what happens now, as you probably know, the market price for crude oil has fallen in recent years. Of course these oil Monica is are still making profits but not enough to keep that system going and this is why today all of these countries have fiscal deficits. This means they're spending is way higher than their income.

Speaker 1:          08:23          Hey

Speaker 2:          08:23          to the chart. Even the USA I come through, which is really worried about his deficits is doing better than these countries. I now you might wonder, what does this figure actually mean? Well, this means that if the Kuwaitis don't want to go bankrupt in just a few years, they better find some alternative incomes, not rely entirely on oil. Nonetheless, despite two ways, having the most to modern and democratic political system, they have the highest dependence on crude oil. Even Saudi Arabia regressive as they all is better prepared for a plummet in the price of oil, and this is a surprise for everybody because during the 1970s Kuwait was the Rockstar of the region. Now this title goes to Dubai despite it being an absolute monarchy and this is left him in. The Arab is wondering whether democracy is compatible with economics.

Speaker 1:          09:15          Cool.

Speaker 2:          09:20          Wait, has stagnated, frustrating the people of a country once seen as a Middle East trailblazer, let's say that you want to start a logistics company in Dubai. You just need to buy some land and build the facilities, right? Well, in Kuwait this is almost impossible. The government's owns 90% of the territory. On the other hand is bureaucracy as reached insane levels according to the world about in kids is easy to get to start a business in countries like Ukraine or El Salvador than it is in Qa.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Yes,

Speaker 2:          09:52          and all of this is despite the fact that Kuwait has a lower corporate tax rate of the Luxembourg added to this, all these sky high salaries of civil workers, which rise year after year, and you can probably imagine that no one is going to become an entrepreneur and to leave behind the comfort and safety of a government job to even the quiches and transfer the money outside because they cannot do business. They're taught to do the short term, the short term, but now all of a sudden the Qatari crisis has offered Kuwait a chance to emerge as a regional leader. Their royal house has good relationships with all the countries involved, including the United States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar plus step analytical system is the most open and democratic in the region. In other words, they have the best chance of becoming a mediator in this crisis. And they're well aware of wait, Amir to travel to Saudi for Qatar talks. It's like, now the question becomes, do you think Kuwait's can take back its role as a regional leader? Can this crisis help them to showcase that country for foreign investments? Well, let us know what you think in the comment section below. We're waiting to happen

Speaker 1:          11:02          from you.

Speaker 2:          11:05          Meanwhile, things are far from quiet in Saudi Arabia. They're royal houses having an internal war to determine who is going to be the successor of the prince. Take here if you would like to know more about that
