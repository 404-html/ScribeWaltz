Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          many of you probably think all the countries in the Arabian peninsula are insanely wealthy, right? I mean this is the region of the wells where Qatar do volume. The rest of the oral Monica is our after all nonetheless arise in this region of the planet is a country that is extremely poor. The place where the GDP per capita lower than that of Tanzania or Senegal, the name of this country is Yemen and they just come with and going through a civil war that is lost dude for two years and look this, this, it's no small war. In fact, the war in Yemen is the Arabian equivalents to the war in Vietnam and we find two of the biggest powers in the Muslim world supporting different sides of the conflicts. On the one hand we have the Yemeni government supported by Saudi Arabia and all their allies including the United States and the only other side of there are the revolutionaries backed by Iran and between these two sides there is the many branch of dash or the so called and saw Al Sharia movement. Now, if you've been subscribed to visual politic for a while, you already know that Saudi Arabia has the third best equipped army in the entire wells boss. They have the sport of American drones exams, the armies of neighboring countries. They have more than 180 state of the art combat jets and 300,000 soldiers armed with the best weapons on the other side. They have less than half that number of soldiers and the weapons. They're armed with our far for modern. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:36          no,

Speaker 2:          01:36          this seems like a pretty unequal fight, right? Well, in that case in mind, surprise you to learn that Saudi Arabia is losing this war. Saudi Arabia says prepared for ceasefire in Yemen if who feeds agree and so now you might wonder how exactly is this possible? How is it possible to explain why one of the most advanced armies in the wells can speak to a bunch of gorillas? Well, today we have a geo politic. Well, we're going to answer that question, but before we get into any of that, let's have a look at the history. The first thing we need to understand is that this is not the first time Yemen has had a civil war. In fact, this is the third one in just 25 years. Yemen is a country divided by both ideology as well as religion. Indeed, before the 1990s at Yemen were split into two different countries. We had south Yemen with a communist governments and then there was north Yemen. You had a pro Saudi government and going you want to see on the screen now, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was the president of the north, started ruling over the entire country from its capital, the city of Sonata.

Speaker 2:          02:55          As you can imagine, slack is one of those politicians who consider as democracy and human rights to be wow. Pretty optional. Four years into his new country's history and the former southern communist leaders started an uprising against the less governments. This war only lasted a few months and the new government is one with the assistance of the Saudis. A decade later in 2004 Yemen had further antigovernment turmoil. This time the opposition was a rebel group of Shia Muslims. I remember their name because they are important for the war that's going on today. If he, I called the Houthi rebels, but again, these are like governments beach down this uprising.

Speaker 1:          03:32          Second

Speaker 2:          03:35          in 2011 with the Arab spring in full swing, the citizens rebelled against seller again. But this time salon I left power with his prime minister Manso this new president and found himself in control of a terribly weak governments. Father Ryle Chi. Edo we're working on destroying the country. And during all of this, while the protesters, they kept protesting. Now do you remember those few rentals? And we talked about just a moment ago. Well, they came back, but this time they were more powerful and it's had a lot of support. And this explains why in 2014 they managed to take over the government. Okay, so now you might be wondering, what did Al had he do? Well, he left the capital Lens, moved to the city of Arden in the south of the country to start a provisional. Governments

Speaker 2:          04:26          not remember him that Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Muslim country bands. Well, who is the biggest enemy of Sunni Muslims? Oh yeah. That would be the Shia Muslims. These are exactly the people who have conquered the capital of Yemen, and this explains why the Saudis aren't so keen on supporting our hardy and his provisional governments in arden. Then finally, we also have Dash Aka Islamic state in the next as well, who all well in enemy of both sides. All right, so now we have the Houthi rebels and their supporters, the who things are Shia Muslims and therefore they are friends with Iran. On the other hands, Al Hadi is an artisan antia supported by the Saudis and the Saudis will do whatever it takes to ensure that Iranian influence in Yemen is minimized. You probably remember from one of our previous videos that Saudi Arabia and Iran on die on enemies. Anne's last in 2015 and another year, many civil war started.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Okay?

Speaker 2:          05:31          Natural fortress. When we think about Saudi Arabia, we think of a big desert with clean sand dunes, Yemen, it's rather different. It is a country full of mountains, almost as high as the rockies in the United States. Some peaks are higher than 3,600 meters.

Speaker 1:          05:52          What if

Speaker 2:          05:52          this makes it really hard to transport a big army no matter how well equipped us. For instance, the Saudis, they utilize a tank model called the m one abrams. This is sort of like the BMW of tax. Now imagine a convoy of these machines crossing a path where they have to travel in singles,

Speaker 3:          06:12          you would just need a few guerrilla warriors with an RPG seven rocket launcher to destroy an entire battalion. The RPG seven is a rocket launcher that you can see on video games such as call of duty and it has a market price of around 3000 US dollars. The m one Abrams tank on the other hand, cost around $6 million.

Speaker 1:          06:37          Wow.

Speaker 2:          06:37          Well, not any that, as we said at the start of this video, the Saudi coalition has over 180 combat jets and also American drones, but there is a further problem here in the landscape full of mountains and caves. It really is easy to hide from these drones. And also even the state of the art of radars can see in detail what's inside of the caves

Speaker 2:          07:04          as of course the toothy warriors. They know the battlefield like the back of their hands, and they know where all the good hiding places are. In many cases, they can travel from one village to another without being exposed to any of the drone radars. They can also hide their weapons inside these caves bus that is still not all evenly. These gorillas that have no hummers or rather modern vehicles, they have something better. They have animals. Oh yes, you heard that right? In those high mounds in areas, the least effective way to transport something is by using donkeys or cameron. So in other words, the new way of tracking the movements of these guerrilla warriors is by having people behind the lines. Now we're not exactly talking double o seven like spies heritage rather than local citizens who are willing to help or soldiers who are close to enemy lines. All right, so even with these problems, you might still be wondering how the Saudis and getting basin the scale seemed to still be tips pretty far in Saudi Arabia's favor.

Speaker 1:          08:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:11          eight demotivated army. Now, many of you might think that the political system of the country has nothing to do with the way they organize their army and conducted.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Whoa.

Speaker 2:          08:22          Well actually in a country like Saudi Arabia, they all really connectors in an absolute monica like they have in Saudi Arabia. The royal house cannot trust that army. Then laying the obsession is keeping control over the entire military from the top all the way to the bottom. This is why the decision making power is slower than in any other

Speaker 1:          08:41          [inaudible]. Let's

Speaker 2:          08:48          have a look at a hypothetical example here because it'll illustrate of assets. Let's imagine a soldier discovers a machine gun nest that is a three beats is out in western army such as the American or British one. That soldier can easily ask for reinforcement by radio. Usually he or she would go alongside with another soldier from the air force. You can give the exact coordinates to a pilot nearby and in a matter of minutes, a combat jet is bombing the machine gun nest. Now let's consider the Saudi Ami Festival. That soldier would have to tell the sergeants and that sergeant, we'd have to speak to someone higher up and at the time that decision has really reached somebody who can actually make the decision. It's been longer than an hour. The 60 minutes here are the difference between neutralizing and enemy position and using a soldier. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:33          Awesome.

Speaker 2:          09:34          The same goes for military training. Most Saudi officials come from the royal houses and they didn't go through any sort of academic and military training.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Okay?

Speaker 2:          09:45          They got that position due to pure nepotism, and this means, well, a distinct lack of knowledge and skills. The same goes for normal soldiers as well. As you probably know in most of these oil monarchies, most of the needs of citizens work as civil servants with sky high salaries. They really don't know anything about discipline or hard work.

Speaker 1:          10:04          Okay,

Speaker 2:          10:06          so let's look at an example. In the video here, you can see that they don't even know how to protect the tank with infantry and don't forget that inside that tank it's very difficult to see the outside. This is why a basic principle of war is that you always want to have soldiers walking around the tank so that they can see if something is firing upon it. This really is wall one o one. Nevertheless, the Saudis, Ms. Dot. Clawson. This explains why it is so easy to destroy their tanks with Sinatra. Shiva weaponry. How are we looking at this on the video? Yeah, you can see how someone gets close enough to a tank to put a bomb on it.

Speaker 1:          10:53          Oh,

Speaker 2:          10:54          hand behind. Surprisingly that he's he rebels have a much more western management system. Small groups can react quickly. Yams, they do need to go all the way up through the hierarchy. Plus then motivation is way higher because they don't have the option of just retiring. Arguably, they are defending their home from a foreign army. In summary, the war on Yemen is a really excellent example of how strategy is more important than weaponry and is that an authoritarian system makes for a less efficient.

Speaker 1:          11:25          Oh, nice.

Speaker 2:          11:29          Sadly, the fact that the Saudis on losing this wall doesn't mean they're not killing people. In fact, the opposite,

Speaker 1:          11:35          it's true hole in

Speaker 2:          11:38          Yemen conflict passes 10,000 unfortunately, what could have been solved in a peaceful, democratic way? It has become a war of attrition that will leave a footprint on this country for generations to come and now the question is, Dean, you think the Saudis can turn the table on this conflict or are we going to see this conflict last for a long time to come?
