Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15          Politic. We have talked about how we now live in a world where every day there is less poverty and people are able to live better. Lives are changed. That is even reaching the most unprotected region in the world. Sub Saharan Africa.

Speaker 3:          00:26          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:29          We talked about the African lions and paid special attention, so in cases like Rwanda, however, we still need to talk about when and why this region of the world, which so many considered hopelessly destitute began to change.

Speaker 3:          00:40          Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Well, that is precisely what we are going to talk about in this video. That's ams. What we can expect in the upcoming years. Four years talking about Africa has men's talking about extreme poverty, natural disasters and all kinds of conflicts and in a way things are still about, wait, see? No. More or less than half. Yes. Half of all the people who suffer from extreme poverty in the world live in these sub Saharan African region. We're talking about 400 million people have also like this isn't surprising either.

Speaker 4:          01:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the United Nations in 1945 now, more than 20 million people across four countries face starvation and famine. Stephen O'Brien, the UN under secretary general for humanitarian affairs.

Speaker 2:          01:40          Do you do all of this? I'm sure nobody has the stranger to those Ngo campaigns seeking to raise funds for all kinds of humanitarian catastrophes in Africa. You're probably also familiar with governments allocating billions of dollars each year to official development assistance. In fact, government aid is as high as it's ever been. Every year the African guns and receives about $50 billion and this, it's been going on for them

Speaker 1:          02:00          decades.

Speaker 2:          02:06          However, the truth is that for years, all of this money, it didn't help very much. Let's take a look at, for example, the 1919

Speaker 4:          02:12          yes

Speaker 2:          02:22          Wallington national aid in this area of the world amounts to tens of billions. What do you think happens with poverty? Do you think it decreased? Well, no. None of that happen.

Speaker 4:          02:31          Sure.

Speaker 2:          02:34          1990 and 1998 it's poverty levels went from 55% to 58

Speaker 4:          02:39          is that,

Speaker 2:          02:42          well, how could this be? You might ask. Well because intentions are one thing but reality is ready difference. Some experts claim that's it. For years, official aid weakens local print

Speaker 4:          02:52          juices. Evidence

Speaker 1:          02:56          overwhelmingly demonstrates that aid to Africa has made the poor

Speaker 2:          03:00          poorer and growth slower. Dambisa Moyo an economist and the author of dead aid. Why aid is not working and how there is a better way for Africa. For example, in Tanzania it was cheaper to buy subsidized the milk from the European Union oven from local producers. However, with the beginning of a new century, suddenly everything began to change

Speaker 3:          03:25          for great change. Suddenly

Speaker 2:          03:31          only when Africa seemed helpless, everything began to change. With the beginning of the 21st century, statistics absolutely turns around. Since the year 2000 and extreme poverty has dropped by almost 40% average life expectancy has grown by more than 10 years. Infant mortality has decreased to less than half the same as happens with HIV infections in children as well. Virtually any other

Speaker 3:          03:52          statistic. If we look good,

Speaker 2:          03:57          the economy will be able to see how between 2000 and 2015 sub Saharan African countries excluding South Africa, which has a bit of a peculiar case as we've seen on visual politic previously grew by an average of 6% which is more than twice, for example, Latin America. Another great indicator of how things are changing is tourism.

Speaker 3:          04:18          Okay?

Speaker 2:          04:20          Yup. Tourism. You heard that right? The tourism sector has some particular characteristics that reveal a lot of information. On the one hand, this sector has great transformational power for the poorest because it's very labor intensive and on the other hand can we need to take into account so that people don't vacation in countries that are at war or a famine or have epidemics. It's just not a nice holiday. When this industry improves in the poorest countries, it is usually a good indicator that things are improving as a whole. What if we see the data? We might be quite surprised because this sector has been growing as an average annual rate of no less than 9% for 20 years. That is two full decades of nearly double digit growth. Yes, it does seem as if things are really moving forward,

Speaker 3:          05:04          which

Speaker 2:          05:10          bought at this point in the video, you might be wondering something because I certainly am. What on earth happens to cause such a change? Well, have a look at this graph because it really gives a clue what, what exactly led to this miracle. Well, that's have a look at that.

Speaker 3:          05:33          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:34          Airing for takeoff

Speaker 3:          05:38          things

Speaker 2:          05:38          drive change, but we will now see how three particular events in Africa began to change probably permanently. This continence reality, the first one it was remittances. See in Africa the population grows very quickly, which along with the terrible living conditions has led. Many Africans do immigrates to rich countries in the past few decades. Today, these people send tens of billions of dollars home every year. This money is used in local markets or to set up businesses. These are what we call remittances ans they are actually much more important than developmental eight seconds and very importantly, in March of 2000 the u s Congress finally approved a law that had been promoted by Bill Clinton in his last years in office. It's called the African Growth and Opportunity Act. This is basically a law that establishes a preferential trade agreements that eliminates terrorists and reduces barriers to trade for thousands and thousands of products from sub Saharan Africa. See, since this agreement was approved, we can see that between 2000 and 2016 which went exactly the most prosperous years, have a trade between the United States in sub Saharan Africa multiplied two and a half times, which means a 6% growth every year and third and perhaps the key to everything. There's China. Yup. Yeah. Have the rights. In 2001 China, it joins the World Trade Organization as became something of a factory to the world. Well, what has happened since then has been quite impressive. China's huge grief has lifted tens of millions of people out of poverty, both in China and in Africa.

Speaker 5:          07:10          Government of China and that was when in the honest thing, Ethiopia's industrialization and on supporting the yes, great vision to become Africa's manufacturing.

Speaker 4:          07:24          Oh,

Speaker 2:          07:29          to explain myself yet the Asian giants, gigantic grief has increased this country's demands for all kinds of products, raw materials, food, manufacturing, everything. Well, many African countries took advantage of this opportunity since the year 2000 to trade between China and Africa has multiplied by no less than the 17 times representing an annual growth rate of almost 20% since 2009 China is already by far the continent's largest trading. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          07:55          Partner.

Speaker 2:          07:58          There's not only that, the Chinese, as we mentioned here have also been investing a lot of money all over the world and Africa is certainly no exception. Yeah. In 2016 four out of every 10 euros that Farhan is invested in, Africa came from China. Today more than 10,000 Chinese companies are doing business on the African continent is can I sleep? Private companies that work in all kinds of industries and that number one, it just keeps running.

Speaker 2:          08:27          Yes. My friends. This is how Africa has managed to start turning the statistics around the greatest catalyst for this entire change. It wasn't some kind of miracle and it didn't have much to do with developmental aid. This change was driven by trade and investments and Africans themselves seem to see it very clearly and if you don't believe me, I'll take a look at this. African countries are forging ahead to complete negotiations for continental free trade area between 55 countries by early next year. The idea adopted by the African Union in 2012 is to create a single market which includes the free movement of goods, services and people. Yes, that's right. Africa is working to expand the trade to every corner of the continents. Not all countries are developing equally, but this is quite normal and then all parts of the world following the Asian Star

Speaker 2:          09:22          points, we need to ask ourselves the question, can we really dream of Africa's final takeoff? See, I suspect that many of you are probably thinking right now. Well everything you say in visual politic is very nice, but it isn't usually what really happens. Well, yes, in Africa, it's absolutely true that all countries that are doing well and there are countries that are not doing well, but you know what? That's true, but it's also really normal. See, it may sound shocking today, but in the 1950s Asia was this poor as Africa. I mean today we can look at cities like Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei. It makes it really hard to imagine that these places will. One is pork. The when South Korea or Taiwan began to grow, they weren't richer than Ghana or Senegal for example, and China, India and Vietnam era. Of course, way poorer.

Speaker 3:          10:05          Okay,

Speaker 2:          10:11          can absolutely draw some really interesting ideas from this because Asian countries didn't grow all at once and they didn't grow all together. While Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan grew. Other countries such as China, Indonesia, and India remains in mass

Speaker 3:          10:24          poverty.

Speaker 2:          10:26          They weren't exactly democratic models. South Korea and Taiwan were under hard dictatorships until very recently. Singapore is in a similar state. China, well, what can I say in shorts and lots of poverty, some more advanced countries with others. Further behind is plenty of dictatorships. Essentially what we're seeing in Africa today wasn't so different from what was happening in Asia just 50 years ago.

Speaker 3:          10:55          Ready

Speaker 2:          10:55          for takeoff? Yes. Things in Africa are changing after the 10 countries that are apparently growing the most in 2017 five are in Africa.

Speaker 3:          11:10          If we

Speaker 2:          11:10          take a look at the latest to doing business reports, the wells bank indicator for measuring how easy it is to do business in certain economies, we can see the towns of the 10 countries that have improved the most for are also African. True poverty here is still very high and these countries are facing a difficult challenge. Indeed, the large population growth on the continent is actually going to multiply in the upcoming decades. However, the good news is that everything indicates, but thanks to trade and international investments. Africa is finding its way and it's maybe once and for all is ready for takeoff, but I would see what town do you think that Africa will emulate, the developments that Asia has had in recent decades?
