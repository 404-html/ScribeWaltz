Speaker 1:          00:09          Sebastian pinera is already presidents. Well, actually he's president again because as you all know, this political leader was president of Chile, barely two mandates ago, between 2010 and 2014

Speaker 2:          00:27          Tina

Speaker 1:          00:28          now after achieving a strong and healthy victory by almost 10 points in the 2017 presidential elections to and pin yarrow was declared president on March the 11th. They have you in this video today, we are going to be seeing what kinds of chili this president is inheriting as well as the greatest challenges that lie ahead for him, but first of all, let's get to know this character better. Let's see who Sebastian Pinera really is.

Speaker 3:          01:03          Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Is Sebastian Kenyatta? We need to know that Sebastian Pinera for many reasons, isn't just another politician we use. We're talking about a man who on the one hand zones, one of the biggest fortunes in Chile for Fortune Forbes magazine estimates. There's no less than two point $7,000,000,000. Yep. You heard that right?

Speaker 2:          01:29          You'll see them. They'll go, yet nobody's suitable. Keep the feet on the politicals. He lost the wound book. I know.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Yes. Sebastian Pinera was an aggressive, self-made businessmen, but do not be fooled by his smile. His record shows that for a long time knew how to play to the limit and it's become a major investor in various sectors such as construction, supermarkets, airlines, and TV channels. Now that I think about it, it's really hard to find a sexier in which pin Yaarit didn't try his luck. Even in 2006, he decided to death on the football industry and took control of a team, but not just any team. Nope. He took control of the most important soccer team in Chile. Color color. Of course. Many critics accuse him of buying this team north as an investment spot, as a political maneuver like Silvio Berlusconi, but don't think that Pinera is exploit, swell only in the business exit. Not at all. In fact,

Speaker 1:          02:42          the political arena, the current president of Chile also left his mark in 2010, he became the first right wing presidents to be democratically elected since 1958. He also became the first right wing president since Chile underwent its democratic transition after a Gusto Pinochet's Yep. Now in 2018, this is happening again. In other words, we could say that Sebastien Vignette road is a pretty fortunate guy and I don't think he'd disagree. Well, the fact is that in his first term, despite having to face the consequences of a terrible earthquake that shook his country just two weeks before he took office, his first governments had relatively good results, at least half of our efforts throughout the entire administration were devoted to rebuilding the country, and consequently we had to sacrifice many things. We wanted to do Rodrigo Hinzpeter, minister of the interior and Minister of defense in Sebastian Pianos for government. The truth is that no great revolutionary change really happens. However, in his first four years of government in the economy grew by more than five percent per year, more than 1 million jobs were created, wages increased, poverty fell sharply. We had a really good government in which every social and economic indicator improved in Chile, but I have more experience now and experience counts, Sebastian Miata. And the truth is the viewer. In this case, all that experience can be really, really important. And why is this? Well, because today chili is really quite different. I mean, pay attention to this.

Speaker 1:          04:23          Today's Chili.

Speaker 3:          04:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:28          He told you here on visual politic previously, and I don't think it will surprise anyone, but in the last few decades, Chile has been something like Latin America's Christiana, Ronaldo, the country that grew the most, the one that had the most success, convincing proof of this was the evolution of the Chilean middle class, which multiplies by almost three within a very short span of time. The Chilean Middleclass grew from 23 point seven percent to 64 point three percent of the population in 25 years. However, as we saw in a previous video in recent years, specifically during Micell Bash, allays last term, things really changed.

Speaker 4:          05:04          Wished you let them sooner.

Speaker 3:          05:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:21          As we mentioned in recent years, economic growth has plummeted. Job Creation has slowed, wages haven't grown, and foreign investment has dropped. Lately. The only thing that has grown in Chile has been the number of public employees, taxes and bureaucracy. That's right. Practically every economic parameters made a very negative change during the child. Ashley's last time. I mean, check this out, there has been an average growth of belly one point eight percent per year, which implies that this legislation was the worst economic growth since the democratic trends

Speaker 3:          05:53          session. In fact,

Speaker 1:          05:56          in recent years she has grown,

Speaker 5:          05:58          uh, less than the world economy and it's considerably less than it's specific alliance counterparts, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. And that's not all the public deficit when from being a guest to a permanent tenants. And of course that's certainly has consequences. Public debt, although still low, has reached its highest level since 1993.

Speaker 1:          06:23          Having the fiscal debt double every four years isn't sustainable. That's the road to the precipice for leap. Lorraine, Minister of finance, although by far the worst development has been the four year consecutive drop in investments and it wasn't only the economy that went. South crime rates have increased a lot in the near region where there's a conflict with the indigenous people. The mapuches who demands more autonomy and recognition. Violent acts have exploded growing by a hundred and 50 percent.

Speaker 1:          07:07          And even regarding the government's decision to suspend the hospital concession system has meant that the government has barely been able to invest more than half of what they'd budgeted, making wait lists and quality issues, a chronic problem, and let's not deceive ourselves here as always, the ones most effected by all of this are not the richest, but the middle class, and even more so for the most vulnerable people in the population, the poor people. In other words, it's fair to say the Chileans have new reason to celebrate me, how Basha lays last time. Indeed, they were an incredibly intense four years. Now perhaps we could analyze what's happening in Chile by taking a look at their economic freedom index, who's correlation with a country's level of wealth and prosperity is very high. Well, during the calabash relays, last term, eat felt from seventh position too.

Speaker 3:          07:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:01          Anyway, this is the situation that the new president of Chile has to face. And now the question we need to ask ourselves is, what should this new government's priorities be? What can we expect? What should we expect from them? Well, let's take a look.

Speaker 5:          08:13          That's the name of it. If you're not getting it a little bit,

Speaker 1:          08:39          great challenges. Well, it seems quite clear. There's in a country that isn't exactly cheap and in which three out of four workers make less than $800 a month, the economy has to be then number one priority. If the economy isn't doing well, social statistics do well either, and this seems to be very, very clear for the new government. In fact, Pinera, the new president has promised to focus his efforts on doubling economic growth. Creating hundreds of jobs sends laying the foundations for Chile to become the first developed country in Latin America by 2025,

Speaker 1:          09:15          but of course you might be thinking, well, how on earth can they achieve this? I hope he doesn't think that a mere tax reform is going to be enough to restore Chili's. Growth is going to need an aggressive policy to stimulate diversification. Almost half of the country's exports are still copper. Ricardo Hausmann. Well, to achieve the 20, 25 goal, the country needs to deal with three very clear priorities, diversifying their economy, improve their productivity, and adjust their public accounts. But do not think that this is an easy task to diversify the economy, to stop relying on raw materials, especially copper and boost their productivity. Then near is Chile will need a few things. First, they will need to promote investment, especially foreign investments that is attract more companies and foreign capital who will bet on Shelly to produce and provide services. Ms Dot lamb could really be helped by a reversal of bash delays, terrible tax reform, which not only raised taxes on companies, but also punished that investments. This was really not a good idea. Further, they should decrease the huge bureaucracy that exists. For example, by digitizing every possible process. Seconds, and this is a much more controversial issue for this Latin American country. They need to promote a program to attract foreign talents. Yeah, they really need to be promoting immigration.

Speaker 1:          10:31          You see, in Chile, the immigrant population has grown a lot in recent years, but it's still very low. It hasn't even reached three percent of the population and she lands like to compare themselves with Australia and New Zealand were immigrants make up 30 percent of the total population. 10 Times more than they do in Chile. Yes, you really did hear that right, and the best way to gain talents and promote different businesses and activities is to attract people with different skills and abilities from all over the world. We're actually going to be discussing that in more detail really soon, but for now, here's a great example. In Silicon Valley, the great global innovation center, Fifty four percent of entrepreneurs are foreign. Yeah, we're not talking about an open door, but we are talking about setting up a mechanism that clarifies and promotes talent attraction because, well, the end of the day, if it all goes well, surely you can aspire to become the great benchmark for business in Latin America. And that implies attracting professionals. In addition, and this is an important detail, according to all Chilean standards, immigrants have more education on average that Labor participation is much higher and they even though

Speaker 3:          11:39          money

Speaker 1:          11:40          policies eat, needs to enforce improving relations between universities and companies fighting insecurity and ending the public deficits as well as improving infrastructure and increasing savings.

Speaker 1:          11:54          So now if we take a look at the program, we will see that the president's promises seem to align with this, so in principle has been as good change is going to be really good for Chile. Now, of course, as always, only time will tell, but just hold on a moment because not everything is quite so simple. See, due to an electoral reform that a promoted pin Jerez coalition doesn't have a majority in Congress, so negotiating and seeking parliamentary agreements will be a priority for this new governmental team. So Dev you are. That's the way things are in Chile today, but now it's your turn. What's your opinion on Sebastian Pinera is new governments. Do you think his government will be good for Chile?
