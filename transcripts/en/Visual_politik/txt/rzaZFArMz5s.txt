Speaker 1:          00:08          In September of 2017, Puerto Rico suffered it's most significant natural disaster in the last 100 years. The impacts of Hurricane Maria, a huge category for cycling a category five at its strongest with wind gusts of over 155 miles per hour and torrential rain wreaks havoc on this islands. The destruction, it was enormous. Thousands of houses were destroyed in the entire Puerto Rican electricity network collapsed. The islands was quite literally engulfed in darkness. As you can imagine, the economic damage was enormous. To give you an idea today, the reconstruction costs have risen to around $100,000,000,000 and that's not at all. Seven months later, thousands of businesses remain closed and blackouts, I'll still quite frequent. However, if you are just wasting because Hurricane Maria, myself, the whole story,

Speaker 1:          01:09          he says that the island's problems began a really long time ago. Pressing Rico, they've been suffering a severe economic crisis and the population exodus for more than 10 years and exit is so great that it threatens the island's very survival. See officer declaring bankruptcy in May of 2017. The situation has become so critical that the islands government is considering moving thousands of prisoners do private prisons in the United States, so why is this? Well, the islands government is even having problems with financing it's own penitentiary system and renting spots in places like Texas or Florida is actually proving to be.

Speaker 2:          01:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Now, hold on just a moment here. I mean prisoners to the United States. It sounds kind of weird, but you absolutely heard it right. Do not forget the Puerto Rico is a part of the United States. It's not a state, but it's kind of a free associated state.

Speaker 2:          02:04          When we left, when we also love Puerto Rico, it has to back and

Speaker 1:          02:20          of course by being a part of the United States, having a tropical climate, a rich history, and it's beautiful white sand beaches on which by the way, Captain Jack Sparrow had some of his most famous exploits. We might think that Puerto Rico has everything required to be one of the most prosperous places in the world. Well, the reality is not so much. The truth is rarely rather difference. Here's a question for you. Where do you think most Puerto Rican slip? I mean it sounds like a bit of a silly question, but it isn't because the answer, it's not Puerto Rico. The escape. Yes, but first Puerto Rico may look like a paradise. Good weather, beautiful beaches, wonderful music. However, the island has a huge problem. Every year. Thousands and thousands of Puerto Rican leave the islands. See Puerto Rican been US citizens since 1917. They are Americans and they can move freely around that country. Well, according to data from the Pew Research Center, during the last decades, more than 500,000 Puerto Ricans have left Puerto Rico to move to the consonants, to places like Texas, Florida and New York and Pennsylvania.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Half a million people isn't absolutely huge number for an island that has just over 3 million inhabitants seen in another way. Not only in the last 10 years, one of every seven inhabitants has left Puerto Rico. Rather. The question I just asked, why do you think most pressure eakins lived? While the answer is that since 2006, there are more Puerto Ricans living in the continental United States than there are on the island specifically more than 5 million compared to just over three. We were watching a real live demographic and population collapse on a monumental scale. Limestone and independent migration researcher and economist at the US Agriculture Department and things, well, they could get much, much worse, but the islands are in government expect just in 2018 for another 200,000 people to leave the islands. This means that Puerto Rico will lose about six percent of its population in a single year.

Speaker 2:          04:38          Sorry

Speaker 1:          04:40          if you thought this process, this accident was already severe. Well, the consequences of Hurricane Maria, they found the accelerated as different estimates, both from the governments and from private consultants expect another half million Puerto Rican to pack their bags and move to the consonants in the next five years. I'm very attached to my island and my preference is to stay here, but I have to think about what's best for my son, Victor Domingo's, a 39 year old mortgage banker to the Washington Post. As you may imagine, Centra flights. We'll have very serious consequences for the island, especially because most of those who are leaving a young infants, it is estimated that half of all immigrants, of all people who leave the islands are under 24 years of age, so what's the result of all of this? Well, in the next decade, Puerto Rico is population will decrease to two point 5 million people. That is to say in the next decade, Puerto Rico will lose 800,000 inhabitants, 25 percent of its population, and if another natural disaster, another hurricane, for example, the cars or if the island fails to recover from the severe crisis that's going through the reality, it could be even worse. I mean, can you imagine what this will mean for the island's economy? Who's going to pay? It's huge debt. Who's going to pay for its pension?

Speaker 1:          06:01          Well, I think at this point in the video we need to ask a question, why does so many Puerto Ricans leave the islands? These statistics seem to be similar to that of a country going through a war. So what's going on? Well, listen to this very long crisis. If we take a look at the data, the explanation seems very clear. Almost half of Puerto Rican is living on the islands are considered poor by US standards. The average family income is $20,000, which is slightly less than half of the average income of Mississippi. The poorest state in the continental United States.

Speaker 2:          06:40          Yes.

Speaker 1:          06:48          Well that's not all the islands. Government is bankrupt and it is a huge public desk. Seventy dollars, billion dollars and another $50,000,000,000 in payment commitments. Like for example, it's pensions or we're talking about an islands of just over 3 million inhabitants. So that's really an insane amounts of money. It means that an average family would have to devote six years of their salary to pay off the public debt. So now you might be able to understand why Puerto Rico is known as the grease of the Caribbean, and if you think this is the worst of it, when you're absolutely right, is that there's hardly any work in Puerto Rico. In fact, the island has the lowest activity rates in the United States. Only four out of every 10 adults actively looking for work. And if we don't come with the people who don't have a job in the public sector, who salaries come out. So if the taxes, the people who work in the private sector provide the results, it's pretty alarming. Less than a quarter of the island's inhabitants work in the private sector.

Speaker 2:          07:47          Bye.

Speaker 1:          07:48          Wait, one of Puerto Rico's great problems is precisely this. Public employees and officials see almost one out of every four jobs on the island corresponds to the governments. And that's not the worst part. Did you know that many of these public employees have the right to retire at the age of 50, which is 15 years earlier than in the rest of the United States. And if you want things to get even more terrifying, you can also keep in mind is that given the high percentage of young people leaving, the island's population is aging very, very quickly. In other words, if things don't change, Puerto Rico will enter a very, very difficult situation. But okay. I'm sure at this point in the video you're wondering, well, how on earth can the island get out of this mess? Is that really a way out for Puerto Rico? Well, that's how it look

Speaker 3:          08:41          how to get out of this. It's often

Speaker 1:          08:45          said that those who don't learn from history are condemned to repeat it, and indeed this might happen in Puerto Rico when we talk about how local politicians see the future, we find some good things, but also some not so good things. Puerto Rico has gone bankrupt. That's the facts. And if they continue like this, the government could push the islands into the abyss. So for one public spending has to be cost. They have to stop the drainage. That has caused such a huge amount of public

Speaker 4:          09:09          debt.

Speaker 1:          09:11          Principal, the new government, Ricardo Rosales is working on this. In fact, he's committed to decreasing the government's size by a lot. The volume is how he wants to do it, isn't exactly clear indeed is not really clear if there's a real political will to correct the islands. Massive problem. The Puerto Rico has to turn its economic policy around and set some serious plans in motion in order to attract investments. This is because Puerto Rico needs decisive measures. It needs real reforms and not just cosmetically changes. A few things have been done in recent years. For example, they are trying to defend Puerto Rico into what kinds of financial center, the guarantees anonymity to international investors work, but there's still a really long way to go. Now, before we end today's video, we still have to ask a very important question. How on Earth did Puerto Rico get to this point? Well, one reason was that local government spent huge amounts of money to hire us. We saw many public workers and to fund expensive projects that didn't give the island anything other than more

Speaker 2:          10:16          debt.

Speaker 1:          10:18          Reason has a lot to do with influence from the United States, but that's something we're going to tell you about in an upcoming video. For now, it's your turn because I want to ask a question of you. Do you think the pressure Rico should continue to belong to the United States? So do you think they should seek to become an independent country? Well, you can leave your answer in the comments below as well as in this day, and I really hope you enjoyed that video.
