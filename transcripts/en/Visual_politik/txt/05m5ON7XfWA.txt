Speaker 1:          00:08          Don't want us to become something like the Asian version of Asterix and Obelix is irreducible village, a small enclave surrounded by a great empire that wants to engulf. It ends as with the small Gaelic village. The citizens of Taiwan also have their own magic potion to defend themselves against their enemies. Of course, in this case, we aren't talking about potions made by a druid. We're talking about the power of the United States of America. Well, the United States, and also reasonably well something else folks. Taiwan has a new ally, a new secret advantage that is already fueling Beijing's wrath, so listen up. Beijing's rat one is facing enormous pressure from mainland China, which as you know, planes the island as part of its territory, and we're not talking about the usual international politics tug of war where you know the usual. You get to that. Can you take it? I get angry, I threaten you. Then we ultimately let it be known. That is not the situation here at all. Beijing, they've actually even set a deadline. The Chinese government has made it clear time and time again that it's ready to do what it takes, and the fourth year, 20, 49 for the centennial of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan will have to rejoin mainland China.

Speaker 2:          01:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Course. This leads to a problem maddens and not exactly a small one that I went is they're not really in favor of it. In fact, they want nothing to do with it. In fact, as we mentioned here on visual politic in 2016, the Democratic Progressive Party of sight in Wang who by the way, it was one of our 2017 are award winning leaders of the year and there's something of an independent games at power in Taiwan. All the power, both of Congress and the presidency. And since then, let's just say Beijing hasn't taken it very well. Uh, in fact, that wouldn't be accurate. They took it horrible. Tying Wang became president practically from the very first minute Beijing's pressures against the island have multiplied. And in recent months it's already reached politically obsessive levels. They've cut diplomatic ties, try to punish Taiwan economically and have implemented huge military exercises all around the island.

Speaker 1:          02:30          That's not all Tszujing things. Government is also using all leds means to, uh, raise Taiwan's name and identity from the map. For example, when we published our first video about Taiwan, 20 countries formally recognize the islands government in Taipei is China's legitimate government. Yes, as we've covered before, Taiwan has never declared its independence, but for years it's claimed it's China's legitimate government. And of course diplomatically our country can only have one recognize government. Well, Beijing has multiplied its diplomatic agenda to end the situation today, just a year later. Only 17 countries consider it so, and almost all of them are tiny, but that's not all. In fact, given the circumstances, Beijing's move would be understandable. Something like you're, I'm the legitimate government of China, but this is no longer a question of who's the legitimate governments, but simply the Beijing has said both actively and passively that it will never allow Taiwan to become independent.

Speaker 1:          03:30          And one way to prevent that is precisely by trying to erase all traces of the islands. National identity tried essentially he wants people to think Taiwan wants that car. Brands you see in order to pull this off, Beijing is blocking the presence of Taiwanese representatives and even it's journalists from all of the international bodies that it can, such as the World Health Organization, it's finding companies that sell products in China with the mainland Taiwan label. This is something that has happened to the Japanese Jane Muji. Another case we know about is that of the gap clothing Shane, which had to apologize for selling tee shirts in North America that didn't include Taiwan as part of China. Even say when he's music groups like the Indie punk band, fire axe. So you don't support the reunification are disappearing from Chinese streaming music services. And how about one more example? Well, due to Beijing's threats, airlines from all over the world and no longer using the islands name. Yep. You're really did hear that, right? Even American companies aren't using Taiwan's name anymore. I mean, yes, you can absolutely book a ticket from New York to Taipei, but don't ask which country you're going to. Although yes, unlike other international companies such as British Airways or Lufthansa or who are already selling tickets to Taiwan, this part of China, American companies have simply resorted to the ghost country trek. The ghost country trick is them just selling tickets to Taipei and when anyone asks, it's just a response of who cares.

Speaker 1:          04:55          We can't blame them. The trainees aviation market is simply too big and many companies have direct interests in that country. Trainers goal regarding Taiwan has never changed. That goal is just swallow up. Taiwan, sovereignty, exterminate Taiwanese democracy, and achieved ultimate unification Lee tongue where Taiwan's first democratically elected president to the New York Times without getting any further. American Airlines is a shareholder of China, Southern Airlines and Delta on the other hands of China, Eastern Airlines. However, just a moment here because it's not all bad news for Taiwan along with the US is support. The island has gains and other powerful ally, or you could say hi. One is developing its own magic potion that no, I'm not talking about weapons. Listen Up Mecca

Speaker 2:          05:51          folks.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Taiwan has been chosen as the first Asian host of the Oslo Freedom Forum, like a Congress and international meeting on human rights, but some of you might be wondering a congress, I mean is that rarely so important while devalue it. In fact, it is not so much for the congress, but ultimately what it means.

Speaker 2:          06:12          Even though

Speaker 3:          06:13          global democracy has experienced a general trend of backsliding in the past few years, Taiwan's democracy has persisted and continues to thrive. Taiwan can continue to serve as an inspiration to Democrats in Asia, including those in China. Ketty Jen, vice president of the Taiwan Foundation for democracy.

Speaker 1:          06:31          You see, for decades, Hong Kong was the great bastion of freedom of expression in this area of the world. So if international media and human rights organizations establish their headquarters there, and not only that, Hong Kong mostly became a refuge for many political exiles. Like for example, the student leaders who lead the Tiananmen Square protest. However, in recent times as we've seen here on visual politic, things have changed and Beijing has tightened its grip on Hong Kong's politics.

Speaker 3:          07:12          Kong was originally the first choice for the Asia Bureau, but today China doesn't just suppress its own people. It is now increasingly exporting that suppression to Hong Kong. Will Eric, I see an emeritus member of Reporters Without Borders and a student leader of the 1989 tiananmen protests

Speaker 1:          07:30          boss. As this change was taking place, Taiwan consolidated itself as a vibrant democracy and one of the freest places in the region, but that's precisely why it's replacing. Hong Kong is the Mecca for freedom activists and human rights in Asia. This is even though Taiwan until 1987, was under the control of an ironclad dictatorship. Now, for example, one of the human rights film festivals that used to be held in Hong Kong has been moved to Taiwan. Lamb, winky, one of the Hong Kong book publishers who was kidnapped by the Chinese government two years ago has announced that he will reopen his bookstore in Taiwan and Reporters Without Borders announced in 2017 that it's first Asian office will be in Tai Pei.

Speaker 3:          08:19          Freedom of expression is a big part of Taiwanese culture. Cedric the Taipei bureau director of Reporters Without Borders.

Speaker 1:          08:27          These are just some examples of what it was already becoming. A generalized trends, democracy, political plurality, freedom of expression, human rights, same sex marriage. Taiwan is becoming a benchmark for all of them and obviously this poses a huge problem for China's interests.

Speaker 2:          08:42          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:42          for one, the Taiwanese love freedom, so of course they don't want anything to do with being ruled again by Beijing and for another while the Chinese government attempts to erase, to annihilate at the time when he's identity throughout the wells, the country has suddenly emerged as a center of freedom with all the influence that that entails. Also, it's much harder to consider attacking a country that is famous for its commitment to human rights. International community simply would not accept it, and the truth is that this maybe Taiwan's best move this one up, the new move, July 2018, the second Apache helicopter squadron made in Taiwan went into service. It's part of what is strengthening the partnership between Washington and Taipei, of which incidentally we're going to speak about in a future video. Among other things, this includes a significant increase in the sale of equipment and military technology to the island. One is buying helicopters, tanks, missiles, anti aircraft systems, and now even wants to develop its own submarines. However, despite all of this, it seems increasingly clear that militarily, it'll be difficult for Taiwan to stop China. The budget difference is simply overwhelming. China's military budget is between 15 and 20 times that of Taiwan and it shows,

Speaker 2:          10:08          yes,

Speaker 1:          10:08          yes, it's true nowadays there's the United States umbrella, but even that isn't enough to have the guarantee that the international community would act in their favor. Taiwan needs to reinforce its influence in the world, especially if it wants to become an independent country. Now the question we need to ask ourselves here is how on earth I think going to be able to achieve this?

Speaker 1:          10:32          Well, folks that may surprise you, the military strategy, while essential may not actually be the most important thing here, Taiwan has to gain influence and prominence in the world while overcoming the economic problems that we talked about in a previous video. To do so, it can, for example, seek to attract students from all over Asia and indeed the world by giving them facilities, promoting programs in English and attracting first grade teachers. That would mean gaining a lot of influence and of course human capital. Seconds, Taiwan can set in motion and aggressive policy to attract multinationals and to get them to establish not only factories here, but above all research centers and administrative headquarters. They can do so by devoting special attention to attracting content creation companies, media, film studios, Youtube as et Cetera, et Cetera,

Speaker 2:          11:24          that

Speaker 1:          11:24          the government could seek to become a logistics enclave, for example, by developing its app or capabilities and thus becoming a large communication sub for thick and attract more professionals from the rest of Asia. This would allow her to both face the islands aging population problem and also to strengthen its ties with the workers, places of origin and fifth, it must continue to promote its role as a center for human rights and freedom of expression. All right, so maybe this plan is not as exciting as just buying huge weapons, but it would certainly be cheaper as trying to compete with China only via the military route seems complicated and it would boost the island's economy as well as give it a lot of influence around the world given the circumstances. A university, a film studio, a hotel, or the headquarters of a human rights or multinational organization can be much more important for the island survival than for example, a battleship. This is not about giving some ultra pacifist discourse or anything like that. It's just about pure pragmatism.

Speaker 2:          12:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:25          If we're talking about guaranteeing Taiwan's independence and freedom, this is how to do it, but now it's your turn.
