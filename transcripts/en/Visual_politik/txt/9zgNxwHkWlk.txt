Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:08          on the 1st of July, visio Canada celebrated it's 150th birthday. Now we told you all about this in a previous video where we also showed you some of the keys as Dwight Canada is one of the most admired countries in the entire wells, kinda instability to into 10 provinces and three territories just have so many unique regulations that in 2017 they actually had to sign a free trade agreement among them. However, even though this country is turns 150 in perfect shape, Canada is also facing problems. Faye, social, political and economic threats that could be considered. Well, pretty serious indeed because as you probably already know, well, unfortunately nothing is perfect. So in a previous video who's link I'll leave at the end of this video as well as in the description below. We looked on the bright side of things and Canada ended up looking pretty darn wonderful. But in this video we're going to discuss the main problems and threats that are affecting Canada and well the first of them, it's got a lot to do with this 150th anniversary birthday. Somehow artificial Canadians not even close, celebrated this 150th birthday. We can find several different reasons why, but in order to explain them, we should first tell you about what happens 150 years ago, so that's jumped back in time all the way to 1867 on the 1st of July of that year. The territory was still a part of the British empire, but it was on this day for the first British North America Act was signed.

Speaker 2:          01:45          The British North America Act of 1867 was a law that united the three colonial provinces of New Brunswick, new Scotland and Canada, which is divided up into Ontario and Quebec. That very same day into the Confederation of Canada of these four provinces, which still counts quite a loss of autonomy. A federal government was organized to to give them some cohesion above this government's, there was still the British authorities. Thanks to this day, Canada is still a monarchy and Queen Elizabeth. The second is still the head of state. Also Bams, although it might sound surprising, Canada didn't have to till independence from the UK until very recently. 1982 in fact, that's right. Something's on 1982 any constitutional modification required to the approval of the British parliament. So as you can probably see from this, that law in 1867 it didn't result in a completely independent country bus Dev you is. That's not the ends of it. There are more reasons why Canadians dislike this day. The most important of these is that when the settlers arrived, Canada, well, it wasn't an empty lands

Speaker 3:          03:01          first nations, the inuits and the, yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:06          it's 1.5 million inhabitants said nothing to celebrate last July and those inhabitants my own v within natives of Canada, it's a celebration of the worst 150 years up indigenous peoples lives. Don't think of this as only a historical problem. The recognition and integration of these people's, it continues to this day to be a national problem. In fact, the government of Justin Trudeau, it hasn't made it a priority. Consider all the prime minister had to say on the 21st of June of this year. No relationship is more important to Canada. Then the relationship with the indigenous peoples, Justin Trudeau. Oh, you might be wondering, Hey, all these groups sounds, what has happened to them over the last 150 years?

Speaker 1:          03:49          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:53          According to the Canadian constitution, there were three large groups. The first nations made of more than 600 native communities. The inuits, the people of the Arctic and the methods, the result of mixing natives with the new settlers.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Canada was not an empty land. When the settlers arrived, it's actually estimated that there were around 500,000 people from these needs of communities who signed the agreements with the British and the French authorities. They even participated in the battles that protected the independence of Canada. Canada would be American today, if not for the Indian allies who fought for the crown. Peter Russell. Oh yes. The U s really did try to invade Canada more than once. While. The problem is that despite his being the first people in this land and despite the fact that they participated and contributed to the independence of the country, the natives suffered a clear cultural pass, a key.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Oh Shit.

Speaker 2:          04:48          Yup. As a result of that obsession, somehow to create a homogenous and national identities kind of just went through a period of persecuting the natives. For years, these people suffered the occupation of their territories and were sent away to reservations, which sometimes didn't even have the basic conditions that would allow for their survival. Furthermore, both their language and their cultural and religious rituals where sometimes forbidden this persecution, it reached such a point that the authority set up a system of residences and boarding schools for the children of native families. The government took the children from the families and sending them to schools where they would receive an education which was fully western so that they could lose all aspects of that cultural identity. Tens of thousands of children, they were educated in

Speaker 1:          05:31          this way

Speaker 2:          05:37          and these schools, they continued until the 1970s and the consequences, they still have to be dealt with today. Poverty rates are much higher than average. There are many broken families. Depression is rampant. Alcoholism and suicide rates are higher than average.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:58          All the consequences, all of this sorts of persecution along with these at racism and exclusion, we're also very normal.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Sorry.

Speaker 2:          06:08          In 2008 the prime minister at the time, Stephen Harper, apologized to these people's for the atrocities and established the truth and Reconciliation Commission. Sure. Speaker, I stand before you today to offer an apology to former students of Indian residential schools. The treatment of children in Indian residential schools is a sad chapter in our history. They've also paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reparations. That money can't fix all these problems. Even today, Canada is still looking for the best way to move forward from this dark period of its history, but now let's step back forward to the present day and look at the relationship between Canada and the u s oh well more. Absolutely. Canada and president

Speaker 1:          06:49          from [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          06:54          The breakup threat

Speaker 2:          06:58          is very dependent on its relationship with the United States. They are so dependent that we could almost say that the Canadians would be unable to live without best southern neighbor. Indeed, almost 70% of Canadian trade is bound for the United States, but at the industrial sector of both countries, it's strongly interconnected. So this is a special relationship and this is something Justin Trudeau knows indeed. He said so in his campaign, and as soon as he reached power, the concentrated is international affairs and to improving Canada's relationship with the United States. And so truth be told is the relationship that he built with Obama. Thank you again for your leadership and your friendship. I know that our two countries can achieve great things by working together as allies and as friends as we have done so many times

Speaker 1:          07:53          before.

Speaker 2:          07:59          There's some things we will probably never agree on who's beer is better, who's better at hockey?

Speaker 2:          08:12          Trump's in office and is pursuing a policy of protectionism Canada. What they've done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace. It's a disgrace. And so what did the Canadian government do? Well, they set up something of a war room. This was an office dedicated to following all the movements of the new administration in Washington. At first, the strategy of Trudeau and his people was buttering up the American government's and is it kind of looked like it was working. The Canadian Prime Minister even started a friendship with Ivanka trump. Trump's daughter Justin Trudeau, brings Ivanka trump to Broadway show on welcoming outsiders. As you can imagine, this opened the door to all sorts of wild rumors and speculation. The thing is they got on well and both have led a seminar on women in business. Donald Trump himself mentioned in a speech to Congress with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. We have formed a council with our neighbors and Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. Donald Trump. All right. I say this was all great. It seemed to be working really well. Bob's then all of a sudden trump attacks and accused Canada rather. I've done expectedly of unfair competition. Something that he also did with Mexico, right?

Speaker 2:          09:28          It would be really dangerous, but Canada to suffer a restriction on trade relations with the u s government in Ottawa decided to start these so called a doughnut strategy consisting of influencing all institutions around the White House, which would be considered as being in the center of that hole of the day. The question it now becomes, will they achieve that goal? No. Lead time will say, the first challenge is to renegotiate Nafta as trump has demand it. Now, next step, we need to consider another essential crisis that could threaten Canadian prosperity.

Speaker 1:          10:01          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:02          Real estate bubble.

Speaker 1:          10:03          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          10:05          Prices and Canada's housing market, they have absolutely skyrocketed. They've increased 76% and so have the loans that banks are providing. Indeed it. Family debt in Canada is now among the highest in the world. Have a look at this chart. Do you see the increase in Canadian real estate prices?

Speaker 1:          10:24          And then we'll

Speaker 2:          10:25          what's considered family.

Speaker 1:          10:30          But as you

Speaker 2:          10:32          measuring this is set off all sorts of economic alarms. Many analysts foresee at the popping of the Canadian real estate bubble along with all the consequences that that would have on its economy. And look, almost 7% of the country's employments belongs to the construction sector and thanks to this mortgage boom at three Canadian banks are now in the top 20 banks worldwide. In fact, the market value of the Royal Bank of Canada is higher than that of any bank in the eurozone.

Speaker 1:          10:59          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:59          As everyone knows, the consequences of the real estate bubble bursting would be pretty dire to doing something about. This has to come another priority of the Canadian government, the government's, it's trying to stimulate other sectors as well. Cooling down the real estate market, maybe the intention, so you increase the arrival of immigrants by 50% every year. It has a lot to do with this. More immigrants means more demand for real estate, but other experts, they disagree with this and state. The Canadian banks were not affected by the 2008 crisis and that they are quite a bit more solid than other international banks and also the economy in Canada. It's doing quite well and is gaining strength after some pretty mediocre. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:36          Yes.

Speaker 2:          11:41          Anyway, time will tell, but this is a risk that the government is going to have to look out for. All right, so now let's move on to the matter of public services.

Speaker 1:          11:51          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:53          The waiting lists. Health is a public service which is managed and financed by the governments with the citizens and its taxes. Of course, this system is considered to be one of the best in the world. However, they have recently had to deal with some very serious problems and most important of all of these problems is the issue of waiting lists. According to the Fraser Institute, the average time to see a specialist is 18 weeks. That's more than four months, and the demographic of the aging population and the increase of life expectancy has made it difficult for the system

Speaker 1:          12:25          cut

Speaker 2:          12:27          resulted in tens of thousands of Canadians and moving to the u s to receive medical attention lately that has even popular to take our medical insurance in the United States.

Speaker 2:          12:39          Anyway, these are the main challenges and threats to the government of Justin Trudeau. Like we said earlier, not everything, and be sunshine and lollipops and rainbows, but you know what we think are the overall results of the Canadian cocktail. Well, we think it looks pretty good.
