Speaker 1:          00:00          Located in the middle of the Himalayas in Nepal is one of the most isolated, remote and poorest countries in the world. Traditionally, it has been a kinds of protectorates or satellites country for India. However, at the end of 2017, the Communist Party of Nepal won the elections with an overwhelming majority and they've now set their sights on Beijing. In this video, we're going to show you what is happening as a bit about this country's greatest hidden treasure. So let's get into it. Alright, so I've got a question for you and please don't Google the answer. That would be cheating. Do you know which country Buddha was born in? One, two, three. Probably. Guess it's Nepal, the country located in the Himalayas, which hosts many of the highest mountains in the world, specifically in this country, which covers an area about the size of Nicaragua. We can find eight out of the 14 summits in the entire world, the reach more than 8,000 meters, and this includes, of course, Mount Everest becomes very also boasts a total of 240 pigs that reach higher than 6,000 meters. In other words, Nepal is a absolute paradise for people who love mountains, and by the way Katmandu, it's capital ends, the largest city in the Himalayas is also one of backpack. His favorite cities on the planet and well, why is that?

Speaker 2:          01:28          Yes,

Speaker 1:          01:32          well, maybe it does something to do with the fact that this city is full of temples, pagodas and Ali's full of life, like hobbies or were in the 21st century. You won't be able to find skyscrapers wide avenues, modern buses or practically any luxury franchise.

Speaker 2:          01:45          Yes,

Speaker 1:          01:48          it's pretty cool, right? Like one of those last drops of history in a totally modern and global world. Well, as wonderful as it sounds for a visit, the reality is that Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. According to the United Nations. Nepal is one of the Asian countries with the worst human development index. Scores in Nepal comes in at 144th in that ranking bands. I'll be honest, this isn't really surprising. See, despite having almost 30 million inhabitants, it's economy is smaller than that of Bolivia whose population belly exceeds 10 million people. That means that in per capita terms, Bolivia is three times richer than Nepal. That's why with everyday that passes 1,500 people move abroad, 1,500 people. And if you are, this has not made it easy for the Nepalese. Do you want to know why? Well, listen up dominated country.

Speaker 2:          02:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:59          The political system has been anchored in the past until practically the day before yesterday in 2008. Nepal was an absolute monarchy under the exclusive control of the king and by the way, fun little tidbit of knowledge right now despite being the birth place of butter itself, until 2006, this was the only country in the world were hidden. Do Islam was the official religion, but also leave that between 1996 and 2006. The country suffered through a civil war between governments or forces, the monarchy, dictatorship forces and the Maoist rebels who supported the establishment of a communist republic. Yes. You heard that right? Monarchy, civil war Maoism probably can understand now why this country is quite so poor. There has been such a huge amounts of chaos in the last 30 years, but the average life expectancy of a government was wait for it one year. You have you. That is certainly not everything. Nepal has another characteristic that is greatly conditioned. It's political and economic situation. See as you probably known, Nepal has no coast and have you noticed too all that only neighbors exactly in Nepal is stuck between two giants between the two most probable future great powers of this century. Of course, that's India and that's China to countries that Maura, that don't exactly get on very well as we have seen previously on visual politic.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Yes, we could say that both China and India are in the forefront of Nepal's. Ministry of Foreign Affairs mind. Well, the fact is that traditionally, and largely thanks to the geography that favors at Nepal has been kind of a satellite country for India, something the New Delhi government has always been very, very clear about

Speaker 3:          04:51          wants to micromanage Nepal. They have to control all government appointments. They have to know everything. They're ambassadors behave like viceroys, aren't we? A sovereign nation, Kishore Shrestha, editor of Jonah Asta National Weekly and a board member of Nepal's press council.

Speaker 1:          05:05          Perhaps the best proof of how India has always wanted to control this remote countries. Destiny happens in 2015, but that's the only political forces were designing the constitution of the newly created Democratic Federal Republic of the poll. Well, New Delhi demanded that Nepal create a separate province for people of Indian descent who were living in the terrain planes say region in southern Nepal on the border with.

Speaker 2:          05:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:41          This was something that the Nepalese political forces emphatically opposed. They wouldn't established political separations based on identity under any circumstances. Well, when New Delhi didn't get an affirmative answer, what do you think they did? Well, they blocked the borders. Now it was all but provision trucks, they just stopped crossing. Now, this would have been bad, really, really bad under any circumstances, but on top of all of that, this blockade happens when the country was at its worst, it adjusts, suffered a huge wake quake that caused enormous damage. The deadly's seven point eight magnitude earthquake struck Nepal in 2015 and killed thousands of people so powerful. It moved Mount Everest is he not want. This hasn't been the only blockade or the only strategy that India is used to pressure the Nepalese politicians to follow their advice offer. All trade with India has traditionally accounted for almost three quarters of all Napoli's trade, the now after centuries of absolute monarchy and decades of war and chaos. Things are finally beginning to normalize in the polk and democracy is gaining strength and also China's doors that are getting to open China's arrival.

Speaker 2:          07:02          Okay?

Speaker 1:          07:04          China and Nepal share a 1,400 kilometer border and in recent years, this border, it's become quite fashionable. Commercial relations between both countries have tripled since 2010 China results. It becomes the country. This invests the most money every year in Nepal and tourism coming from the great Asian power is growing rapidly in the last 10 years alone, despite the earthquake, the number of Chinese tourists arriving into poll every year has multiplied by four

Speaker 1:          07:32          present trying to depaul relations are developing at the fastest pace. We've seen you home Chinese ambassador in Nepal. That's how relations between Nepal and China are growing. Hydro power to cement Chinese businesses are already all around this small South Asian country. Chinese Internet providers are breaking Indian monopoly. Chinese tourists are flooding Nepal. Chinese language institutions are mushrooming more Nepali students are traveling to China and to India and hundreds of Nepali officers are invited to China every year as part of an unprecedented charm offensive that's not all. At the end of 2017 elections were held to elect a new parliaments and two brand new government. The communist party's victory was overwhelming and this is a communist party. Very much influenced by Beijing. Now the new prime minister Cardigan really has boosted relations with its northern neighbor to grow trade and investments, but also to gain independence from India because it's number one priority and folks, Beijing clearly doesn't want to miss this opportunity. Therefore, Beijing is putting huge projects on the table to change the whole situation forever. Roads, airports, and the bubble, the promise of a new railway line.

Speaker 2:          08:49          Appreciate because sign up with a other fields.

Speaker 1:          09:06          For example, the Chinese government has announced that is looking into extending the railway that connects to best with the eastern coast all the way to the Nepalese border and there is little doubt that China would have no problem financing the railways construction all the way to cat. Man Do.

Speaker 2:          09:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:23          By the way, we already know talking about a small project APP, connecting Napoleon. China by rail could mean multiplying the arrival of Chinese tourists by 10, 15 or even 20 times. And if the train in addition was connected to the Indian railway network, we could be speaking of a revolution in transporting merchandise between the two. Great giant. If we can connect this railway network, our east West Rail project, it can revolutionize trying to India trade with Nepal in the Middle Cod, God prawsaud, Prime Minister of Nepal. Of course the new government doesn't intend to break ties with India, but it looks like Nepal has stopped being New Delhi subordinates and most importantly for the first time it looks like this country has a clear option for a better future. You want to know our well, listen up future water and mountains. Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, but it doesn't have to continue to be so. Allow me to explain. On the one hand in Nepal is a country with nature, mountains, exotic landscapes, and an impressive gastronomy. I mean, there's no secret that it's tourism potential is absolutely huge, especially if communications with China improve and just we've seen that's pretty damn likely to happen. I mean, who would not like to visit Nepal?

Speaker 1:          10:50          It's not all in fact, far from it. The Paul's great hidden treasure is actually water.

Speaker 2:          11:04          Yep.

Speaker 1:          11:04          You heard that right? It's really water as we've already seen. The pool has huge mountains and steep valleys that have been carved by large rivets and what can be done with all of this natural wealth. Wow. Studies conducted by the Nepalese government and show them the pools of underwater resources can produce huge amounts of hydroelectric power at a very low cost. Basically it's potential power generation capacity could be almost 50 percent, half of all the hydro power that is produced within the United States,

Speaker 2:          11:37          and

Speaker 1:          11:37          that is a lot of electricity. Now, let's not forget, Nepal is located between India and China and very close to Bangladesh. These all three fast growing economies whose electricity consumption is absolutely soaring and the pool, while that may have the capacity to supply them with the cheapest electricity of all. Now, of course so far, none of this has been exploited, but everything indicates that this abandonments can be left behind very quickly. If the country regain stability, investors will line up to finance and develop this kind of project. The only resource we have, like the Arabian countries, have oil is water chubby guy or project manager at the rush of what God. The hydroelectric project, a 111 megawatt plant under construction near China's border and the potential it doesn't end there. Nepal's new closeness to China could make Chinese money Russians to the country in order to finance large hydroelectric plants.

Speaker 1:          12:34          Well, that's precisely what the Nepalese government is thinking. Depaul's new communist prime minister will restart a Chinese led two point $5, billion US dollar hydropower project that was pulled by the previous government, considered friendly towards India. Anyway, the situation now is that the pool is still a very poor country, but with new policies it could stop being so. So will the new government, the able to leave its ideological inclinations behind and bet on stability, openness and foreign investments? Well, only time will tell, but now it's your turn. Do you think that Nepal should bet on China or should it continue to strengthen ties with India?
