Speaker 1:          00:00          So everyone knows that Santa Claus lives at the North Pole, more specifically, he actually lives in these full bod archipelago, which is the northern most human settlement in the world is the only place on earth where you don't need a visa to ends up. However, there are 2,600 inhabitants, must be totally self sufficient and they also have to carry a gun whenever they leave the main town. This isn't a defending themselves from each other, but rather to defend themselves from the polar bears, which tends to roam around the region. Bones which belongs to the Kingdom of Norway, is the hot spot of a political dispute with Russia. Interestingly, this frozen region has a pretty good chance of becoming the next Dubai, although certainly not when it comes to the web, Svalbard has one of the biggest oil beds in the world. Further, they are the gateway to the Arctic routes, which might just become one of the most important pathways for international trade. And this is why small bond is more than an ordinary territorial disputes.

Speaker 2:          01:16          We're talking about a potential new cold war involving the United States, Canada and even China, and today that's the story we're going to tell you about

Speaker 1:          01:33          once. Imagine alarms with open doors for immigrants, no matter where they come from. A place where a military presence is forbidden because it's a demilitarized zone. A place which is a fiscal haven has the average salary of Norway. Well, this place that exists, and it's called SFO boss Andy. Yes, it's at the North Pole. Also, if you want to go to svalbard bad, there's no need to worry about catching a cold or the flu. The extremely cold temperatures make it impossible for viruses and bacteria to stay. Didn't that cap? It's a long year. The and you can find the world's biggest sneaker collection wants to try cognac from the 19th century or maybe a whiskey. Well, Colin's Burger pub is the place to go, so let me introduce you to it's owner, Steve Dorfman.

Speaker 2:          02:16          Many, many different people from many different nations working with many different things. First of all, one of the biggest is absolutely the coal mining company take have been the coal mining company for 100 years actually, and today there is more and more people working with the tourist business service like a restaurant, but also there is a lot of science going on on a small board,

Speaker 1:          02:46          so at the beginning of the 20th century that was a no man's land and only some whale fishing and with daggers at this place. Nevertheless, after the first world war and not all countries signed, something called the small batch Tracy in treaty, it is written, the Norway hold sovereignty over the territory, bounce them off some restrictions. For one, they consented, met Rami. They also can't build a headquarters already strongholds as they must allow every citizen and every company, no matter where they are from to enter the island and exploited snapple resources, and this is how to cities were born. On the one hand, we have long year billion where the majority of the population is Norwegian. On the other hands, there is Barrons Burg with a Russian majority. In both of these cases, these started as coal mining settlements

Speaker 2:          03:33          that every year there is a or two times a year there's like a sports contest between the settlements. Between bars.

Speaker 3:          03:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:45          Tonight you might be wondering where executives of these mining companies pay their taxes in Svalbard? Well, despite being a Norwegian territory this fall about trees, he forbids any country from taxing the profits. This means that citizens pay the minimum required amount to finance their own governance. In other words, fall could be considered a fiscal haven. They have no VAT in their corporate tax goes up to 16 percent, which is even lower than seeing a pause

Speaker 2:          04:11          the last 10, 15 years have been a lot of people coming from many different places. Today. There is like 46 different nations living in, in settlement along all these different nations. Live very good together with each other. Um, and Namibia we have every year there is a lawyer as a title on a celebrating there you have the Russian and you have the Swedish one,

Speaker 1:          04:37          but make no mistake. All those tie, Russian and Swedish people are not coming to a folder just for the low taxes or the coal mines, as you might imagine, getting cold from the North Pole to the rest of the world is pretty expensive and it's not a very profitable business.

Speaker 3:          04:49          Yes,

Speaker 1:          04:51          small barred coal mine halts production and so now you might be wondering, well, if Kohl's nonprofitable while there so many people going back, it's probably not for the balmy weather during winter. Svalbard has a never ending night. Weather is not even a single minute of daylight.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Of course, several people who live that work in science research centers, which are based on the archipelago. Indeed, since 2008 Svalbard has hosted the global seed vault. This is a storage location, people mainly by the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Microsoft in this vault. They restored a vast collection of seeds from most of the plants that exist in the world in case of a nuclear holocaust. Mankind would be able to reply on the planet, thanks to this great volt, but this is still not the reason why [inaudible] is so important. In fact, there is something more interesting than cold polar bears, science or even Santa Claus Sense. The Arctic holds an estimated 13 percent or $90, billion barrels of the world's undiscovered conventional oil resources and 30 percent of its undiscovered conventional natural gas resources. Ah, yes, they have oil. That's not only that. Let's imagine for a second that you want to ship some goods from London to Tokyo today. The fullest discreet would be to take this one, but imagine you could instead do it using this room. You see what's going on here. This is almost half of the distance. This means less spending and faster logistics technology and climate change are making it possible to travel through the Arctic Ocean, and this would be a turning point in international trade and one day this is going to be a reality, and on this day, Svalbard has the highest chance of becoming the architect capital.

Speaker 1:          06:44          The rest of the islands belonged to Russia and to have no human population. Greenland's on the other hand, has a chaotic legal system. Svalbard has a strong political system and good infrastructure. The proof is in this very interview with Steve, which was conducted through skype, but do we just a moment because the best pass, it's yet to come.

Speaker 1:          07:05          The frozen war for the Arctic Arctic oil is under the seat. This means the above. The ground lands of Svalbard has no oil beds, at least that we know of. All their wealth is on these so called continental shelf. This is the underwater lands maps, which extends from a continence no deeper than 200 meters. According to international law, the continental shelf belongs to the country that is attached to and of course this includes all of the resources beneath, so it should be the government of the country who decides whether they want to exploit this resource or what

Speaker 3:          07:35          not,

Speaker 1:          07:38          and yes, both Norway and small bonds archipelagos are on the same continental shelf. Therefore in normal conditions, the Norwegian government would have sovereignty over this oil. But remember what we said about this fall. Barge treating every country can exploit the resources and Norway. You can do nothing to stop them. So what exactly is the problem here? Well, that's the treaty actually says nothing about the continental shelf or anything under the water at all, at the end of the day when it was signed and no one was really thinking about extracting oil from the bottom of the ocean, and this is why news like this makes people so nervous. Russia believes no way is violating the small bird treaty. When the Norwegian government opens three blocks for oil drilling in the Barents Sea close to the Arctic Arctic Pelican. In summary, Russia says the continental shelf of small bald. It shouldn't be ruled by the treaty and to be exploited by any country, but nobody claims that since the legal texts didn't contain anything about this, the oil and the rights to extract it belong to them and now we come to Russia. I might still be thinking that this North Pole thing, business more story. One of the things for backup remix and diplomats to have discussions about while having dinner, but the truth is that Vladimir Putin, vice prime minister Dmitry ragas intimate, a controversial visit to the archipelago.

Speaker 4:          08:59          It's the Cold War in the Arctic. Russia says it's deputy prime minister. Had every right to visit a Norwegian island near the North Pole, despite travel restrictions imposed on him over the conflict in Ukraine, Norway has condemned the trip and ask for an explanation.

Speaker 1:          09:17          This visit turns fall bald in we fashionable tourist destination about the Russians and the last two years it's fall bumps. Tourism has increased 100 percent. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning that all to villages on the main islands. One is Norwegian ends, one is Russian, the Russian one is gold Barron's bag and there's a population of less than 500 people. Incredibly. In 2015 alone, they had more than 60,000 tourists. Visited. Designer. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          09:44          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          09:47          Now you might be wondering why is the Russian tourism is so important to Svalbard? Well, that's because it helps to retain population, but did it in. In, in Boris, bu there are, there are, there are more on the, like a system very heavy there where the coal company is everything and you're eating in the content and it's not necessarily to buy your food so face. So for a better understanding and the Russian sentiments, there is no currency. The mining company, it takes care of everything, something like this didn't used to happen in the Norwegian settlements to but then tourism staunton that brought all new kinds of businesses and as many different people. So they are in the beginning of a process, on the same way as we have been doing it in longer beyond the last, uh, 25, 30 years. But do you watch out because here we're talking about oil and influence in what's my, it's become one of the main ocean shipping routes in the world. In fact, even China is trying to buy property yet, but that's a whole different issue and that's something we're going to talk about in a future video.

Speaker 1:          10:45          So we've given you our opinion here, a visual politic, and now we'd love to know yours. What do you think of small bots? Do you think it will become a new ones?
