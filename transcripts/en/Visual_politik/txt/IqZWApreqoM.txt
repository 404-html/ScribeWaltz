Speaker 1:          00:06          Romania might be the first country in the world to legalized corruption. Yes. You heard that writes, in January 2017, the Romanian parliaments passed an ordinance which allow politicians to accept bribes, have almost $50,000. These bribes can happen without any kinds of legal repercussions whatsoever. Now, as you can imagine, this infamous ordinance triggered one of the biggest political demonstrations that the country has seen for over 20 years just to the government suspending them temporarily, but even after this protests continued Romanians role, the used to living in Europe's most corrupt country, and this ignominious decree was the final straw that broke the camel's back. But the big question is, how did they get to this point? So what's going on in a country that could make its governments passed this cleans of law without feeling any sort of shape? Well, today we're going to answer this question. Before we do that. Let's take a look at the history. The European, North Korea.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Maria,

Speaker 1:          01:12          understand Romanian history without knowing it out, Nicolae Ceausescu, the European, Kim Jong. Now other neighboring countries like Hungary or Bulgaria have suffered communist dictatorships too. But the story of Romania is quite special since Ceausescu came to power in 1974, his country has been isolated from the rest and even from the Soviet Union itself. Can even food started to become scary.

Speaker 2:          01:41          Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:43          While citizens had the meals rations by the state Ceausescu, it spends money building Pharaoh's palaces. For instance, here is the parliaments of Bucharest. The built in 1983 ends and names of the biggest administrative building in the entire world. This is especially amazing if we take into account is that the Romanian population is no bigger than 22 million inhabitants during the construction of the building. More than 20,000 people were employed in the reynolds. 3,000 died of exhaustion, but not only that, Ceausescu forced as citizens to participate in parades and massive shows to praise his own image.

Speaker 3:          02:19          Are they chicken activist? I've met yet. It's

Speaker 1:          02:33          just like is North Korea and comrades. Ceausescu was a master in the art of political repression during the 19 eighties, an estimate of one in every 30 Romanians along stevie political police. It could be a neighbor your or anyone really leaning any solid. You said something bad about the leader, you could end up spending the rest of your days in jail simply just disappear nonetheless, despite all of this being a dictator, it's not a safe.

Speaker 2:          03:02          Joel

Speaker 1:          03:06          footage is from Ceausescu's last speech which took place on the 21st of December, 1989 look good. His facial expression and how it starts to tremble. It was at this moment the audience started

Speaker 2:          03:19          him.

Speaker 1:          03:24          This is how the biggest protest in Romanian history started. Thousands of citizens stepped out on the streets with national flags or the Communists symbols had been cut out. Three days later on Christmas Day of that year, Nikolai, coca school died next to his wife, killed by his own party colleagues. His last words were history will, and so now you might be wondering, well, what happens next? The truth is in such an oppressive regime is Ceausescu's. There were no opposition leaders whatsoever. Just to make a comparison in Poland's when the communist regime fell, there were powerful leaders like Les Waylay, some popular support and helps write a brand new constitution for the country. Nevertheless, who do you think succeeded Ceausescu in Romania? Well, what would be his own party comrades more? Exactly. That would be the man who you see on the screen now and his name is young. Imagine this government was not willing to give up the luxuries that they had during Ceausescu's times, so I was always happens in cases like this. The Romanian regime changed, but just a little, of course, the new constitution allow the other parties to run for elections and the old communist party changed its name to the Social Democratic Party, but the high ranking officials that ruled the country during the dictatorship caps that power during the 19 nineties and two thousands. So as you probably know, if power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Speaker 1:          05:03          That's understanding of this. In 1995, 50 percent of the Polish economy was already in private hands. But in Romania this figure was only 35 percent. So that's something like, as an example, let's take two common terrorists. Czechoslovakia had a state owned factory Skoda that was privatized in 1992. By sharing the ownership among the workers, it's Romanian counterpart. Dacia was not privatized until 1997 and instead of doing it by sharing it, it was simply sold to Renner. In other words, during the nineties and the two thousands, the ruling elite in Romania did whatever they could in order to keep control of the economy and the country. It was only through these actions that they were able to keep a hold on that. Wait, just a second tip, because corruption was presence at lower levels as well in the country that had been so used to scarcity, it was impossible to get anything without a little brian. I want to go to the doctor. Well, bring a box of cigarettes with you and what about to have electricity at home? A whiskey bottle bends everything sorted out and that is how in this country corruption became a way of life

Speaker 2:          06:20          life.

Speaker 1:          06:24          Now you might be wondering, is it really possible for a country to work this way? And the answer is well no. Remaining and saw how the former communist republic, such as the Czech Republic, Poland, started enjoying a western standard of living while they kept surviving on less than $400 a month. This is why in the middle of 2000 Romania requested you become a member of the European Union so that they could get access to some of those sweet, sweet EU funds and Brussels basically said, okay man, I'll let you in, but there's one condition and that condition was the national anticorruption directorate in the year 2002, the Romanian government founded an agency to chase corruption. The national anticorruption direct service for its best few years. This agency was directed by prosecutors connected to the party leaders, so this was basically the Romanian way of saying, hey, look at us. We're doing great liquid. All this corruption we're tackling with cleaning up everything. But then again, not surprisingly, nothing changed. That was until the year 2013, that is the year when a woman came to Leeds, the director of risk, a women ready to face everything and every one and her name is Laura Cod. Router pervasy

Speaker 1:          07:53          seemed to have been impressed by the activities of the DNA. According to one recent poll, 60 percent of people said they trusted the agency while only 11 percent say they trusted problem in just two years because they see his jails more than 1000. 100 politicians accused of corruption during these years. Romanians have discovered all of the dirty things that ruling class were hiding and these are no small things. According to an estimate, corruption accounts for 15 percent of Romanian GDP. Virtually all the public sales had some kind of running involved. Even the Microsoft licenses that the civil servants used has a cost of over $3, million dollars, which we use to pay bribes to different government officials.

Speaker 1:          08:42          Then there was the case of a judge who was paint around $700,000 in order to declare someone innocent. He was actually guilty and this list, it just goes on and on and on, and I don't want to make that the rest of this video, but since the year 2013, basically all of these criminals, they've been filling up the Romanian jails. To the point that some of the prisons have no space anymore, but not only that Romanian society itself has started to realize just how damaging corruption is, but the real turning points came a little bit later with this news. Armenian nightclub fire leaves 27 dead. This news triggered a wave of protests all across Romania. Apparently this could have been avoided if the club would have met safety regulations. That seems the owner, red bribes the local authorities. He could open the club without breaking the rules. This is how a platform came to be called the corrupted cheat day or corruption kills in English through social media. Romanian started to organize themselves in protest groups against corruption. Oh, but just hold on for a minute because the best. It's really yet to come. The biggest demonstrations in Romanian history on January the 18th, 2017 at 10:00 PM. The social democratic government and it's prime minister does or in grinned. Deanna passed an emergency. Bill Pan's. Yes, they did do it at night when everyone was about to go to bed. So what did this decrease say? Well, it said the politicians who accepted bribes for less than 44,000 euros did not have to face jail time, more pay any fines, nothing at all. It was absolutely fine with the law to be bribed up to that.

Speaker 2:          10:26          No.

Speaker 1:          10:29          It should also be noted that they discussed this little welder beating the national budget as normal so no one would notice the change. So now you might be wondering who can possibly data passed such a law. I mean, what could possibly be the official reason behind the decriminalization of embroidery? Well, this is the reason given by the Romanian prime minister

Speaker 1:          10:52          wants to pass the ordinances into law to ease overcrowding in prisons. Yes, this was the actual reason given by the Romanian government and Bam, just like that. Over 3000 corrupt politicians could be freed and he has. Well, it is true that remaining jails were overcrowded, is in a country where money is drained from the system by bribery. It shouldn't be too difficult to find new funds for new prisons. Also, the fact that the majority of the generals, politicians belong to the government pass. It does make it slightly more suspicious. Date your thing. Well, half a million Romanians thought so too, and they took to the streets of Bucharest to minutes after the decree was.

Speaker 2:          11:32          People will feel that they've been cheated, that David

Speaker 1:          11:36          obviously established corruption kills platform. Its citizens learned about this news instantly and boy they did not like it at all, and that is how the biggest protest in Romanian streets.

Speaker 2:          11:52          I never dare to think that

Speaker 1:          11:54          this was possible. I've always thought there was some logic, some commonsense that would lead to a valid law, but when I saw what happened, I knew I was wrong. Protest kept going for days, not only in Bucharest about in most Romanian cities, the first victim of the unrest was the justice minister who was forced to resign on the ninth of February 2017. As we mentioned, the protests led to the government to retiring this new law. Although they have already admitted that this is just temporary. Further, the brand new justice minister to derailed soda has a clear mission to justifying the firing of the general prosecutor. Laura could recheck a basing women who are jailed over 1000 politicians. The government claimed that her agency is running a witch hunt, but they still haven't found a way to legally far her yet

Speaker 1:          12:44          valuating constitutionality, legality and opportunity factors. I determined that at the moment it's not advisable to start the institutional mechanism to revoke the general prosecutor and the DNA chief prosecutor. At the same time Grimsey all news. Government is confronted going to different sites. On the one hand, civil society is surveying his movements. On the other hand, the European Union is demanding that he stopped at striking the anticorruption prosecutor and of course all of the political elite inheritors of Ceausescu's regime are turning to classic conspiracy theories do protect themselves according to them, George Soros and the Rothschild family behind the protesters and they say, of course, that corruption is not actually a big deal in Romania at all. Well, with or without conspiracies, we are still talking about an existential crisis in Europe, the poorest

Speaker 2:          13:33          country.

Speaker 1:          13:40          Now the question is, do you think Romania should jail all of their corrupted politicians, or do you think that instead the prime minister is actually doing something right by Ge criminalizing bribery? You can leave your answer in the comment section below
