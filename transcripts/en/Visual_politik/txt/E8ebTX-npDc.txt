Speaker 1:          00:08          Latin America is perhaps the region with the least military ambition in the world. The government spends relatively little on the fence and in general with some exceptions, creating large and powerful armies bids, not exactly a priority like this. The subjects of the armed forces has been very controversial in the region in recent years, and that's no one's there because the second half of the 20th century, it wasn't exactly a quiet time. The Latin America throughout this period, and especially in the 19 sixties and 19 seventies, this region was one of the territories in the world which was the most effected by military force.

Speaker 2:          00:58          What about Amada

Speaker 1:          01:23          for the easiest? Practically every country in the region participated in what kind of became a macabre tradition of military groups and of course plenty of repression. For example, let's take a look at 1978 in that year among other countries, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Cuba, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama, as even the peaceful year ago when I went under a military dictatorship, and do forgive me if I left anything else because you could see it's a pretty long list. Dictators of every kind existed left rights pro us, andy us harder, softer, but well, they all had one common elements. That was repression. Yeah. In the framework of the Cold War and block struggles, many of these dictatorships, they were supported by the United States under the framework of what was later known as Operation Condo, a sinister intelligence collaboration plan. Fortunately in the military, dictatorships of the yellows, Argentina, Pinochet's, Chile, Alfredo strossner's, Paraguayan Joelle figure raters, Brazil, ends border, Barry's Uruguay. They will all aided by the CIA in order to achieve a single prosecutes and annihilate the political opposition, especially the leftist groups that were supported by the Soviet regime.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:08          of course. As you might expect, the dictatorships forged under the other political color. They weren't any better. Not at all

Speaker 2:          03:14          facts

Speaker 1:          03:16          during this. It isn't hard to imagine why the armed forces issue has been so controversial. Well more than 30 years have now passed since this dark periods, and in this video we're going to be answering several questions. What is the current state of Latin America is all nice? What functions do they really have and do they pose any risk to the democracy and freedom of these countries? Well, that's dive in. He's in Latin America. Before we begin, and just out of curiosity, well let me ask you a question. Which do you think are the strongest, most powerful armies in Latin America? Well, this is always quite subjective, but according to the global firepower index from 2017, which is an indicator that attempts to measure which armies and more powerful and the different parameters. These are the top five in Latin America, first place. Not really surprising. It goes to Brazil, which is the greatest regional power. This is followed by you in this order. Mexico, Argentina, Peru, and Colombia.

Speaker 2:          04:15          Yeah. The truth is

Speaker 1:          04:18          the Latin America is the region with these small list of budget dedicated to defense in 2016, it was just over one percent of its GDP, which is about $67,000,000,000. This expenditure is much lower than the global average, especially because last and American armies tend to have quite a high number of soldiers

Speaker 1:          04:41          to get some idea. In total, the region has over one point seven, $3 million soldiers. Of course, the combination of a low budget with many soldiers needs to outdated armies with plenty of operational problems. Let's take a look at the most important army. The Brazilian army Brazil spends 23 point $7,000,000,000 every year, which kind of on the face of it seems like quite a lot, right? Well, the problem is that the army has 340,000 soldiers, which means that three quarters of the budget goes to salaries and pensions. If to this, we add basic supplies, then the money left for equipment is very, very low. As in the rest of Latin America ratio is a similar. On average, 70 percent of the money goes directly to salaries. In other words, Latin American armies usually have a lot of soldiers and very little equipment. Looking inward.

Speaker 3:          05:51          Sorry. So

Speaker 1:          05:52          if we talk about armies wars and conflicts between countries, we could say that last and America is one the most peaceful regions in the world. The last arms conflict occurred in 1995 and what was later known as the Sun Epa wore this involved Ecuador and Peru, but no formal declaration of war was ever made

Speaker 1:          06:13          is that the trend has begun that has made Latin America a benchmark every time there was a conflict between two countries, instead of threatening each other with bombs and cannons. Those involved resorts do international justice. This is what is currently happening, for example, with the conflicts between Bolivia and Chili over the sea fronts may conflict and that is being resolved at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Live your replies to the lawsuit against Chile at The Hague court for cxs. However, internally well things, they are completely different. We could say that Latin America has the record for being the most peaceful region and at the same time the most violence one.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Here's that between countries, there is no serious threat of war, but the situation is different. If we talk about internal violence, more incredible than that though is the fact that one in three homicides that occur every year globally, it take place in Latin America, so because apparently all enemies there are Latin American military forces to focus on at home tasks such as confronting gorillas, drug traffic has, or just dealing with violence in general. In fact, in the region, it is becoming increasingly common for military forces to replace the police and security and surveillance tasks. The problem here is that evidence shows that soldiers aren't really good at playing the role of the police. Insufficient

Speaker 2:          07:38          solution.

Speaker 1:          07:41          It's what we might think of first. Crime rates in Brazil or Mexico far from decreasing have increased since soldiers began participating in citizen security in the five most dangerous cities in the world. Caracas, Acapulco, San Pedro, Sula, central districts and Victoria have a military presence and well that's not all or abuse extra judicial detentions or collateral victims have also increased with military presence which further favors and feed say culture of violence. This is something that is unfortunately 40 widespread in the region nowadays.

Speaker 2:          08:19          The

Speaker 1:          08:21          is that soldiers are forces trained for war in order to eliminate the enemy, not to impose order and the rule of law to achieve rule of law, what is needed to detectives, courts, judges, local police forces, and even citizen collaboration, not the military. We can take a look at what has happened. For example, in Mexico,

Speaker 1:          08:43          as soon as he became president in December 2006, Philippe Calderon declared war on drugs and placed the army on the streets. Since then, not only it has narcotics trafficking, not decreased, but homicide rates of triples the army. It's simply not enough. They can of course, lender hands in very serious cases, but they cannot be a police force. It just doesn't work. And yes, I do know that corruption in the police as a problem, but this isn't simply fixed by resorting to using the army. And indeed, this actually leads to two other major problems. The first one is political risk. So consider this Latin America's armed forces must be anti imperialist Eva Morales. Well, why do you want me to say to me? Seeing politicians use military forces to defend that political ideas, whatever they might be, seems very, very dangerous. Using that power of force is always going to be super tempting. This is what has happened, for example, in Venezuela where the armed forces have pretty much become something like a Praetorian guard. For Nicolas Maduro has bolivarian regime

Speaker 1:          09:43          as if that wasn't enough. There is also the big corruption problems. See the military industry is really opaque and it's got huge contracts which are two pretty basic ingredients for corruption. Just have a look at what happens in 2010 in the Dominican Republic. In 2010, a major corruption scandal affect the Dominican armed forces due to the fraud and the purchase of eight Super Tucano aircraft from the Brazilian company Embraer. It is suspected that $87,000,000 remained in the hands of members of the country's political and military hierarchy. Lillian Bobbia, professor at Bentley University in Massachusetts, and that's just one example and it's not even the most important one. So taking all of this into account and maybe it would be a good idea to consider some sort of military alliance, Latin American NATO.

Speaker 2:          10:39          No.

Speaker 1:          10:40          Allow me to propose an idea that may seem just the touch crazy now based on what we've just discussed, wouldn't it be a good idea to think about building a great military alliance and alliance in which different countries could organize and provide different units and bodies for different types of tasks? This would have several major advantage. Military influence over political power would decrease and sovereignty would be guaranteed for all countries in addition, and if necessary during natural disasters, Latin American countries could have an army that could deploy rapidly where they are needed. It could also push for much needed Latin American integration and to increase this region's role in the world of politics

Speaker 2:          11:20          x,

Speaker 1:          11:27          it would free many resources, both economic and human and this could be used to promote citizen security and reduce violence rates in these countries.

Speaker 2:          11:38          In a way

Speaker 1:          11:38          the European Union, they're actually trying to do something similar. So while it may sound like a bit of a crazy idea at first, maybe it's not like crazy after all, for example, Costa Rica suppressed, it's all me decades ago and the results in terms of security have been better than those of its neighbors. We've said before here on visual politic that the 21st century is going to be India century and it's probably China and Asia in general. Now we're wondering, maybe not in America too. Well now you've heard our opinion here at visual politic and now it's your turn. Do you agree that soldiers can be used to replace the police for matters of security?
