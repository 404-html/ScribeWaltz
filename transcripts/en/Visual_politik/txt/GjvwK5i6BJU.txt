Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:08          on July the first 1997 after 155 years of British software and see Hong Kong returned to China. It did so as a special administrative region under the one country two systems model. A model whose goal was to ensure that Hong Kong would continue being Hong Kong, the freest city on the entire Asian continent. That means that thanks to this particular political model, Hong Kong has its own laws, its own justice system, its own police force, its own currency and even has its own customs and immigration policy that is very different from the rest of China. So in the day to day operations of Hong Kong it will, it's pretty much as an independent country and well it's going to remain that way until at least the year 2047 maybe that's why he's, since Hong Kong passed into Chinese hands that things have gone pretty well in the city over the past 20 years. Hong Kong's economy has grown by an average of 3.3% pay.

Speaker 2:          01:02          Yeah. More than 1 million people have moved from mainland China to this territory in search of fortune and the city is still an oasis of freedom. Yes, the influence and the interference of the Chinese government's in local politics has grown a lot in recent years. Now here on visual politic, we already talked about this for example, then past videos we discussed the umbrella revolution and Beijing's growing interference in local politics swells the viewer. In the video. Today we're going to talk about another standout feature of this place. I mean, did you know that Hong Kong is the city with some of the most expensive and also the smallest houses in the world? Well, listen up a rising market,

Speaker 2:          01:52          seven and a half million inhabitants and more than 1,200 skyscrapers, homes and Hong Kong are terribly expensive and it's not just homes, garages, officers, and anything else that has to do with the real estate sector is incredibly expensive. So much so that we can find news like this. Hong Kong parking spots sold for record, 600,000 US dollars. All right, so let's assume that you have $1 million and you wanted to buy apartments in one of the cities in nicer areas. Well, in that case, you'd barely be able to afford a 22 square meters or 236 square feet, and that's for $1 million when considering cities with the most expensive premium homes in the world's Pong Kong places. Second only behind Monaco, Alibaba, chief biases own Aladdin's cave jack mob purchases. Hong Kong's most expensive home for 193 million US dollars. But of course if we take into account, but all kinds of people live in Hong Kong and skip and Monica is very particular case. Hong Kong is by far the city with the most expensive homes in the wells.

Speaker 1:          02:59          It's giving you an

Speaker 2:          03:00          idea. Since 2003 the price of housing in Hong Kong has risen by 450% and today the average price per square meter exceeds $16,000 that's the equivalence of $1,486 per square foot. Yup. That means that if you want to buy a normal 90 square meter house, nothing particularly fancy, you have to pay at the very least one point $5 million, which is quite the mortgage. Now, it's very common to compare which cities are more or less accessible by counting how many years of average wages before taxes we need to buy an average home. Well, so let's have a look at Hong Kong. According to the latest data, in order to buy a house in Hong Kong, you'd need more than 18 years of full wages for comparison in cities like Tokyo or Singapore, one needs less than five years of wages. In other words, Hong Kong's situation is totally crazy and not only that, since prosperity is so expensive and inaccessible, the Hong Kong zone citizens, they've had to buy smaller and smaller homes.

Speaker 2:          04:05          And speaking of small homes, could you guess what the average surface area for a home in Hong Kong, it's, what would you guess a hundred square meters, 80 60 well, all of those figures are sky high. The reality is that that's 42 square meters or 452 square feet. Can you imagine living in a house that small? Well, in that case, check out the latest trends. Hong Kong is so expensive that architects are building a hundred square foot tube homes made from concrete water pipes, ra, ra. So some of you might now be thinking, well wow, Simon, that's really small, but I'm pretty sure that's because people live alone in tiny apartments, which alters the statistics, right? Well, no. On average, almost three people live in a 42 square meter or 425 square feet apartments, which is pretty darn insane. And it's not only the homes. The same thing happens with officers.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Awesome.

Speaker 2:          05:07          Him skyscrapers sells for record of 5.2 billion US dollars. But of course, having said that, you might now be wondering, well, why the Hell Oh homes so expensive in Hong Kong? Well, listen up. The lack of land, a myth, massive skyscrapers, tiny end ludicrously expensive apartments. This is how we could pretty much describe Hong Kong. Don't you agree? I mean, after all, we're talking about one of the most densely populated places in the world. All right, so many people very, this'll space pretty much a perfect combination for super high prices. Right? Well, hold on just a moment because, well, this is not the whole truth. The truth is that less than 25% of that is a quarter of Hong Kong's territory is urbanized and only 7% of the entire territory is occupied by urban housing outside the crowded areas, we find countryside, jungle, old villages, golf courses, and many, many single family homes.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Oh,

Speaker 2:          06:21          alrighty. Then so well, how is this possible? Why don't you see it? For years, Hong Kong was considered to be the freest economy in the entire world according to the index of economic freedom. We're talking about a place with low taxes, free trade, legal security as a very small amounts of government intervention. Yup. Hong Kong is a highly capitalist city. That's why it's the third largest financial center in the world after only London and New York, by the way, fun fact here. The Basic Law. Hong Kong's constitution limits the government so that it can't spend more than it makes. This means that the government usually closes every year with a surplus. Indeed, this has led it to save so much surplus that it has over $220 billion in reserve. Yeah. Unlike many, many other countries around the world, Hong Kong does not have public debt. All right, but fun facts assigned, let us continue. The fact is that despite so much freedom and so much commitment to capitalism as a sector in which the government has intervenes a lot and I am betting because you've been watching this video for some time now that you can probably guess what that is. Yes, it is the real estate sector. You see the government owns practically all of the lands in Hong Kong.

Speaker 2:          07:37          Governments. Authorities control how much land is put on the market and when it can be built upon and of course if the development bureau decides what Cam and what cannot be built now generally lands concessions. They're given through auctions. These are generally for private homes, offices or commercial uses. All. They are done directly through agreements with developers when public housing with lower rental prices is going to be built, which is where a large part of Hong Kong's population live

Speaker 2:          08:08          and it's normal even in auctions for the property to continue being government property as they are granted a right of use for an unspecified number of years. So sure homes being so expensive in Hong Kong has a lot to do with scarcity but it's not due to eight geographical shortage. It's due to governmental decision making. There's plenty of land to develop new residential and office areas and there's always the option of gaining ground at sea. Yes, in Hong Kong, reclaiming land from the sea is not a strange thing to do. Indeed a quarter of all the built up areas of Hong Kong are on land that was reclaimed from the seat, but the government, they decide absolutely everything. The shortage of land is a myth. There are over 200 hectares of land available for building in the urban areas. The shortage of housing is real, but that is because of deliberate manipulation of the market by the government. John Right Barrister and chairman of Friends of cycle. Well, in recent decades, as we mentioned before, Hong Kong's population has grown a lot because many people have come in from China. In addition, family size has decreased and many Chinese investors want to invest in this city, which is known for its legal security.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Hello,

Speaker 2:          09:22          this has led to a rise in demands. Burton not supply. This is simply because the government doesn't want to do it. Palm prices will continue to grow due to limited supply. Thomas Lamb, senior director at night to frank. Well now the question has to be, well, why is the government interested in restricting supply and increasing prices? Well, there are at least two reasons. The first is that auctions are a great business for the public pass. In 2017 for example, one out of every $5 from public revenues came from the sale of lands and we're talking here about $15 billion. The second reason, which is much more sinister is that there are suspicions of not very clean relations between the authorities and large promoters, and in some cases, these suspicions have led to convictions. Calm property magnate, Thomas Kwok back in jail for bribing cities. Number two official, you see the real estate sector in Hong Kong is held in very few hands, hands that belonged do multibillionaires. In fact, 17 of the 14 biggest estate magnates in Asia are from this city.

Speaker 1:          10:38          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:39          And well these big businessmen preferred to keep prices sky high and avoid competition. It's something that happens when the government brings various Atlanta market and see in addition increases any new projects, bureaucracy that way. Small and medium sized enterprises, contents of the market and foreign companies simply don't dare to because that have a clear disadvantage. And of course if you are, as you might imagine, all of this has pretty severe consequences. The consequences, the crazy price of housing has meant that despite having a lot of employments in high wages, many people live in difficult conditions like families having to live in 40 square meters, that's 431 square feet homes while paying exorbitant Morgan.

Speaker 1:          11:31          This is

Speaker 2:          11:32          system has also led many people, especially the youngest ones do depends on the government's public housing. And as you might imagine, these are particularly small and do remember that in Hong Kong there's no chance of living on the outskirts or in remote areas because that would mean crossing over to mainland China and losing all of the freedoms that people have in this city as if that was not enough. The high price of officers and business buildings has caused many companies and too many investments do you end up in other cities if the Powell river delta such Shenzhen, which poses problems for the future, but that is a whole of year that we could do another time. But anyway, it's a viewer. That's how things are in the city. This until now has been one of the most prominent beacons of prosperity and freedom in Asia. Only the future is going to tell us whether this will continue to be, and you know what?

Speaker 2:          12:25          We're going to be keeping a very close tie her official politic, but now it's your turn.
