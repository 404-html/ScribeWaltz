Speaker 1:          00:13          Thirty years ago in 1917, the Russian revolution defeated the Russian empire after more than three centuries of czarist rule, the Romanovs were replaced in a violence wave, other Soviet regime, the seed that would turn into the Soviet,

Speaker 1:          00:31          but the results of this wasn't exactly more freedom for the Russian people. How are the. This is not a history video. We're not going to discuss the past, but rather the present and that's because many are seeing the new situation in Russia as the rebirth of a new cyrus regime. But is it fair to really talk about a new czarist? Russia isn't perhaps some kind of overreaction. Well, let's see. By the way, in this video you're also going to learn what is the fastest way to become rich, filthy rich and facts, but don't worry, we haven't gotten insane and we're not going to try and tell you about a great opportunity you're missing out on with pyramid scheme xY, , Z. I'll explain more in a bit.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Around 18 years ago, on the 30, first of December, 1999 are still unknown. Vladimir Putin became the president of Russia and in 2018, Putin will likely win the elections and remained presidents for another six years, so when this next legislative term is finished in 20, 24, cute in that will have already ruled Russia for 25 years and this is a longer period of role than many of the songs from Russia's pre-revolution history. Indeed, Putin has developed a political system with a close resemblance to that of the older Russian empire. Boozing has developed a similar political system, but with a personal touch and just a dusting of Soviet seasoning. On the one hand, Putin's new regime has restored two of the main features of the older ussr, propaganda and repression. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, jailed as 1,750 arrested during protests across Russia. That's right. With Putin and charge, we could say that the secret service and the political police, which once was the old kgb, I've come back to life and they are now known as the Federal Security Service.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Also, one of the first things boot in did when he reached was to take control over television and the media and set up a powerful campaign of patriotic glorification with a clear goal. That goal being to get people to subscribe to the notion that, Hey, bruce and Sarah and Russia's amazing again, all right, but if we consider the use of propaganda rindge, repression of Soviet heritage, mostly, why are we talking about a new saw? Well, that's partly because he has restored the close alliance between the Orthodox Church and the state, but mainly because Putin has consolidated a state controlled by a powerful oligarchy that is similar to the old feudal system or the aristocracy of the Russian empire. You See, Putin has befriended a group of people to whom he has granted control of the big companies in the country and whom he has made very rich.

Speaker 1:          03:06          I remember when I told you we were going to tell you the fastest way to become a multimillionaire. Well, this is the formula, the friend Vladimir Putin, so believe me, I'll consider this. We can talk about Sergei roles again. Putin's childhood friends. He received around $2,000,000,000 in government funds or other close friends like ego section, Putin's old chief of staff or Alexi Miller and all his collaborator and consultants, or there's Sergei tremor, resolve and old friends from the KGB. They are all multimillionaires today and they are the ceos of some of the most important state owned companies. Gazprom and and Ross tack no bad. Right, and do you think for a moment, these are isolated situations. There are tons of examples. Tymchenko, Rosenberg, truck Shama love. It can be definitely said that if you are friends you aren't doing or right indeed. Many of these people appear in the Forbes list of the wealthiest people in the world and it is not just them. I mean these people, they're now getting old and they are passing on that wealth to their children. It is normal to see many of these big national companies that have grown enormously since Putin reached power being run by the 25 to 35 year old children of Putin's friends.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Degas Lucas, Nikolai Shama law, a multimillionaire, friends of Poussin, aunties to children. One of them year. He became the CEO of gas phones, one of the most important retirement funds in Russia. The other Kirill, he was the vice president of sperm. They large state controls petrochemical company when he was just 25 years old. By the way, Carol Marriott's Putin's daughter soon after, and you know what? He's an LV, wealthiest young person in Russia with a fortune exceeding $1,000,000,000. Indeed the prime minister Dmitry Medvedev hasn't been accused of getting rich from the state and having palaces and vineyards all over Russia. I'm actually going to link to a documentary that exposed all of this in the description below. It is absolutely worth or watch, and so now you might be wondering why is Putin doing all of this is just a really generous dues. Well, whether he is or not, that is not.

Speaker 1:          05:02          His real goal here is not just making his friends rich because they are his friends. Well Putin is trying to do with this strategy is grant himself control over the resources of the state as well. Who's paying for this? Well, that would be these citizens of Russia. All right, so we have oligarchy, repression, religion, propaganda for state control, control over all economic and political issues in Russian society and these makeup, the main ingredients of the political regime created by this and use, and it goes beyond Zanny ideological reproach. Look at what [inaudible] Jones, a famous leftwing British person had to say, right wing authoritarian leader who attacks civil liberties, stigmatizes, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people indulgence and chauvinism, nationalism. He's in bed with rapacious oligarchs and who is admired by the European and American heart, right? Russia is ruled by a human rights abusing expansionist, oligarchic regimes, the Russian people and their deserve better. Owen Jones. And while now you might be wondering. Yeah, but what about outside of Russia? I mean, how much power does Vladimir Putin and command on the world stage? Well, as we already said in a previous video about China, we can understand power as influence and we can observe three brunches, military, economic and political. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Rebirth of a Titan,

Speaker 1:          06:24          Vladimir Putin, Russia into one of the countries with the highest relative spend on the military, way above China and the USA. Just take a look at this chart while the US is spending approximately nine percent of the government's budget and China is spending around six percent. Russia is spending more than 15 percent of the budget supporting the army right after the fall of the Soviet Union in 19 nineties, the image of Russian forces was a rusty boats, planes that could fly and corrupt officials that you'd like to empty their arsenals to sell the weapons on the black market who's in? Well, he wants it to change that and today things they are very, very different. Since Putin reached power and especially since 2008, Putin has made it a priority to update to the army. So in the last few years they have spent tens of billions of dollars turning the old Russian army into a modern military force. But even more important than that is that they have made serious upgrades to that fire firepower plains missiles, ships. They are all being updated.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Look closely in 2015 alone, according to the figures of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the army got four ships for submarines 50 to support ships, 27 aircrafts and 45 artillery units, but not everyone shares this opinion. In fact, one former US general told me that a single US super aircraft carrier group could obliterate the entire Russian navy as the equipment is so dated and technologically obsolete. Azeem O'brian research professor at the United States Army War College. Regardless, we could save the Russian army has become a key part of Moscow's international politics, and it is not just this political influence in other countries and international conflicts, but also the renewed capacity of the Russian arms industry. Further, do not forget about all those nukes they have. They have a lot of nukes, feet

Speaker 2:          08:13          of clay. Now,

Speaker 1:          08:16          if we can see the Russian army as an asset for Pearson, the wrecked Russian economy is certainly his main weakness. Russia is basically a producer and an exporter of natural resources and Russia's economy isn't nowhere even close to China's. In the last few decades, Russia has been unable to diversify or develop a complex and productive economy, not even close. Russia is more and more dependent on its natural resources every day. Indeed, they are so dependent on them that everything is great. When the prices are high, that's when they are not a crisis kicks off. These are Barack Obama's words from his final press conference. As presidents, the Russians can't change us or significantly weaken us. They're a smaller country. They weaker country. Their economy doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. They don't innovate. Barack Obama as the oligarchy states and those Putin is creators has a lot to do with it.

Speaker 1:          09:06          The state has simply taken a more and more important role in the economy since 2005. It was then 35 percent and today it is 70 percent and let us not forget that this process has been led by Putin's buddies and sure in this situation, I mean, of course corruption spreads and competition disappears and with those things gone. There's not really much of an incentive for them to do things right, and that's why the future of Russia's economy, it's looking pretty bleak once some proof of this, but in 2016, more than 400,000 people left the country and many of these people, whether young and educated anyway, the Russian model, it just doesn't seem capable of encouraging growth and development in the country and besides think about it, this is a weakness itself. A poor economy means less influence and less potential to develop the military. And finally the third branch, and that's political power.

Speaker 1:          09:50          We could discuss further the moves with China or the Russian strategy in the Middle East where Moscow is trying to take influence from their less than the United States, but I think we should leave that for a future video.
