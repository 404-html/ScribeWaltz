Speaker 1:          00:00          Did you know that the United States is the largest energy power on the planet's? Yep. That's absolutely right. The United States has taken the position as the world's largest fossil fuel producer. No other country, not even Russia or Saudi Arabia. Even come close to this North American giants. The golden era of American energy is now underway. This energy revolution is having important consequences and it's changing politics in the USA and it's also the topic that we're addressing in this visual politic video. Just eight years ago, the supply of petrol and natural gas was one of the biggest concerns that the USA had about their future. And this wasn't a particularly new concern. The country had been dependent on foreign petrol and gas for decades.

Speaker 2:          00:57          The other thing is that we have only leased out and began to explore two percent of our outer continental shelf for oil where it is believed by everyone familiar with that few will and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies you have to be found.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Uh, secondly, we need an active exploration program in market. They only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. I think we can easily within seven, eight, 10 years if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that our national security, if we don't achieve our independence from the most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy. So here's what I've done since I've been president. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. At the time it was said that the national security over the US, they rely on being able to ensure the supply of natural gas and petrol to the industry and economy. That we're so dependent upon it and this well, it wasn't really easy to do at that time. It's possible you might remember this. The world's seem to be facing an imminent decline in fossil fuels. It really did seem as if we were about to run out of them. Let's have a quick look at the situation in the USAID. Back at that time

Speaker 1:          02:24          from the early seventies, the petro reserves in the United States were declining year after year production had dropped by about 50 percent and even the production of natural gas was starting to decline. In other words, the United States was quickly running out of energy resources and they were at risk of having to rely on suppliers well, when it's exactly trustworthy in the opinion of those responsible for national security. We are of course talking about countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia and Nigeria. However things they've changed a lot since then and as sometimes happens, the predictions were wrong and creamed storage tanks, the world all continue,

Speaker 3:          03:00          Phil.

Speaker 1:          03:03          Well, what exactly is happening? Well, let's take a closer look at that. Petrol power returns. United States has gone through an important energy revolution. In the last few years. Oil production has almost doubled, and the reserves which can be exploited guarantee that supply for many years to come. Look at this chart that we've taken from the Wall Street Journal. It shows the increase of oil production in the USA since 2011. You can probably guess the fact that the USA has almost doubled. It's all production is closely related to the huge drops in oil prices since 2004, not just the petrol. Something really similar that has happened with natural gas as well. Today. The US is the world's largest producer of both of these resources and as you can imagine, this as consequences on multiple fronts, but what has happened so that this boom could take place. As many of you know, it is all due to a technological revolution known as fracking.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Well, it's actually nothing new. We've known about it for decades, but until recently it wasn't really economically viable. And look, before we get into this topic any further, we need to point out that fracking. It's a pretty controversial topic and for now it's only used to produce petrol on a large scale in four countries, the US, Canada, Russia, and Argentina. At the end of this video and in the description below, we're actually going to leave a link to something that will explain how this process works in its defense, would also like to point out that it is a pretty new technique and as this technique is being used and developed, its actual impact is being reduced anyway. The safety and that sort of thing is actually a discussion for another video because in this video we're going to focus on both the economic and the political consequences of fracking feeding the economic engine. Civil oil imports to the U. S had been reduced significantly in the United States. Sanders laws of supply and demand applying all of this additional petrol has made the prices drop. This means the lesser amounts of petrol that the country is still important, but it's also significantly the price of gas slash petrol at the pump to faults, so much so that it's actually estimated that American consumers are saving about a $150,000,000,000 every year. This is money that is then used for purchasing other products or setting up businesses or just putting it into a savings accounts, but hold on a minute because this is not the end of today's story. Oh, not even close, cheaper petrol and gas also benefits industry and not just those industries that use this type of energy, but also industry that uses it as their raw material.

Speaker 3:          05:51          Of course

Speaker 1:          05:52          now talking about the petro chemical industry, the one that produces plastic and pvc, the culmination of a large quantity of petrol available, the certainty of supply and low prices are triggering an industrial boom in the petro chemical sector and it's really important to look at these numbers closely because that absolutely huge petrochemical sector is developing projects valued at $185 billion dollars just in the United States. 20 16. These sorts of projects. We're 50 percent of the entire national industrial investment. It's expected that these investments will turn the United States into a great plastic export

Speaker 1:          06:40          just so I can get an idea. They expect that in just a few years, the net exports of petrol based products like plastics and also fertilizes and solvents will exceed $110,000,000,000 a year. This is almost as much as all of the petrol, Saudi Arabia exports. You've got to pinch yourself sometimes and say, this is the envy of the world. Neal Chapman, president of the chemical division at Exxonmobil. It's not your business will certainly help us reduce that trade deficits, a deficit that trump is always complaining about. Let's wait a second because, well, there's yet more the supply of petrol. It's something no longer a priority or a concern for the countries and national security. In December 2015 us Congress moved the prohibition on exports of natural gas and petrol.

Speaker 3:          07:24          Now

Speaker 1:          07:25          the US is about to become a net exporter of natural gas and it is calculated that the US will sell an average of 1 million petrol barrels per day in 2017. US oil exports double reshaping vast global markets. Well, the United States still important forum petrol, but much less than it used to because countries like to have energy security by diversifying their sources. Many countries are willing to pay a premium for this US supply and you can be sure that the companies in the US on taking advantage of that natural gas where this change has been the greatest and so recently the transport of gas was difficult and huge gas pipelines when needed, but now thanks to the new technology of liquefied natural gas, it can easily be transported like petrol in giant

Speaker 3:          08:15          tankers.

Speaker 1:          08:19          The gas supplied this way is almost half of the world's supply and here American companies are. The superstars is now projected to be one of the top three natural gas exporters in the world by 20, 20 less importance. Gas Exports, a revival of the industrial sector. It all looks like rather bad timing for trump's protectionism. Well, hold on just a minute because this energy revolution, it also has political consequences diplomatically. Most of all, to understand the US international politics. If we don't consider the impacts of this energy revolution, let me explain. I'll console now. The supply of petrol was a priority for national security. The Middle East and oil and gas producing countries had an important role in the American diplomatic agenda.

Speaker 3:          09:19          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:21          petrol scheme of the United States. This caused priorities to change. For example, a new focus has been placed on Asia, which is we've talked about before, is a goldmine of opportunity

Speaker 1:          09:33          singly. Without this change in priorities, Obama would have probably kept the troops in Iraq ends. The situation in Yemen, Libya or Syria would have been very, very different, but let's be really extra clear. Have all of this petroleum means that the Middle East is not really that important to the United States anymore. A country that can now even afford to support these so called Arab Nato, which is something pretty much like, okay, well you and take care of your own safety man's. Every now and then we'll give you a hands to hopefully avoid the risk of a global crisis or something. Needless to say, this energy independence has also given Washington the opportunity to place more demands on the petro monarchies of the Persian Gulf, especially when it comes to human rights, and by the way, if there is something that is absolutely certain, it is trump's support for fracking, the new president and wants to continue Obama's work, but to do it faster, eliminating any obstacle that might be in the way.

Speaker 3:          10:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:28          American Energy First America

Speaker 4:          10:32          first, America first.

Speaker 1:          10:35          Donald trump has little doubt. He made the promise during his campaign and has kept his word since taking office is priority, has been to give petrol and gas developments, the green light, among other things he promised to eliminate many of the rules and restrictions Obama passed, which could cause fracking to slow down trump well. He wants cheap petrol panties willing to push to get it sooner rather than later. Trump has also chosen to surround himself with key people closely related to the petroleum industry. As Secretary of state's trump decided to go for rex Tillerson, who used to be the CEO of Exxon Mobil. Then there's Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, who has been placed in charge of the Department of Energy. Thanks. This is a stage that is very closely related to the industry and then there is the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt to the attorney general in Oklahoma, another state, well connected to the petroleum industry.

Speaker 3:          11:29          Great.

Speaker 1:          11:31          Anyway, this is a revolution that the US is going through. I did some revolution that just put greater limits on the power of. Okay, now there is no question that fracking has its risks, but the reality is is that it's a technology that's not going anywhere and it does seem that with time and development it's going to become safer, but until that time comes, environmental controls are absolutely yes,

Speaker 1:          11:58          and now it's your turn. We'd love to know what you think of this energy revolution. Do you think it's the start of a new era for cheap petrol?
