Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:08          a lot of people are wondering these days whether it's possible to put the word Islam in the same sentence as democracy and human rights and to tell you the truth, if there are not that many examples to be optimistic about. Even in a country like Turkey where they have a guarantee of the separation of church and state, they are still moving towards and Islamic theocracy. Nevertheless, there is one country that is escaping this trends and that country is too, right?

Speaker 1:          00:34          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Smith 10 million inhabitants. Tunisia is the cradle of the so called Arab spring. You know that phenomena that started in the winter of 2011 anyway, this is where everything started and more specifically things started in the city of city Bosiat it things kicked off when a 26 year old fruit seller burned himself to death as a form of protest in front of a government building. This is how a revolution spread all across northern. Yes,

Speaker 1:          01:03          I forgot.

Speaker 2:          01:05          And from here you probably do know the rest of the story. In Egypt, they overthrew their dictator only for him to be replaced by a man who is probably even worse. Libya is a failed state that has a high probability of becoming a radical Islamic country. And as well, let's just say it's probably best that we don't talk about Syria. Among all of this madness, though, Tunusia is an exception after rounds thing. Their dictator, Aberdeen, Ben Ali Dune is, Ian's wrote a brand's new constitution, which was inspired by French law. This new tanks. It allows freedom of speech and freedom of religion, but not only that, now 20% of the country's parliamentary seats are occupied by women. This is a very big achievement if you consider to nausea to any other Islamic

Speaker 1:          01:46          country,

Speaker 2:          01:50          why Tunisia has become one of the main targets of Dash. So far, more than 73 people have died in three separate terrorist attacks. And this is what leads us to many questions. Cantonese, he and liberal democracy survive in such a harsh environment. Can tunusia become a model for neighboring countries? Will the European Union help or damage this democracy? Well, today we are going to answer all of these questions for you, but first we need to look a bit at the history of tuners. Yeah, lights and shadows of abby met Ben [inaudible] in 1955 at Tunusia got its independence from France just like other countries in the region, the Republic of [inaudible], the so called Arab socialism or Pan Arab Islam. This was an ideological cocktail that mixed authoritarianism, charismatic leaders, a centralized economy, and finally a secular state. You might to even say it's an anti religious state. This ideology became very fashionable in the area that brought as tyrants, such as Gaddafi in Libya and NASA in Egypt.

Speaker 2:          02:54          In the Tennessean case, the man is the man you are seeing on the screen now. His name was happy, but Bourguiba in summary has government was famous for its corruption. In summary, has government was famous for its corruption clientelism and it's systematic devaluations of the national currency, the dinner. It's really no wonder that the economy eventually collapsed. And so what was the outcome? Well in 1987 presidents Bourguiba was it the hospital recovering from a heart attack? It was at this point to that is prime minister Aberdeen. Ben Ali took his seat. June is Ian's called this events the medical cute Atar. No blood was spills and actually there was no violence whatsoever. Even when Bourguiba left the hospital, Ben Ali sent into a luxury mentioned with a team of doctors and nurses to take care of him.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Legend even says that he went to visit the man often. So you can see that this was a coup guitar, but you can see that it was one with a lot of love and care. So what did Ben Ali do? Well, during his mandate, he sent that he would bring democracy to Tunisia and while he did cool for elections several times, the problem was that in order to run in the elections, you needed the approval of 30 people from the existing government party. This means that in most of the cases, well surprise, surprise, the only eligible candidates was one from the government.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Thanks

Speaker 2:          04:18          soul of this Ben Ali Hell's power for 23 years, 23 years. That of course continued the tradition of corruption that the tune is Ian. People have grown, used to, but now there is something positive we should say about Mr Ben Ali and that is his economic practice from the stars of this rule. He encouraged foreign investment in this, encouraged a loss of foreign companies to establish themselves in Tunisia. This is how several hotel chain started up in the country. You attracted by the great weather. This led to tourism becoming tuners. He main industry followed by the olive industry. And don't forget the latter of those because we're going to be coming back to it shortly. So during those 20 years, tennesseans actually managed to multiplying the income by three. In fact, in 2010 Tunusia boasted over 6 million tourists.

Speaker 1:          05:12          This is about half

Speaker 2:          05:13          the number who visited neighboring Egypt's bar to do. Keep in mind here that Egypt has, well the pyramids and also where population nine times the size of Tunisia. Hey, close attention to the numbers here. Tunusia has a population of 10 million people and in a single year they hosted 6 million tourists. So why am I emphasizing this quite so much? Well, that's because tourists are much more than an influx of money for the country. They also bring with them another culture. Suddenly in a country which is majority Islam, it becomes normal for people to see women walking around without scarves on their heads. But I miss actual people to be seen kissing in the streets and for people to be drinking alcohol. There is no other Islamic country that is quite so exposed to this level of western culture. So if you aren't one of those British people, you've got drunk in 18 izzy and hotel well knew that you're doing your part for Tunez cultural diversity. Well, thanks to this wider cultural exposure, something quite extraordinary happened.

Speaker 2:          06:11          Craddick transition in Tunisia in 2010 the Tennessean economy, it was on fire, but the unemployment rate was 12% added to this word, corruption scandals and power abuses under Ben Ali, his regime. Now, all of these things were of course hidden from the people in the local press, but due to the large amount of tourists, a lot of foreign media was being brought into the country and this educated the people. Now, all of these things would never be published in the local press, but the foreign media, they were reporting everything and it's in a country with so much tourism, what is written outside can very easily be read inside so people knew what was going on and they really didn't like it. This land do demonstrations being organized in several cities, perhaps these protests wouldn't have been so big if it wasn't for Mohammed Bouazizi. He was a 26 year old man who burned himself to death in protest after police took over. History

Speaker 1:          07:03          me

Speaker 2:          07:09          is how the jasmine revolution started. All of a sudden, thousands of protestors gathered in every tune is Ian city. Now, unlike other dictators, Ben Ali didn't confront them, but he simply lacks Ben Ali after 23 years in power and leaves Donisha after this momentous occasion, the presidents of the parliaments off Tunusia forms a provisional governments and fried over 500 political prisoners. Not only that, but some teen, is he a dissidence who were living in exile, came back to the country among them. But once this map Monsef Marzocchi, he was the president of the Arab Commission on Human Rights.

Speaker 3:          07:50          You might wonder now is whether the Tunisia, we are talking, it's Islamic and the answer is no. The donisha where

Speaker 2:          07:58          talking, he's the more private. So a year off the bow is easy, burnt himself to death. Junior Xeo was holding their first free elections and our friends Marzouki would become the first president. So what exactly was the problem? Well, the president was from the Islamist party talking about the [inaudible] movement, the Tunisia, and then it's perhaps more moderate version of the Islamic brotherhood. Anytime when over 100 political parties appeared in Nardo was the only one with an efficient structure. This is why the party one, the majority of the seats in the tunas in parliament, this is particularly problematic if we take into account that this was the party that was going to be responsible for crafting the new [inaudible] constantly.

Speaker 1:          08:42          Sure.

Speaker 2:          08:45          So you might be wondering after this, I wasn't that the tune is Ian Constitution remains so secular. Well,

Speaker 1:          08:52          okay.

Speaker 2:          09:01          Entrepeneur critical uncertainty is the hardcore isn't a, it's created these so called Islamic leaks. Visa of course supported the ruling party in order to speed up the Islamification of the country. This led to violence on the streets and

Speaker 1:          09:13          yes,

Speaker 3:          09:17          Tanisha shocked by assassinations, opposition leaders, Mohamed [inaudible] and Chuck Green.

Speaker 2:          09:24          Meanwhile, the income from tourism was falling sharply. No one wants to travel to a dangerous country and this generated more and more social unrest with this situation. The secular parties created a common front against Ennahda and this is how the Islam is to block, was forced to have secular politicians in their cabinet. Months later, both the Islamists Leagues and the Muslim Brotherhood were considered terrorist organizations by the Tunisian government. And of course the most extreme politicians had to leave the government as well. Actually in some months the whole Ennahda movements and left the cabinet and the left, the decision making power in the hands of the secular

Speaker 2:          10:03          did this with just one condition. And that is that Islam must remain the official religion in the new constitution. So what was the result of all of this? Well, the Newtonian constitution is not based on sharia law and it includes both freedom of religion and freedom of speech, but not only that, it also guarantees a nonreligious education. Islam now holds only a symbolic position in Tunisia. The reality is that when it comes to politics, Tunisia is a secular nation, new free media organizations within formed and to watch followed. This was the creation of one of the strongest civil societies and the whole of North Africa after this. It is no surprise that during the elections in 2014 Islamist parties lost to the secular liberal coalition.

Speaker 1:          10:49          No,

Speaker 2:          10:51          still they believe me about the influence of tourism in Tunisia. Well, we'll have a look at this electoral map on this map. You can see how the Islamists lost in the regions that are closer to the coast, and this is because that's where all the hotels and resorts are. Hold on a second because things are about to get a little agreement.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Ooh,

Speaker 3:          11:11          strengthening Tunisian democracy

Speaker 2:          11:13          months. After two years, he had published that constitution dash or the Islamic state organized that first terrorist attack against the El Barrio museum. This is one of the main tourist attractions in there

Speaker 1:          11:24          country.

Speaker 3:          11:27          As I resolved, the number of British rivals, which looked set to break records in the early months of 2015 has fallen by 93.2% for the first five months of these years.

Speaker 2:          11:40          After this two attacks followed and in total 73 people were left to debt. This is why teaching is Ian Government has a security crisis as well as an economic crisis and to one of them is destroying their main industry, which is why stories like this not quite so important.

Speaker 1:          11:58          Donisha

Speaker 2:          11:59          do you offer $50 billion of projects to foreign investors? Not only that, but the European Union has also eliminated or fairs on the import of Tennessee and olive oil. As you know, in the European Union, agriculture is protected from foreign markets, but in the case of Tunisia, it is essential in order to support that all of industry. As I said before, he says the second largest industry in the country behind tourism, but it's a hold on it for a moment because as you can probably imagine, this didn't make the European farmers too happy. Especially those ones based in [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:29          Yes,

Speaker 2:          12:31          save our quality. Say no due to donation. Oh, well this is the specialty. Funny. You're given them. Most of that oil that is labeled as a made in Italy is actually produced in Tunisia and then ships to Italy where it is labeled and this is where the political battle starts. In Europe on the one hands, it is crucial to help the teen is in economy so they can maintain their democracy, but on the other hands, a lot of European countries don't want to lose their privileges.

Speaker 2:          13:03          Question is, do you think Europe should open its market to at Tunusia? Do you think that it is an important sacrifice to make in order to prevent political unrest in the country? And do you think June is here, could become a model for neighboring countries?
