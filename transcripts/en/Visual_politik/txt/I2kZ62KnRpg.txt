Speaker 1:          00:08          Unless you're living in a cave and your only source of news is visual politic, in which case thank you very much. You probably realize that Fidel Castro died, ends with his death. A communist icon disappears. Fidel Castro ruled over Cuba with an iron fist for over 50 years. Now, many people, ones where the Fidelis death will be the first step in a transition for Cuba, a transition from a communist dictatorship to a liberal democracy. The reality is is that Fidel Castro, he retired from politics in 2008, handing over power to his brother Raul Castro, keeping Cuba really in the family business. The truth is that Raul found himself having to apply several reforms in Cuba. Reforms that it's not such a long time ago would have been impossible to imagine in a regime that touted itself as the perfect communist system.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Castro ism is done, at least the way we know it. No one really knows what will become of Cuba, but one thing is the absolute certain. It's changing. Well. You will ask for a video about Cuba and you know that here, a visual politic. We do like to think outside of the box, so in this video we're answering a very important question that we don't believe has been answered yet. Is now a good time to invest in Cuba? Is it possible to make money out of the political changes that are expected on the island today? We're going to answer that question. History shows us that when an economy goes from a plan's one to a free market, one, there is a window of time where it's possible to make a fortune. A good example of this is the Czech Republic, particularly the city of Prague. Well, I'm making this video. I am British, but I live in Prague now. At the beginning of the 19 nineties, the Czech Republic was opening up its economy for the first time after decades of communism. This means that for the first time in years you could buy and sell houses. Not only that, since the country was relatively poor, the price of property, it was very low. This attracted a lot of foreign investors, particularly from the north of Italy. They were buying property for almost no money at all. Then years later, the Czech economy started growing fast. Foreign companies came and settled down here. Tourism grew and local people started companies in a short time, the price of houses doubled and those people have invested early, became a millionaire.

Speaker 2:          02:35          Very

Speaker 1:          02:36          similar thing might just happened in Cuba, but hold on just a second because this isn't quite as simple as it sounds. Other former communist countries like the Ukraine didn't have the same amount of luck, ends more than one investor who invested in post-communist. Ukraine has gone bankrupt before. Considering investing in Cuba, it's important to understand what's going on in the country, what is the nature of the reforms that are taking place. But before we get into all of that, let's take a look.

Speaker 3:          03:02          Tuition in Cuba today,

Speaker 1:          03:04          Cuba is a communist country. This means that their whole economy is directed by the government for some clarity in the good times, the Cuban government employees at 92 percent of the country's people. This means that almost everyone was working in the public sector, but those were the 19 eighties when Cuba exported sugar, tobacco and all sorts of fruit to the Soviet Union was in 1989. The Berlin Wall came down and Fidel Castro lost his trading

Speaker 2:          03:32          absolutely

Speaker 1:          03:32          the US embargo, which forbids American companies from doing any kind of business with the islands and Cuba was practically isolated from the rest of the world. This resulted in a brutal economic crisis that lasted until the year 2000. This was when Hugo Chavez came to power in Venezuela. As you can see in another one of our videos, Venezuela used to be a very oil rich country and since Chavez and Castro was such good buddies, Chavez gave a lot of money.

Speaker 2:          03:56          Castle,

Speaker 1:          03:59          this was the life raft that we're supporting Castro's revolution. Nevertheless, in 2013, oil prices collapsed and so did Venezuela's economy, and of course we have all that money drying up and no longer went to Cuba. Cuba's economy collapsed as well. Now, at this time for Dell was already retired and his brother Raul had taken the reins of the country. Raul Castro realized that Cuba was, once again isolate it and he needed to change a lot of things or his country was going to get a whole lot. Wes gastros Chinese reform, by the way, just so I should say now, if you're enjoying the music in today's video, it's by a car and composable. Rick Spelled Rak. He's from Columbia. If you like it, you will find links to his music in the description below this video.

Speaker 1:          04:54          All right. Okay. Back to 2013, and Raul Castro and announcing a series of reforms in Cuba. The first reform was the legalization of something called the Quintet Easter's. This is what we would call a free zone, and this meant for the first time it Cubans could start small businesses. There would still be a lot of restrictions. For example, they still couldn't hire anybody and they could only start a business. That was one of the types allowed by the government. However, in the three years since these became legal, these freelances of grains and represents 10 percent of the Cuban workforce,

Speaker 3:          05:25          it'd be tuition before people were afraid of doing anything private because government will take it away from that, but now the government trusts, they went the protesters because they are the future.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Do hold on a moment because there is more. In fact, Raul Castro seems to be following the Chinese Communist Party's playbook, which by the way is going to be the topic of another video which we're going to be launching very soon actually in a very dung shopping style. Raul Castro has created his very own special economic zone. This is the so called Marielle development zone, so well, what does this mean? Well, in sight, this his own foreign companies are allowed to start businesses that were allowed to hire local people and they were able to trade with less restrictions that exist in the rest of Cuba.

Speaker 1:          06:13          Fife foreign companies to Cuban and I'm mixed. One are the first eight companies in the Maria Development Zone, which is to become the main economic goals and through Cuba. Now you might be wondering how is it possible that some international companies such as the Spanish hotel chain are able to operate in Cuba if apparently there's a ban on foreign companies that, well, if you're watching this video from somewhere outside of the United States, then you might well have traveled to volunteer at some points. If that's the case while you were there, you were probably staying in a best seller or Emilia hotel. Both foreign companies, so these Spanish companies have been operating in the country since the year 2000, but the truth is in order to establish themselves on the islands, both of these companies to partner with the Cuban government. This means that the hotels are owned by the local governments, but the hotel chains have a licensed to operate them and they get a share of the profits.

Speaker 1:          07:06          So until now it was impossible to start a company in Cuba unless you were in partnership with the government. So the creation of this special economic zone does show a clear trend or trends that China's oil in the 19 nineties. Further to this, there is a freeing up going on in the housing markets in just two years, over 40,000 new homes have been sold in Cuba. Now this doesn't exactly mean the Cubans have private property and the transactions do you come with a thousand restrictions, but it does highlight that there is a trend going on in the country. Now. The most important change in recent times was Obama's announcement that the trade embargo between the United States and Cuba was coming to an end. The problem is is that still needs to be passed by the American Congress, ends with Donald trump being the next president. It's very difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen with that deal,

Speaker 4:          07:55          but controlled by Donald Trump. The Republican nominee for president secretly conducted business in communist Cuba during Fidel Castro's presidency. Despite strict American trade bands that made such undertakings illegal, it's according to interviews with former trump executives, internal company records and court filings.

Speaker 2:          08:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:19          If trump were to keep the embargo with Cuba, that's going to be bad news for investors who live in the United States. They would lose out to investors who come from other countries which don't have such restrictions. Britain, Australia, Canada free. Hold on a second because there's still no guarantee that Cuba is going to become some sort of free market paradise, especially not overnight. It's not really clear that even if you were legally allowed to invest in Cuba, whether that's a good idea or not. In fact, there are two potential scenarios that could play out. Yeah. One option is that they followed the model of track as the vacuum, which is now two countries, the Czech Republic and or it's possible they follow the example of the Ukraine. Now let's have a look at these two very different examples. Czechoslovakia versus Ukraine. In 1998 tracks of Lakia and the Ukraine abandons the Communist system, but there is a really big difference here. The checks had a revolution called the velvet revolution to overthrow their dictator and the new government led by this guy on the screen now called fat Slob Harville. He sends home the old guard who had been ruling the country meanwhile over in the Ukraine, despite the fact that then got that political independence, they kept the same old political elite.

Speaker 1:          09:35          The president's Leonid, Kraftwerk came from the old communist party, but this is not the end of our story. Just like Ukraine and Czechoslovakia had plans, economies where all of the companies belonged to the government. The first step in opening up these economies to the wider world was privatization, bus, and this is really important. Not all privatizations are created equally.

Speaker 2:          09:56          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:58          took all of their biggest companies and made a calculation of the economic value. Then they divided the economic value of these countries into bounce sheets. If you were a checks, it does, then you could buy one of these vouchers for a reasonable price, something equal to announce a weeks average salary. This is why 80 percent of the eligible population bought a voucher with this paper in your hands. You have the rights to buy some shares in the company in order to help those who didn't know how to bid for the shares for the Czech government. Encouraged the creation of hedge funds, these hedge funds advised common citizens on how to invest intelligently. I check and was able to go to one of these hedge funds and say I wanted to get some shares in this company and that one exception

Speaker 2:          10:39          right

Speaker 1:          10:41          now, as you can probably imagine that was a lot of corruption here, but it also has a really positive outcome. It helps the majority of checks to benefits from the privatization of these national companies and the proof really is in the pudding, yet it's 25 years later and the Czech Republic is as egalitarian as Germany and has a quality of life as high as anywhere else.

Speaker 2:          11:02          Urine

Speaker 1:          11:10          story in Ukraine, that's a different matter. Now, the Ukraine did also sell these vouchers, do that citizens. If you were re Ukrainian citizen, you could bid for a voucher and eventually you were able to use this voucher to buy some shares, but the reality of the matter is that the government never got around to arranging those. Auctions is only really happens with the smallest and worst of Ukraine's companies and the Ukrainians we'll have to waiting for years. They had their vouchers in hands, but they weren't able to do anything useful with them and unfortunately during this same time, Ukraine was also suffering from record inflation. When purchased these vouchers would cost 1,500 American dollars, but some years later they were being exchanged on the black market for as little as 10 US dollars. The average would be sitting at home and an oligarch would come knocking and he'd say something like, Whoa, what are you going to do with that voucher? It's never going to be worth anything to you, tell you what you give it to me and I'll give you some money that you can actually use and surprise surprise. Soon enough, all of the vouchers were in the hands of the oligarchs and there's no prizes for guessing here, but yes, the oligarchs did have some pretty close connections to the government. Then decided to auction off. All of those companies

Speaker 1:          12:25          come. Only those companies that were interesting to the oligarchs were sold, and that is why Ukraine still has to go through some privatizations, but the most important thing to bear in mind here is that in present day, Ukraine, 85 percent of the country's wealth is in the hands of the 50 wealthiest oligarchs. The result is no political stability and they horrific environment for investing. Oh, and that's not to mention the whole war with Russia thing. So if an investor had bought a property in Kiev 10 years ago, they might just be banging their head against the wall right about now. All right, so let's go back to Cuba. Here we have some things that resemble Czechoslovakia and we have some things that resemble Ukraine. For example, in the US, you have 2 million Cubans living. This represents 20 percent of the entire Cuban population. These Cuban Americans have been educated in a democratic system, and this could help build good democratic institutions.

Speaker 2:          13:21          Cuba

Speaker 1:          13:23          does show itself to be the case. Then Cuba could become a place with rule of law, civil rights, and many opportunities for Cubans to lift themselves out of poverty. So now that we've given you the rundown on Cuba and shared our opinion, we would love to know yours. What do you think's going to happen in Cuba? Do you think they'll follow the path of the Czech Republic or the path of Ukraine? Please let us know in the comments below.
