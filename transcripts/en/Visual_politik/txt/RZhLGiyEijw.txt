Speaker 1:          00:07          El Salvador is a small country, in fact, it's the smallest country in all of Central America. Bob, that's only geographically. The country has six point 5 million inhabitants. Population that's larger than Panama, Costa Rica, Belize, or Nicaragua. That's a large population, especially when you consider that to immigration from the country is common according to various sources. Some three to 4 million salvadorians all living abroad with many living in the United States. Don't tell trump it's disgusting. I don't want to talk about immigration is ever popular with thousands of Salvadorians each year, packing up their suitcases and taking a chance on a better future somewhere else. It's rate of emigration from El Salvador maintains itself. Then there might soon be more salvadorians living outside El Salvador. Then they're all living inside it. So now you might be wondering why are so many people so keen to leave this country or you might not be wondering that. It's. I mean, we did have to choose a title for this video, but anyway, so let's have a look at why so many people are leaving this country

Speaker 2:          01:13          training.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Yes, it is true that El Salvador is a very poor country, but economics is not the only reason that people are leaving. Now, before we get into details on what exactly is causing this accident, so let me give you a quick bit of information. El Salvador is a tropical country where you can find stunning beaches like these as well as magnificent nature reserves like this one as well as amazing cultural remains, and in 2017, this is a year in which the country should be celebrating 2017 marks. The 25th anniversary of the peace agreements, which puts an end to the bitter and cruel civil war, which lasted more than 12 years and caused more than 70,000. This conflict was between the national armed forces and these so called Fera Gonzo Marti National Liberation Front. I left wing paramilitary group which counted on the support of the Cuban government. Interestingly, after the peace agreements, this guerrilla group, it became a political party and today they have the presidency of the republic. Quite the remarkable change.

Speaker 3:          02:20          Oh, if you cmcs yet. Now,

Speaker 1:          02:25          while this 25th anniversary, it shouldn't be a reason for celebration. It's pretty hard to celebrate when you look at the current situation that El Salvador finds itself in the violence, the 11th of January 2017. It was a normal Wednesday where nothing extraordinary happens that absolutely nothing. So let me explain. That date ended with a death toll of zero in El Salvador and yes, that unknown events was actually front page news. The reason for this being newsworthy is that als Salvador has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Now. It's to give you an idea of how dire the situation is. Consider this in 2015, 6,617 murders were registered because that is to say there were 105 murders for every $100,000.

Speaker 1:          03:16          This is the highest of any country in the world, which is not currently a warzone. This number is really, truly terrifying and is perhaps best illustrated with a comparison. If this figure were applied to the UK, would mean that there were 70,000 murders a year in the country, and what's the real figure for the UK? Well, it's a touch more than 500 murders. That's a hundred and 14 times less in 2016 to figures were a bit lower, but there were still 4,000 murders registered. This is madness. There have been wars. Well, as people have died. Oh, and believe murder is far from the only serious crime getting down in El Salvador, kidnapping, extortion, theft. That all worryingly common. So we're going with this great news. Well, who's up for a holiday to El Salvador, right? No one. Oh, what a surprise. Now, given all of this information, it's probably no surprise to you that according to recent surveys, it's been indicated that nearly half of the population of El Salvador wants to leave and it's really clear to see that this violence has consequences and this isn't just a fear of crime being committed against you direct sleep, but it also affects the standard of living of all people in the country.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Now, according to the Salvadorian Central Bank violence costs around 4 billion US dollars a year, and you know what? That's not really that surprising. I mean, after all, he wants to invest their money in a country where you can be killed at pretty much any time. Don't believe me. Well, how about this? Foreign investment is the lowest in all of Central America. Even regular people are at risk in El Salvador. In fact, these statistics show that you're more likely to be murdered as a bus driver rather than a policeman in the country. In the last five years alone, street gangs have killed almost 700 bus drivers in the regio. It is known globally, but Latin America does have a serious problem with violence and crime. According to a report from the British consulting from various can. Maplecroft glass in America is the region where you have the highest risk of having a violence crime committed against you. Indeed, six of the world's 10 most violent countries are actually in this room.

Speaker 2:          05:17          Sure.

Speaker 1:          05:21          More incredible than that though, is the fact that one in three homicides that occur every year globally, it take place in Latin America, even within this dangerous environments, but the northern triangle countries of central America really take the biscuits. This area is formed of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, and it is by far the most dangerous area on the continent. In fact, when you do consider, warzones is actually the most dangerous region in the world. In these countries which are relatively smaller, 200,000 people have been murdered since $2,000.

Speaker 2:          05:57          You.

Speaker 1:          05:58          The reality of these numbers is prison. Easy to see why people want to leave. You can't walk the streets safely at night or wear a watch or a necklace or start a business without having to pay some criminal organization. It kind of sucks. So the question that must be on your mind right now, but why is there so much violence,

Speaker 2:          06:18          right?

Speaker 1:          06:19          Trafficking probably on your mind now is just why is this so much violence? Now? The reality is these countries in Central America have not always been such a dangerous places. It could even be considered relatively peaceful until about 20 years ago at least on an individual level boss. This all started to change by the end of the eighties and nineties for two reasons. Drug trafficking,

Speaker 2:          06:42          right?

Speaker 1:          06:49          The drug trafficking. This is a serious problem in the region. Every year, 22 million Americans use drugs and most of them come from South America. The drug cartels on making an absolute fortune.

Speaker 4:          07:00          Yes,

Speaker 1:          07:10          this isn't anything new, but this activity has evolved over the years and just continually found ways to operate a spice pressure from law enforcement's. The persecution of the famous Colombian drug cartels led to a shift in route of the drugs coming to the US. Previously it went to Columbia, to the Caribbean islands to Florida. Now there's a new route that goes through Central America, and this is the first big problem. Central America has become a sort of sanctuary for new Mexican drug cartels from Central America. They can organize their business high drugs and take refuge from justice whenever needed.

Speaker 1:          07:42          It's like now you're probably getting the idea. Experts have calculated that 80 percent of the drugs used in the U. s have to go through Honduras and this has led to an extraordinary amounts of violence in that region. Now to the second major problem, the Morris, for those of you who don't know them, the Morris Street gangs that engage in all kinds of criminal activities like theft, murder or extortion. Then members are usually young people and their organization is relatively horizontal, meaning that they don't have much of an organized hierarchy. They organize an individual criminal cells which work quite independently from one another and do take notes here because it is estimated that in these three countries alone, the Maris have around 70 to 100,000 members. The most famous of these organizations all salvage and barrio 18. It's both usually fight against each other over the control of different territories.

Speaker 2:          08:31          Hi, thinking

Speaker 1:          08:32          violence situation is complex. Many strategies have been used to try and solve the problem and they have all failed. However, two initiatives have been put into practice lately in order to change the reality of these countries and achieve safety for their citizens. The first is known as the traditional task force. This is a security apparatus formed by police officers, intelligence experts, and special units of three countries that we've mentioned. The aim of this group is to find street gangs, drug trafficking and organized crime regardless of borders or the group receives support, training and financing from the United States. The idea of this as clear as Kwon, Orlando Hernandez, the president of Honduras, likes to say we are going to give them a taste of their own medicine. The second initiative is linked to the first and it is known as the alliance of prosperity. This was launched by the Obama Administration, ended expects to improve the living conditions and the competitiveness of these countries. It's main goal is to create jobs and essential infrastructure in order to reverse the terrible current situation. To start, Washington has already committed to spend $750,000,000 in order to support these initiatives. But the question is really, is there any hope? And the answer is well, the sort of has to be Mara Salvatrucha has already communicated that they are willing to negotiate their own dismantling, but only time will tell if it's

Speaker 4:          09:52          accessible.

Speaker 1:          09:55          So have you on the region here, a visual politic, but we would love to know what you think. Do you think these countries will manage to get rid of their criminal elements? Will the plan is set by Washington succeeded? So I'd love to know what you think and you can use the comments to you do that.
