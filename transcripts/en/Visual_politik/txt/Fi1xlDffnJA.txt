Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:08          it's throwing. You might be a country that you've only heard about on the Eurovision song contest. If you watch the Eurovision song contest where the reality is that Estonia is a pioneer in country in many fields, some might even call it the Silicon Valley of Europe. Companies like skype and transfer wise were created in Estonia. This is particularly surprising given the just 30 years ago, Estonia was a part of the Soviet Union. In fact, the geographically Astonia situation is far from being ideal there. Weather is pretty terrible and in the winter they have as little less three hours of daylight every day.

Speaker 2:          00:45          They also have an ongoing demographic crisis that they are really struggling to solve further, unlike most countries, the female population of this stonier is markedly higher than the male population. This means that people find it harder to find a partner and have children. This is why every year Estonia maintains the course of population reduction and yet despite all of this, Estonia is the most technologically advanced nation in all of Europe. In fact, it is the only country in Europe where access to the Internet is recognized in the constitution, but what really makes us stoney or get into our countries all of fame is it's your residence. This means that a person, no matter where they are from can simply fill out a form and is become a virtual citizen of Estonia. But the question you might have in your mind right now is, but what does that really mean today? We are going to explain this to you in this video, but first let's have a quick look at the history of stds.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:42          It's big themes of Vladimir Poutine in 1991 is stonier got its independence from the Soviet Union. Yes. Other countries like Belarus and Ukraine, God, their independence at around the same time

Speaker 1:          01:53          time,

Speaker 2:          01:55          those countries, the new political establishment that had a lot of influence from the old communist elite Estonia was different. Their first democratic Prime Minister Martin Law Form Day cabinets with an average age of just 30 years old. These were young people with new ideas. You had no dance to the old Soviet guard and this is how it's stonier opens their markets to the international economy. They adopted a capitalist system and a fairly unique political system that would become well known for its minimalism. In fact, it is this word minimalism that really describes a stony are better than any other, even if their flag as minimalist and is simply a representation of their traditional lands.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Even their taxation

Speaker 2:          02:39          is minimalist and they have a flat rate tax system. This means that everyone in the country pays the same percentage of tax, no matter how much they earn. In this case in Estonia, the income tax is just 20% with these policies, it's easy to see why your stone, you're attracted foreign investments, particularly from the Scandinavian countries. Nonetheless, this was still not enough for them to grow at the rate they want it at the beginning of the 1990 is less than a half of the population had a phone in their home. Further. The infrastructure which was built during the Soviet era was far for an acceptable, as you can imagine, this is not a great setup for a country if it isn't looking for economic development. Since the country you had no money to invest in physical roads, they instead decided to invest in virtual roads, be countries, telecommunications infrastructure, and just 15 years later it's stonier was the first country in the world to have an electronic voting system. Hold on for just a second because all of these reforms didn't exactly come for free. During these 15 years of forward progress, the Russian minority, which used to rule the country, became increasingly politically isolated. This is why in 2007 the Kremlin under Vladimir Putin decided, yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:53          and this is how the first cyber attack in history, it was organized and yes, a cyber attack on a country that relied heavily on its digital infrastructure was a big problem. During the attack, Estonia lost its administration, which was so dramatic that even hospitals were not able to function. This is why since that day, Nita has had its cybersecurity headquarters in Tallinn, the Estonian capital bars. This was not the end of Estonia has problems manage. She'll crisis. Two years later, in 2009 the financial crisis struck Estonia hot the country. It was particularly exposed because of all its foreign investments. All of a sudden, the country had no money. Plus this was the time when they were supposed to adopt the euro as their currency. So even if they wanted to make the switch to the euro, they didn't have the funds to make that happen. So the government had two options. They could either cut their spending or they can raise taxes. Unlike other countries like Spain, Estonia took the first option. In a matter of months, the government fired over 10,000 workers. This was about a third of their entire staff, politicians and lowered their salary. Reason froze all state investments, which included many construction projects. All of these carts caused the Estonian GDP to fall by a 14% in that year to make a comparison in their worst year during the financial crisis, the u s or their GDP fall by 8% nonetheless, after going through a terrible 2009 Estonia saw its economy began to improve almost to me. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Since they didn't raise their taxes and business policies remained very flexible. Many of those who lost their jobs at decided to start companies. So now let's have a look at that. Unemployment shot between 2008 and 2009 is through near went from a 4% unemployment rate to a 19% unemployment rate at the time that this was the highest unemployment rate in all of Europe, even higher than Greece and Spain. However, the interest, two years, they cut this in half and now they have an admirable 6% unemployment rate and it's the same goes for their salaries. Today a person working in Tallinn is lung thing to be making more money than most people in southern Europe. In summary, Estonia is a model for other countries to follow and now we're going to have a look at the key aspects of this country which did make it quite so sick.

Speaker 1:          06:18          Assassin

Speaker 2:          06:22          ministration it's Tony a pioneer, the idea of creating a digital id card. Now many other countries have been copying this model but it's not something that has ever been as successful as it wasn't a stone yet. The reason that it is so successful in Estonia is because this ID card is actually useful. For instance, during the elections, any Estonian citizen can take this med card, it cause you any computer and vote electronically from wherever they are. There is no need for any sort of registration. This is incredibly useful if you are on holiday during an election or if you are someone who did something

Speaker 1:          06:57          every,

Speaker 2:          06:58          no yours, the hassle of voting while abroad having to go to the embassy and cast a ballot, it's all a big headache. Further, in addition to all of this hassle, there have been cases where boots from abroad have simply been lost further. In Estonia, you can use this ID card to do any sort of government business and that includes paying your taxes and forget about all of those long forms that are the tax authorities making. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:20          lounge.

Speaker 2:          07:23          Darn. Yeah. You can do everything from your mobile phone in a matter of minutes. In fact, the government has access to the banks so they can simply find your income. This happens in every other country including the u s the only difference is that in Estonia they think it's stupid to ask her the same question twice. So you simply go over your citizen profile, confirm that everything's correct and pay your taxes just like that.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Bye.

Speaker 2:          07:50          Hold on for one minutes because the best is yet to come. Imagine that an unscrupulous government employee you wants to spy on your personal data. Well then when that happens you will get a notification on your government's profile. You can even see exactly who that governments employee is, who is looking at your data and then if you want so you can ask them why they aren't doing it. This means Estonia in this regard has a way more transparency than any other democracy, but if you still think this is not enough, here's the part that really puts Estonia over the,

Speaker 1:          08:25          yes,

Speaker 2:          08:27          he residency. We've all heard about these big companies that place that fiscal headquarters in places like Panama or Luxembourg. However, this kind of tax structure is almost impossible for a freelancer or an SME.

Speaker 3:          08:38          I live in Luxembourg and if you want to start a company in Luxembourg, you have to go. You have to start by going to the notary and to go to the notes or it takes you three weeks to get an appointment and then you have to pay a lot of money on. There's an awful lot of bureaucracy and everything like that.

Speaker 2:          08:51          Well, in Estonia they realized that they needed and you citizens, as I said, the country faces a demographic crisis and well, welfare, weather socks. That is why in 2014 they decided to offer their cutting edge infrastructure to the whole world no matter where you come from and so you might, no one's out. Why is this quite so useful?

Speaker 2:          09:12          Of course this is not the same as an actual citizenship and you can't use the residency as a passport, but it is a digital identity issued by a European governments and this certainly helps if you want to make international transactions or open a bank accounts. In Estonia, this might be particularly useful if you are watching this video from places like the Ukraine or weld Venezuela. The virtual card also makes it very easy for you to establish a company in Estonia and you can do that without having to move there or do a lot of complicated.

Speaker 1:          09:40          Wow.

Speaker 2:          09:44          Okay. Well now I hear you saying is stony is got to be a fiscal haven, right? Well, actually no, corporate tax is 20% which is the same as Finland's for example. What is thrown at really offers is two main things, simplicity and to rule of law. No, maybe you think that is too little to offer, but the reality is over 10,000 people have already signed up for this virtual residency. One of them is actually the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In other words, it's Stonier has invented a brand's new concepts. The concept of liquid citizens.

Speaker 2:          10:22          I know it is all big question for you. Do you think other countries will follow the Estonian model? Do you think there is a time when everyone were ones who were racist, stony, and citizenship?

Speaker 1:          10:55          I get home this afternoon. They'll get back to hotel this evening. I'm going to open a bank account, stop my company and become an active. Just,
