Speaker 1:          00:08          Forty five years, it's been 45 years since China and Australia established diplomatic relations. Since then, things have changed a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:21          Shawna was founded in 1949 with this, with these words, John Wall run man's punchy life that Chinese people have stood up. It was an assertion of sovereignty. It was an assertion of pride and we stand up and so we say hourly. I run Manzanar, Eli, the Australian people stand up

Speaker 3:          00:47          through

Speaker 1:          00:48          all these years. Both countries have maintained one of the most fruitful, controversial and interesting relationships in the world are relationship based on stories about money, spies, accusations, infidelities, and many, many conflicting interests because in all honesty, if we're talking about a relationship between two people instead of two countries, we have a great script for an Alaskan American Tele Novella. Obviously this swell, this is visual politics, so let's get right to the point, shall we.

Speaker 3:          01:23          Today,

Speaker 1:          01:24          China is Australia's main commercial partner. That purchases represents about a third of all Australian exports, eight times more than exports to the United States. In 2015, China and Australia signed a free trade agreements and today their trade relations exceed a hundred and $55,000,000,000 per year, and not only that, China is also becoming an incredibly important investor in Australia. I couldn't freak where one in 20 people or Chinese among them, many millionaires who decided to find a safer place with more guarantees for their assets and their lives, such as the scale of trade that financial markets have long been of the view that the Australian dollar is one of the best proxies for bets on China itself. James Laurenson, deputy director of the Australia China relations institute. Of course, this all has its consequences. We already talked about it here on visual politic. Australia has broken records and does not have a national crisis for almost 30 years. Sounds pretty amazing. Rise. One of the great Chinese takeoff had a lot to do with all of this success.

Speaker 3:          02:37          Therefore,

Speaker 1:          02:37          it's easy to understand why when the lowery institute's and important thing tank in the country asked Australians last year, which relationship was more important to them? The one with the United States or the one with China and the result, but it was a tie. This is despite the fact that relations within North American friends very close indeed. However, in spite of this romance, the fact is for thousand and 17 was not a year of love for Australia and China. Check out what Bob Carr, former minister for foreign affairs of Australia set on the subject this year. Australia declared rhetorical war on China. The words being used by Australian leaders are the harshest anytime since diplomatic relations commenced in 1972 with the exception of comments at the time of the Tiananmen crackdown. The Tony's harsher than that of any other US ally, including Japan. As you can see, 2017 was a very difficult year for both countries relations. So much so that a survey by the global times, one of China's most popular newspapers examines the Australia, was the most hostile country to China in 2017. And the truth is that with trump in the White House, those are really big words because we can't continue to allow China to rape our country. And that's what they're doing. It's the greatest theft in the history of the world. So what the hell has happened? What has led to so much dissension between Canberra and Beijing? Well, that A. Look at that, shall we?

Speaker 1:          04:06          The storm. Oh, first 2017, seems like it'd be a good year for China and Australia. Economic relations wouldn't stop growing. Trump's shedding off his best diplomatic skills hung up on the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull himself further sinking his popularity in this area of the world. We had a good telephone call, a very cool, and the Australian government's even publicly supported China, replacing the United States as a main member of the fails TPP, the Pacific free trade agreements. We could almost say those in telanovela terms. Love was about to triumph. However, the good times didn't last long and everything started to go wrong about halfway through the year and it went really wrong. Yes, they have had clashes before, but nothing really major in recent years. The Australian government has followed a strategy that basically it consisted of trying to balance that position between Beijing and Washington.

Speaker 3:          05:08          To

Speaker 1:          05:13          don't make matters, it was all Beijing and insecurity and defense matters. It was a Washington. We already mentioned on visual politic that Republicans consider Australia to be the US is best ally and so should be. Australia is the only country that has intervened in every major us walk and for years the military relations have been so tight that Australia has become for us as spearhead in this area of the world.

Speaker 3:          05:38          Awesome.

Speaker 1:          05:40          The Australian prime minister himself is trimmed as great appreciation for the United States saying the peace and stability of a region has been enabled by consistent us global leadership. While that leadership would not have been possible without the hard power of fleets and armies, its greatest potency has come from the values we embodies. Through all the twists and turns of history, the United States has stood for the values on which it's great. Republic was founded, freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. Malcolm Turnbull. Let's get back to the Chinese matter. See, these words were pronounced on June the second 2017. That was the first time in Australian prime. Minister spoke so clearly in favor of Washington in a speech which was also full of warnings to China. Such a dark view of our future would see China isolating those who stand in opposition to or are not aligned with its interests.

Speaker 1:          06:28          And then just eight days later the media storm broke out. It says espionage and foreign interference against Australian interest is extensive. Several news organizations reported on a single story. The Australian intelligence agency was making very serious warnings about the Chinese government's intentions to influence Australian politics through various means, including purchasing politicians, journalists, and scientists. All these surveillance and intimidation of citizens belonging to the Chinese community in Australia. The scans it was unleashed suddenly knew, started to emerge on the collaboration Australian universities and scientists with Chinese military contractors for former politicians. It's not chance the former Trade Minister Andrew Rob, who now works for companies controlled by the Chinese government in exchange for juicy salaries, but amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Speaker 3:          07:18          Yes,

Speaker 1:          07:21          of course. The Australian security services, fear of Chinese espionage certainly isn't new. Various Australian governments have been blocking Chinese corporate operations for years, and so I've also banned companies such as quite way from participating in deploying a national broadband network. This is all precisely because of a fear of espionage or excessive Chinese influence. However, despite everything, controversy and tension had never gone this far, but reports have suggested that the Chinese Communist Party has been working to covertly interfere with our media or universities and even the decisions. Elected representatives right here in this building in the parliament. Malcolm, on December the twelfth, 2017, Sam Dastyari, Labor Party senator and one of the most promising political figures in the country was forced to resign because of his ties to China.

Speaker 2:          08:10          I said earlier in the statement that I am a patriotic Australian. I meant that with all my heart and I leave the Senate with nothing but good thoughts for our country and for our people.

Speaker 1:          08:23          Among other things, he was accused of receiving money in exchange for speeches that favored the Chinese government's interests and even have alerting a Chinese businessman linked to the communist party that he could be being investigated by Australia's intelligence agencies and that his phone could be tapped well. Scientists collaborating with Chinese military contractors, university in filtration, paying journalists, buying politicians. These accusations had been running since the beginning of June. The Australian government announced it publicly and began modifying its legislation on espionage, treason, immigration, and on financing political parties and this dvr. It looks like it's only just the beginning. It is no secret that China is very active in intelligence activities directed against us. The consequences of these cooling political relations can be seen. For example, in foreign policy, we can clearly say that in 2017, Australia has been favoring the United States like never before, but don't think that this position has been unanimous among the political class or at all. In fact, the government doesn't seem to understand the economic importance of the relationship with China or the strategic issues involved. We're putting all of our faith and our relationship with China through the foreign policy lens of the US, Paul Keating, Australian former prime minister, and you know what, given the circumstances, I think that this entire database on the position Australia should take regarding China is quite understanding.

Speaker 1:          09:53          On the one hand, many critics affirmed that there isn't enough evidence of the Chinese interference that the government denounces some even say that this is all a political operation fed by Washington now on the other is breaking with China or at least being this forceful with the Beijing government isn't exactly easy for Australia, and now you might be asking, well, why is this? Well, check this out. China defends itself.

Speaker 1:          10:25          Israel, this entire political crisis. China has been very strong. Of course they have denied all accusations and have even said that this entire campaign is based on racial prejudice and anti Chinese paranoia. This paranoia they've claimed is turning into clear hostility towards the Chinese community in Australia itself. Chinese diplomats warn students in Australia to stay alert to safety risks after spate of attacks. Yes, these types of messages may seem exaggerated, especially because the truth is that beyond a few posters in one university or another, there seems to be no evidence of this acclaimed danger, but although this claim shows us how things off, it's also kind of a warning because clearly it isn't good publicity. Allow me to explain myself. Yet, Chinese students account for four out of every 10 foreign students in Australian universities and they spend $18,000,000,000 in the country every single year. It seems that Xi Jinping's governments wants to make it very clear that it is willing, if necessary, to play in economic terms as a pressure measure. This is something that by the way, they have used recently with both South Korea and Taiwan

Speaker 3:          11:39          and

Speaker 1:          11:39          we are only talking about students here, but also about tourists and investors. For example, in recent years, the luxury sector has experienced a huge economic boom in Australia and you know why? Well, listen to this, students, tourists and Chinese residents in Australia are responsible for up to two thirds of all luxury retail sales in Sydney and Melbourne and had as another example. China's direct investments in Australia of multiplies not by 10 by 20, but by 32 inches, nine years, so as you can see, slowing down this entire process could translate into a lot and that is a lot of pain for the Australian economy, but dear viewer, that is simply the way things are. So far, the Australian government remains faithful to its close relationship with Washington. The United States seems to have secured an alliance that is essential for their interests in this area of the world and for that military industry. In recent years, Australia became one of the U. s is best customers, and in the next decade they expect to spend more than a hundred billion dollars. Renewing their armed forces were American contractors have a big advantage.

Speaker 1:          12:49          However, there all more than a few people then it's by people here. I need politicians, businessmen, and citizens to Australia to remain neutral and protect its national security without having to make so many public accusations. So now the question becomes, well, how is this story going to end? Well, one of the most fruitful relationships in recent years be at risk. Well, when the time is going to tell, but now it's your turn. Where do you think Australian politics should turn?

Speaker 2:          13:35          And so we say at our yard run Manzano, Eli, the Australian people stand up. It is no secret that China is very active in intelligence activities directed against us.
