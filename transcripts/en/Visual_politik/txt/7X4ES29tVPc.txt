Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:09          how many people? Japan is still pretty mysterious and that's not only because it's a country where people push that dog's arounds in prams and drink coffee in places full of cats mode at all. In fact, just like being an overpopulated area with scarce natural resources, Japan is one of the richest and most developed countries in the world with the highest average life expectancy on the planet.

Speaker 1:          00:31          It's

Speaker 2:          00:34          so, it's no wonder that it tends to amaze us in the west, but hold on. Amendments here because Japan wasn't always the economic powerhouse that we know today. In fact, it was quite the opposite until the mid 19th century. This country operated under a political and economic system that was very similar to medieval a Europe's at that time, Japan was a poor and backward territory, closed off to the world with a strongly stratified society. Now the question is, how did the great change occur? How did Japan managed to her eyes up from its status as a poor rural country to that of a great industrial power?

Speaker 2:          01:11          Was it all because of the influence and help of the United States after the Second World War? Was it the result of a meticulously designed the plan by the government? Well, we can say that this entire process involved to major stages. We'll talk about the first one in this video, which began 150 years ago with these so called Meiji Restoration and yes, this did happen 150 years ago. 2018 is the hundred 50th anniversary of this happening. The second stage, which we're going to talk about in a future video, and don't forget to subscribe, so you get that began at the end of the Second World War. But having said this, let's stop with the story. So here we go. Meiji restoration 150 years ago, the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and did the dominance of the Tokugawa, a clan of it for more than 250 years in 1603 and virtually supplanters of the emperor's power, turning them into the great lords of Japan. We're talking about a long period during which Japan remained isolated from all contact with the outside world and well many western countries were throwing themselves into the industrial revolution. This isolation calls Japan to retain social, political, and economic structures that were more similar to the Middle Ages than modern times. At that time, Japan was a feudal society, dominated by warlords. Zenned for no less than 14 centuries had behaved like a kind of vassal state of the Chinese emba.

Speaker 2:          02:44          All of this very, very different from the Japan that we know today. We're talking about a country that prohibited the use of its ports by foreigners to stop their interference from contaminating the local culture and traditions. Of course, that also ended any trade and any possibility that it's political estates would move to the beat of the Times. This was the situation until in 1853 a modern u s fleet arrived in Tokyo Bay with a mission and a message. Either the Japanese authorities excepted ends allow trade or that half to face the consequences steamboats the hawks of the Pacific break their rest. Four boats are enough to make us lose sleep. At night. Japanese poem referring to the American ships that arrived in the country in 1853 obviously the fall less developed Japanese institutions could do little in the face of a modern technologically advanced war fleet, so they had no choice but to accept and it

Speaker 2:          03:48          that was the beginning of the end of the Tokugawa regime within a few years, disgusted by the morven palpable loss of sovereignty by the humiliation of feeling like a poor and and capable of country, and having seen the decline of the Chinese Empire, the Samurai Samurai, which by the way were much more modern than those we usually see in movies, took control and they restored imperial Japan. We're talking about the well known Meiji Restoration, which against all odds launched Japan into the arms of a broad reform program that changed practically every field off to rule given the enormous technological, economic and military superiority of the western powers. The best way to preserve Japan sovereignty equals to take notes and to promote the country's development. I do. You know what? While they did just that within a few years, not even the Japanese themselves could recognize Japan. These are the steps of the country followed to jump from the feudal age right into the modern world. So listen up

Speaker 2:          04:49          at the political level, many of the old institutions were terminated and an independent judiciary power, a bicameral legislature and a modern prefectural system were introduced to govern the countries, various regions. The old taxes on the sale of rice were replaced by a lamb's tax, which had two huge advantages. First, it facilitated the calculation of the revenues the government obtained each year after all, nick amounts of lands doesn't change, but the rice production does change every year, which allowed the government to, for example, design finance and build several infrastructure projects. This then help the time and lands ownership with precision establishing a modern property rights system for it. Yeah, well that was not all being aware of the importance of knowledge and new technologies in 1872 just four years after the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government to establish a universal primary education system because within a few years the Tokyo Institute of Technology and the University of Tokyo were create it. And of course in addition to everything we've seen, Japan is openness was also encouraged. Foreign experts and professionals we have attracted to transmit their knowledge and many Japanese students were scholarships to study both in Europe and in the United States. The results of this whole process was that in just 50 years Japan managed to go through it's own industrial revolution. That's one third of the time it took Europe

Speaker 2:          06:17          that way. In the following decades Japan continued. It's take off process and completely changed and that's also when it began extending its influenced up neighboring countries like Korea, China, Russia and Taiwan in 1902 cause they also signed a friendship agreement with Great Britain and agreements. And this not only boosted its industry, but when World War One arrived, it enabled Japan to become an important supplier, further boosting its economy. In these years, many Japanese entrepreneurs became million ads for one reason or another. In the ends, when countries boost their trade, every party usually benefits. Mr. Trump. Take note here, but folks, that's how we got to the year 1926 the year when the darkest time in Japan began.

Speaker 1:          07:05          Nope.

Speaker 2:          07:06          War Economy, 1926 the, yeah, that's Emperor Hirohito ascended the throne where he remained all the way until 1989 and from that exact moment in the 1920s Japan began to deepen its most warlike profile. In 1931 Japanese troops occupied the Chinese province of Manchuria where they not only committed and enormous number of crimes, but in occupying the province, they also triggered the tense relations between Japan and most of the western powers. And that's not once everything he said came to power, the government again, to boost the war industry to such an extent that in 1931 while the trips invaded Manchuria Japanese government authorized and encouraged the creation of cartels among large companies, especially among the heavy industry. That is to say the industry related to steel boat machinery, truck construction, et cetera. That way the government is good urge launch companies do agreeing to increase production as quickly as possible if while limiting the entry of new competitors, and that's not all in the following years. The government also injected a lot of capital into these companies until it became co owner of several of them. All the while our military spending, it just wouldn't stop growing. Of course, this massive amounts of government intervention in the economy, they had had consequences. It's more businesses were ravaged and almost every civilian industry closed long before the U s bombing during World War Two the consequences of this war economy didn't only lead to a more authoritarian governments since a greater military influence, which ultimately ended up in a war, but also in the general impoverishment of the Japanese.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Yes.

Speaker 2:          08:52          Now, of course, military material had to be produced of goods that would improve people's lives on a day to day basis. More rifles, less soon machines ended up with the country being much poorer in the end. You know what? It's not strange at all. History teaches us that militaristic policies tend to be very efficient and boost the power of the elite. Well, impoverishing the majority. The fact is that as we all know, at the end of World War Two Japan wasn't only a defeated country, the Japanese economy, it was shattered and the Japanese had gone back decades in terms of their standard. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:30          Living

Speaker 2:          09:32          all this, of course, in addition to the tragedy of having lost more than 3 million lives during the conflicts,

Speaker 1:          09:39          nope.

Speaker 2:          09:40          Some of you may be wondering, well, what happens after the war? How did Japan managed to become such a great power within just a few years? Well, folks, we're going to get into those answers in a future video here on visual politics. So far in this one, we've already seen how Japan made the great leap and went from the Middle Ages to the modern wells, and in the future we're going to explore even more.
