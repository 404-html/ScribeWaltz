Speaker 1:          00:08          The situation has been tense for years. It's on June the fifth, 2017. Suddenly the conflict reached another dimension, Arabia, the Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt announced the fulminating rupture of their relations with the emirate of Qatar, including the closing of borders and the prohibition of the use of ports of asked.

Speaker 2:          00:31          Nice.

Speaker 1:          00:33          Certainly old communication was cut off. It was practically a total block aid. The next night planes and cargo ships bound for Qatar were forced to change course, not even the camels were spared. The Saudis immediately expelled is no less than 12,000 camels that were grazing in that country. Yep. You heard that right? So were there any land border closed up in practical terms, the emirate of Qatar went from being a peninsula to becoming an island, threatens by its neighbors, by land, sea, and air. At the time this was happening, these questions were asked, how long can guitar hold on for? Are we facing the preview to a military intervention and has this emirate splendor reached its end? Well, today in this video we're going to see exactly what happens, how things are today, and what we can expect in the future results. Now we are going to see the results, but first, what you might be wondering, bow, did they get into this situation in the first place? What the hell happened as an almost all disputes. There are lots of reasons on the table, but the truth is that the regardance Abu Dhabi government swept tires. If Guitar always being free than to bubble, they wanted to cast off their growing relations with Iran and closed down Al Jazeera once and for all.

Speaker 2:          01:54          In fact,

Speaker 1:          01:55          these were the basic conditions that were imposed on guitar in order to start a dialogue after agreeing on the blockades conditions that Doha outright rejects it. But having said all of that, let's get right to the point at first, everyone bed that this whole mess would be temporary and that it would resolve relatively quickly one way or another. After all, who would think that such a small country, the country that has barely 2 million inhabitants and that is practically a desert, would be able to resist for very long without simply giving up. It seems pretty impossible, right? Well, to view it, that's precisely what is happening. It has not resulted in the way they wanted it to. They wanted to take control of our decisions and get us to comply with their demands that has failed. Katara will never be for sale to the blockade in countries or to anyone else.

Speaker 1:          02:42          We are a sovereign country. We will remain a sovereign country safe. I'll punny, director of Qatar's government communications office. As you can imagine, throughout the first few hours, the emirate underwent a very, very tense situation. Many supplies including basic products such as food stopped arriving, the stock market collapsed, and even the option of military intervention didn't seem far fetched. After all, the smoke Itsari army was no match for the billion dollar war machines of its neighboring countries. Now, a successful intervention that dependent on the approval of the United States, which has one of its most important military bases in the world located in guitar, even though this approval was likely just in case heart decided to ask for Istanbul's help, Turkish parliament approved spill to deploy troops in Qatar the situation well, it was looking to be quite difficult and quite complex, but hold on a moment because Qatar well bad, another ace up their sleeve as we told you, you in a previous video in recent years, the Emirates, they've done their homework thanks to its oil and especially natural gas exploitation. If the country has managed to accumulate a fortune of more than $300,000,000,000 a fortune by the way that they've invested all over the planet.

Speaker 2:          04:04          Yes,

Speaker 1:          04:08          and not only that, but it also managed to become a country that's much more open to the world as a country with a foreign policy that's independent of its. It's precisely what made this blockade total failure.

Speaker 2:          04:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Blockade Strategy was corner us economically that has completely failed and it will not work. Alisha reef, I'll mid finance, minister of Qatar. You see, in recent months the stock market has recovered investors, they've stopped running away and even though many prices rose due to the blockade, even the international monetary funds in a report published on March the fifth, 2018 stated that the Qatari economy would grow by almost three percent this year.

Speaker 2:          04:50          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:53          x is that the country hasn't only managed to open new commercial rates and achieve alternatives to transport it's merchandise. Many multinationals like aged in Dubai, you can no longer send that. People by playing to Doha have decided to open that own officers there. This means that, for example, the number of companies in the financial center has grown by 70 percent in the last year, past 15 years. We were the fastest growing economy on the planet. You're talking about a $6,000,000,000 economy in 2000 turning into a $200, billion dollar economy in 2015. The blockading countries tried to make businesses decide between them and Qatar, but they backed away. Yusuf Mohammed, al Qaeda, the head of the Qatar financial authority to view it. It might actually seem that this blockade might actually ends up helping Qatar if you don't believe me well, perhaps listens to this in Qatar. Kate, it has clearly been a challenge for the Qatari economy and their society. Having an isolated country like that. It's generally a really terrible deal now, precisely due to that during this time, one of the Emirates government's biggest priorities has been to compensate for the blockades, negative consequences, and convince investors that cutoff is still a good country to invest in

Speaker 1:          06:29          and to try and gain a lot of influence around the world. This is something that's indispensable to prevent it to nate as especially Saudi Arabia from guessing future expansionist temptations, but now you may be wondering, well, how can they achieve out of this?

Speaker 2:          06:50          Well,

Speaker 1:          06:51          one way is by pushing reformance and that's something they've done in recent months. The Qatari government has promoted several changes to improve the country's image in the world and to be more competitive for international investors.

Speaker 1:          07:06          For example, visas have been removed for more than 80 countries. The rights of foreign residents have increased and more free zones have been established. Further two very important changes have been announced for one, they called for elections for the very first time to elect members for the consultive assembling something like a local parliaments. Now this is a pretty limited parliaments, but at least it's a step in the right direction and this is a particularly important step when we account for the fact that we're talking about is a place that still works with a political system based on absolute monarchy and for another. The more than reprehensible could follow system will be coming to an end. This is a system that makes foreign workers, especially the poorest, have to rely on their employers for that visa and legal status and has very few legal repercussions for exploitation making, working conditions very, very bad.

Speaker 1:          07:54          In some cases, you've probably heard of the allegations about slave workers in the Persian Gulf. Well, this is what we're talking about. However, now with the latest labor changes, all of these workers will have better protected rights and we'll be able to change jobs or leave the country whenever they want. All of these reforms would have taken a lot longer were it not? For the blockade, it's been a blessing in disguise when it comes to business. You see Mohammed algae, Aida, head of the Qatar financial authority. In other words, the blockade is achieving things that the international community has been demanding for years, but having said that, we still have a very, very important question to answer. Do you know what Qatar strategy has been to gain influence in the world and strengthen its position? Well, listen up

Speaker 2:          08:45          the strategy. We

Speaker 1:          08:53          all know that there are very economic sectors in the welds. Well, two industries in particular, standout one due to its ability to influence politics and another due to its ability to influence society. Yes, I'm talking about the military industry and the entertainment industry and you know what? It's precisely in these industries that Qatar has concentrated its strategy.

Speaker 1:          09:19          In recent months, the Qatari government has announced military contracts for more than $25,000,000,000 and yes, one of their objectives is to equip that army to, if necessary, make invasions more difficult. But the truth is that no matter how much they invest in weapons, Catala Williams be able to replicate Saudi Arabia's military power. But wait just a moment because there's another objective, what better way to influence Washington and get support than by making an industry that practically every government in the world consider strategic happy. In this case, most of the contracts went to the United States and European countries that didn't support the blockade is whether United Kingdom, France and Germany, planes, tanks, helicopters, Ms Dot [inaudible] is buying everything. Of course it's never going to be able to reach Saudi Arabia's level, but it hasn't suddenly become a very prominent clients. Yes. The truth is that Qataris are really experts in contracting security policies. Hello, by the way, don't hire resorts to announced that he wants to invest more money in our indies, a based in the United States military has in the country. This is a base with more than 10,000 soldiers and 100 deployed aircrafts including b, Fifty two bombers. As we mentioned, it is one of the most important to United States spaces in the world.

Speaker 2:          10:42          Yes,

Speaker 1:          10:42          it's really from Qatar where the United States projects it strengthened the area and this includes Fritz incursions into Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, etc. Etc. Etc. By the way, the base cost a billion dollars and was a gift from the qatari government who also contributes to their expenses for. YEah, so yeah, suffice to say it was really quite a bargain for washing

Speaker 3:          11:03          for us. Thanks. cut her fridge. Standing support of america's commitment to read, no security to include the information sharing and encountered at first

Speaker 1:          11:13          and just in case our signs, an agreement with Turkey to establish a naval base in its territory. Now in the other industry, the entertainment industry, guitar has Been moving like a fish in water for years, especially as far as sports are concerned.

Speaker 2:          11:34          In 2022,

Speaker 1:          11:35          the country will host the world cup in 2012. It bought psd, francis most important football team and doha. The country's capital has been an olympic contender several times and also knew that so they also created bind sports and al jazeera subsidiary that has become one of the largest sports competition broadcasting rights owners in the world. Well, after announcing the blockades, the qatari authorities decided to reinforce the strategy, which for example, there's the psg to spend billions and billions of dollars on signing

Speaker 4:          12:05          along with joining psg on a five year contract, and $354 million dollars. Name are also committed to act as spokesmen for the Qatar world cup in this way, not only did psg acquire the player who would elevate the team's presence on the european stage, but cut are obtained, a symbol of it's defiance in the face of it's attempted isolation of doula. I'll rn assistant professor of history at georgetown university school of foreign service in Qatar,

Speaker 1:          12:32          well with the military industry, with football and by pouring millions of dollars into Washington lobbyists, the Qatari government hopes to reinforce its position and improve its image. Now, of course, that rivals are also beginning to make moves. Say the battle is not over yet, but that's something we can talk about another day. For now, it's your turn.
