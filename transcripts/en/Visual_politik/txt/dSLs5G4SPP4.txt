Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07          often people think that Switzerland's wealth comes only because of their status as a fiscal haven. But think about it. There are other countries like Panama, Cypress, the Republic of Liberia, these all fiscal haven's too, don't forget Africa, not 70 offers low taxes to international companies, but it also offers them Pasadena passage. Let's still, these countries remained low income countries. While Switzerland's remains one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and all of this comes with them having no natural resources not compromising on democracy or human rights.

Speaker 1:          00:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:42          Switzerland has one of the most egalitarian political systems in the world, and its welfare system is as good as that of Norway, Denmark. Additionally, their citizens, and not only have the right to vote every four years, but every four months, this was, don't just choose their leaders, that they choose their policies with referendums happening several times a year, Switzerland has one of the world's best political systems, and we believe that this is the reason that they are successful. In fact, we think that the Swiss system should be a model for other countries. And in this video we're going to tell you why.

Speaker 1:          01:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:18          reason number one, the centralization from a practical point of view, it's Switzerland is what is known as a confederation. In fact, it's the only confederation that exists on the planet. It is made up of 26 states which are cold cantons. The only thing that these cans, all those have in common are a constitution, foreign policy and the currency. Aside from that, if they are totally different from one another, let's look at an example. Let's say you make a salary of 6,000 Swiss franc spend. You live in the region, all the Jura. In that case, you're going to pay income tax of 14% but if you made the same amounts of money and you live in the region of Zuellig, your income tax is only going to be 4% look at a different example. If you have a shop in Geneva, then you're going to have to close your shop at 6:00 PM but if you own a shop in Zurich, you're free to keep your shop open for as many hours as you want. Because of this system that comes on is can adjust the laws, the peculiarities of each individual territory ans what is even more important than this is that they can compete with each other.

Speaker 1:          02:31          This

Speaker 2:          02:31          explains why in general, the councils have assumption, no taxation, but our story doesn't end here. Switzerland is so decentralized that they have four official languages, German, French, Italian, and relaunch. This means that if you happen to go to Geneva, which is a French speaking part, you're not getting to hear anyone speaking German, the billboards, the road signs, the local newspapers, everything is in French. The same goes for Zurich with Jen and all the Ghana with Italian

Speaker 1:          03:02          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          03:05          Number two, Switzerland has no precedent. Every country has a head of governments who is responsible for certain things, right? Well, no, not switzer matters, but don't get me wrong, they're not living in anarchy or anything. This is what they do. Is they vote for a federal parliaments, which is similar to Congress in the United States of America. This parliaments and then chooses seven people who are going to become something like ministers or secretaries. All of these people have the same amount of

Speaker 1:          03:34          power.

Speaker 2:          03:38          Yeah. One of them takes a turn becoming Switzerland's international representative. It's technically this person is the president of Switzerland, but they haven't no specific powers. Uber, the other six people and as I said, they routine this person. Yeah. This is an important difference in the Swiss mentality because in other countries the president isn't really powerful. Passive bought in Switzerland. It's just a symbolic thing because all of the decision making is done by a team

Speaker 1:          04:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:08          or three direct democracy. This is the most important part of Swiss politics. They're referendums. In fact, most of it, that law was a chosen by a popular vote. Some at the federal level, some of the canned tonia level. The proposal for a referendum only requires 50,000 signatures. While one if it's going to amend the constitution requires 100 thousands now, don't get me wrong. Other countries do allow their populations to have referendums. For example, in Spain, this is totally possible, but a referendum proposal requires 500,000 signatures and they can't do any referendums that will change the culture

Speaker 1:          04:42          tuition because of this

Speaker 2:          04:45          system. Switzerland's holds several referendums every single year, every four months this waste go to the polling station and they will vote on any proposals that have been put forward in the previous four months. Now, let's look at an example of one of these referendums from the year 2015 if they have to choose whether they wanted to create a basic income for every Swiss citizen. They said no. By the way, they also had to decide on some amendments to the assisted reproduction acts and they also about to vote on some doors related to public transport. Interestingly, these, yeah, Paul's awesome having really big turnout. 60% of Swiss people for this 2015 referendum when to the polls

Speaker 1:          05:25          [inaudible] some number

Speaker 2:          05:27          for free markets. Some of you might think that it's very easy for a populist anticapitalist leader to emerge in a system like this, but make no mistake Switzerland is to the free markets like France is to it's wine. Don't forget, this country is isolated in the mountains and has practically no farming land. This means that it's have to sign a free trade agreements with pretty much every country on it. Well, it's hold on my deal. Libertarian friends who are watching this video, hold on for just second. Yes, it is true that Switzerland is a commerce loving nation. No more so than the European Union.

Speaker 1:          06:05          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          06:08          This is the Swiss actually subsidize that agriculture as much as the Europeans or the Americans do and they also participate in the same trade embargoes that exist with Iran and Russia. The only differences that Switzerland has embraced free trade since 1874 while the rest of the world's is only been doing it for the last few decades and now there is another very important difference about Switzerland, but we must get into, and it's probably one that you've heard about recent number five Swiss, no tragedy. Switzerland is one of the few neutral countries in the world. This means that they won't participate in any arms conflict. They even stayed out of world water you despite the fact that most of the population was against Hitler. Thanks to this, Switzerland has never been reconstructed while the rest of Europe ripped itself apart, killing millions and then spending billions in reconstruction. Switzerland didn't and they used all of those savings to improve that system. As we all know, the number one enemy of economic progress is

Speaker 2:          07:15          Switzerland does have a military. The thing is this army is entirely defensive and they will only use it to propel external attacks. They will never use it to find it in anything outside of self defense, and this is where we see one of the few drawbacks of the Swiss system. They're military or should we say them initia every Swiss citizen must do military service from the age of 18 to the age of 30 spending one month every single year serving in the military and even after that service period they miss still keep a gun at home. Of course it Switzerland's isn't the only country that does this with Norway and Israel. Also having mandatory military sentence.

Speaker 2:          07:57          People argue that this system is good with pundits saying that it creates more entrepreneurs and creates less income disparity. Don't forget that during that time in the military, the rich and the poor on mixing together several startups and companies have been created from relationships that were formed while people were serving in the military. But the big question is what about liberty? What about the freedom to choose? What gives the government the right to force you to work in a place that you might not want to work? Of course we don't have the answers to these questions, but they are just something for you to ponder.

Speaker 1:          08:29          Yeah. Number

Speaker 2:          08:32          six, ease of doing business. Finally, inventing is perhaps the most well known to thing about Switzerland am's. That is that taxes. It's true despite the differences from one council to another, Switzerland does typically have very low taxation. Further the laws to start a company. I'll a fairly simple and anyone can see those laws buying. Just giving online. Switzerland is one of the most transparent freeze in the world. This is encouraged a lots of international companies to establish their fiscal residents in Switzerland, but it also makes it very easy for people in Switzerland to set up their company and yes. Okay, okay. Banks do make up a large part of the Swiss economy, but it's probably not as big as you.

Speaker 1:          09:14          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:15          Oh, many, many other industries in Switzerland. It doesn't mean logitech mean anything to you. Well, look at your mouse. Look at your Webcam. You'll probably see it printed on one of those things. And this is a company that was formed in Switzerland and then there's the pharmaceuticals to the names, Novartis or Hoffman Laroche Ring. Any bells? Not to mention, of course, tourism, precision machinery. I'm that famous swaptions. I'm pretty sure you could mean five companies that are from Switzerland are simply buying meanings and expensive watch brands.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Ooh.

Speaker 2:          09:46          This is being done in a country with a population that is smaller than New York City. As we always say, visual politic. It is not a country's natural resources and it is not luck. The determine whether they are successful. It's their system of government and the institutions that do this. And we believe that the Swiss have a lot to teach the rest of the world in this regard.

Speaker 2:          10:09          Just our opinion. Do you agree with us? Do you disagree with us at? Do you think that your country could benefit from a system more in length, the Swiss?
