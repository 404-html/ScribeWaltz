Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:08          have you ever asked yourself, which is the best countries live in? Well, when we want to know which country that is, we usually tend to look at the country's GDP, but however important and relevant this indicator might be, it does have certain limitations. See this statistic is too wide and it can hide the influence of bubbles, the actions of dishonest politicians and is more complex issues like accounting for the online economy. It is true though that wealth and comfort are closely related to the GDP, but it is not an exact correlation. Let me explain. We could be analyzing a country that has a higher GDP per capita than another, but the last occurs have a better welfare system despite having that lower GDP and there are also other factors to consider that not strictly economic but also affects the social wellbeing of people of such as security and freedom. All right. All right, so probably know something you thinking right now and that's that. Well do these things or result from having a higher GDP anyway? Well, yeah, they kind of do, but it usually takes awhile before any of this can be seen in terms of numbers and statistics. For instance, if you look at Kuwait GDP per capita, it's definitely higher than Germany's. If given the choice, most people would probably rather live in the latter.

Speaker 2:          01:19          It's also more likely that Germany is going to be involved in complex and high added value activities like creating patents and innovative companies. In other words, [inaudible] it might become richer, but at the same time Germany might be taking better advantage of its wealth in order to produce welfare, sustainable wealth, technology and knowledge and most people would regard doing that as a pretty sensible decision and this whole complicated thing. That's why they're on new indicators to try to make a more accurate approximation so that we can work out the prosperity and comforts of different nations. One of them is the famous [inaudible] gotten prosperity index. National success is about far more than just GDP. It is about a healthy and happy life, a good education for our children, a clean and protected environment, family and communities. We can rely on a safe place to live up to unity's, to start a business or get ahead and the freedom to be who we want to be. This is true prosperity. And you know what's, at least according to these rankings, the most prosperous nation on earth is, well, that would be New Zealand's most prosperous country.

Speaker 1:          02:26          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Trying to get a deeper knowledge of the prosperity of the country beyond the GDP. The GOSSAN prosperity index considers tons of different factors, economics, business, civil liberties, government education environments. Honestly, every aspects that accounts for quality of life in a country. So in the latest ranking, the results, it was pretty clear. Nowadays, New Zealand's the land of the Kiwi is the most prosperous country on the planet as honestly, this wasn't really much of a surprise. And He Zealand's has taken this position six times in the last 10 years. Not Bad. Right.

Speaker 2:          03:01          And now you might be wondering, which are the countries New Zealand is competing with in order to win the crown of the best country on earth. Well, you wouldn't be surprised to find at the top of the list countries like Norway, Finland, Switzerland, Canada or Australia, it's pretty tough competition. I should also mention at this point that soon enough we're going to be explaining on this channel how New Zealand achieved so much of this after so much crisis. If you want to catch that video, be sure to subscribe to this channel, but for now, let's move on. Now, if you think New Zealand is just ranks number one for this indicator, well you couldn't be more wrong if we consider the doing business ranking. For instance, this is a ranking by the way, that classifies countries according to how easy it is to set up a company and do business.

Speaker 2:          03:40          We can see that New Zealand is also in the number one spot in the latest ranking New Zealand dethrone Singapore as easiest place to do business. If we use the index of economic freedom from the Heritage Foundation, we will see that New Zealand is in third position right after a Singapore and Hong Kong. Then if we use the ranking of the Fraser Institute, a ranking that considers both economic and civil freedoms. New Zealand's is also in the top three just behind Hong Kong and Switzerlands and if this is not enough for you as you want more specific information, I can also tell you that New Zealand is the least corrupt country on earth according to Transparency International. This is a position that it shares with Denmark. Yes. Unlike other countries that we happen to know very well, it is very uncommon for this country's government to have their hands in the till. Furthermore, this is also one of the safest countries in the wells as well as being one of the most environmentally friendly and it also has the all blacks, the best national rugby team on the planet.

Speaker 3:          04:39          Oh,

Speaker 2:          04:40          but let's move on from the rankings because honestly we could go on forever. They do seem to make one thing clear though, and that is that on paper New Zealand, it sure does look like one of the best places in the world to live.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:53          By the way. Here is a surprising fact about alto. Rob, as it said in Maori, which is an official language that the New Zealand is a really proud of the Maori culture and it's the integration of these Polynesian people that the British pounds when they arrived on these islands, it is true no matter where you go, the Maori culture is present.

Speaker 1:          05:10          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:12          All right, so moving on, on the 23rd of September, 2017 elections took place in this country.

Speaker 1:          05:21          Okay,

Speaker 2:          05:22          a record election.

Speaker 2:          05:25          The first thing we need to remember is that New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy. That's right, Elizabeth. The second is still the queen of this country, but it's really just a symbolic position. God Save the Queen in New Zealand, the government is elected by the parliaments and the term it lasts for three years. Further, when New Zealand is go to vote, they have to vote twice. One of the votes goes to a single candidates from one political party. This will complete eight parts of the parliaments. The other vote goes to an NP who will represent their districts. So as we sat on the 23rd of September, New Zealand's a held an election and it was a clear for the National Party of Bill English.

Speaker 2:          06:06          Bill English already was the prime minister by the way, since the resignation of Junky in December of 2016 we also going to talk about this former prime minister in an upcoming video. So again, please do hit that subscribe button. So this victory for the national posse, well it was historic in a way, and this was for two reasons. First because this party had never got so many votes in an election and seconds because if the new government is confirmed for the National Party would have been in power since 2008 for the longest period in office for a party in New Zealand for more than 50 years. And truth be told, there are plenty of reasons why bill English one as we have seen, the country is in great shape. In fact, it is going through one of the best moments in its history. The economy is growing, unemployment is higher than the average and the unemployment is pretty scarce. Plus they also have healthy public finances.

Speaker 2:          06:55          Mr. English is eight years. His finance minister, unemployment fell. The budget return to a surplus and New Zealand enjoyed one of the highest growth rates in the developed world. The National Party's intention is to continue with the politics that they've carried out since 2008 and that's more trade balanced budgets and also trying to keep immigration rates higher than ever. This has actually been a very important aspect of their political campaign. I mean, if it's not broken, don't fix it. 181,000 jobs have been created in the last two years and the average annual wage is up $13,000 under national. Someone working on the minimum wage has seen their annual income go up $8,000 since 2008 Bill English. Despite this, all the campaign hasn't been as comfortable as some expected. After all, even in the most prosperous country, there are challenges and unresolved issues. Mamia and challenges

Speaker 2:          07:50          just into done was elected leader of the Labour Party policy. It wasn't exactly going through its best moments. In the elections of 2014 the Labour party barely gone to 25% of the vote, about half the votes of Junkies National Party. However, shortly after they choose a new leader who was only 37 years old. Well, things that things started to change, the press, they call this just sinned. A mania. Two things have been the keys of Jacinta's campaign housing and immigration. You see one of the problems in New Zealand is the price of houses. Something that has skyrocketed in the last few years. The price of housing has increased much more than in Australia or Canada or the United States. New Zealand to tops world house price increase, but why is the price of housing growing quite so much? Well, that's for several reasons, but there are three main causes. First, economy and salaries are increasing a lot in New Zealand. Second's immigration rates are higher than ever. This is one of the countries that receives the most immigrants every year relative to their population and it's more immigrants. That means the greater demand.

Speaker 1:          08:49          How's it?

Speaker 2:          08:54          Because many millionaires investors, especially from Asia but also from other parts of the world. Once a buy houses here to put their money in a safe place and also to enjoy the country. One example of these people would be Jack Mar, the CEO of Alibaba does the National Party. They wanted to tackle this issue by making construction easy and fast. The Labor Party have just Endura done came up with two suggestions. First, reducing the number of immigrants by half and second is preventing foreign investors from buying houses in New Zealand. It was this speech on Housing and immigration that got him the support of the Party and Poles. It seemed to indicate that at times it was a very close race, but once the election's arrived, the Kiwis, well they did not hesitate.

Speaker 1:          09:39          Okay,

Speaker 2:          09:39          let's be clear. New Zealand, it's a great country, but it does have some obstacles to overcome housing and proving Mallory integration and technical education are a few of these things, but in the grand scheme of things, they're pretty small problems. Now we're going to discuss some of these problems in a future video, but for now, New Zealanders, they can enjoy some of the best living standards in the wells anyway. Now it's your turn.
