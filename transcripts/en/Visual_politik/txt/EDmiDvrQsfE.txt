Speaker 1:          00:07          I've got a question for you. What would happen if Ronald Reagan came back to life and met Donald Trump in the oval office? Do you think they'd become friends? Do you think that shake hands and find common grounds with similar values and political beliefs? Of course, both are considered diehard conservatives both aren't considered a boogie man for liberals and both had a career in show business, but in fact, this is where the similarities. Ronald Reagan's job as president was to find the worst recession since the great depression and to do so. He promised the Reagan Revolution, the so called revolution, focusing on reducing government spending taxes as well as regulation

Speaker 2:          00:51          government, not government.

Speaker 1:          00:57          President Reagan likes the free markets and believe that capitalism would solve the nation's problems. They also like to portray himself as a humble paternal figure. In other words, he prided himself on being a man of high moral values

Speaker 2:          01:10          would be unmistakable. Open this gate,

Speaker 1:          01:15          trump however, is a totally different animal. He shows off his fortune, his former model trophy wife, and he is so obviously the opposite of a paternal figure. He's more like that weird uncle living like a bachelor regardless of his age and guessing, embarrassingly drunk during family reunions.

Speaker 3:          01:43          Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:46          On the policy side, trump is seldom friendly toward the free market and smaller government. He loves debt. The idea of trade wars and his protectionist policy have taken care of. America seems to be at odds with the gips tendency to be in favor, at least in theory of the free market. As you can probably see, there is a clash that runs deep in the soul of the Republican Party, or at least this is how it looks from an outside perspective. On the one hand, there's this, the good old party, but loves America. Small government, low taxes and conservative values, and then there is this other Republican party that loves trophy wives, big beautiful walls and terrorists and who's winning? Well, you guessed it. There was a wave of Republicans leaving Congress among all of these differences in values and policy. The new cycle has been completely taken over by a new wave of Republicans and she was the most important of them all. Well, I would actually be pulled up Ryan, the speaker of the House and the Republicans, golden boy for years for Ron, the champion of fiscal rectitude and smaller government, and now he's announced that he's not going to run for reelection, and as you can imagine, he's not the only one. Many republicans might be living, but there are always new elections and therefore new candidates, but also ones with questionable characters. Take for example, the Alabama special elections held back in December of 2017,

Speaker 4:          03:23          back candidate Roy Moore was buried under tons of allegations of sexual abuse of minors. For these scandals, Republicans lost the seat in Alabama for the first time in decades, but the biggest surprise is that a republican president supported and alleged sexual predator. Could you imagine something like this just five years ago as you could expect, this Alabama scandal appeared on all the national newspapers and hit the White House,

Speaker 1:          03:58          and now you might wonder, well, what did Donald trump do to solve this pr crisis? Well, they did absolutely nothing. Nothing at all. And this is one of the reasons why so many Republican candidates are doing so badly in the polls, even in traditionally red states. But what does this mean for the White House? Well, for those who don't keep up with American politics so much this year, the country had legislative elections, these other so called midterms.

Speaker 1:          04:29          This is when members of Congress and many senators and relax it in America, the president, and that is the executive power is voted in during one election, in the legislative power during another. This is why, for example, despite Obama being Democrats, the majority of the legislative chambers were Republican, and if the Republicans lose too many seats during the 2018 midterms, trump is going to be in dire straits anytime he wants to pass a bill. That the real question now is, how did the Republican Party gassier can a political party change their ideology this quickly? Well, today we're going to answer these questions, but before we do, let's take a look back at the history. Reagan revolution. Ronald Reagan started out as a registered Democrats and a new deal support, but he left the party in 1962 crossing over to the gop stating that he didn't leave the Democratic Party, but it was the party that left him. Nevertheless, things in the gop were not ideal either. According to Reagan, Republicans had bought into most of the values of the Democratic Party and despite the passionate rhetoric, than once some truth to that. Have you ever heard of cultural hegemony? This is a concept Marxist philosophers like to use a lot. According to them, the ruling class needs to create a consensus, a set of moral values that are shared by the majority of the political players, including the opposition party.

Speaker 1:          06:02          Back then idea is like the welfare state and the need for more governmental control of the economy that came the new mainstream, even the republican side, to accept those principles if they wanted to be considered a serious power. This explains why both Nixon and Eisenhower did very little when it comes to economics and you guys did. Reagan was not a big fan of this.

Speaker 5:          06:23          No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income today. Thirty seven cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collectors share.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Here comes the interesting pos. Cultural hegemony is something that changes over time. How well when those values are no longer solving people's problems. This is what happens in the 19 seventies with the energy crisis. America was really not in a good place back then and this was the window of opportunity that Ronald Reagan needed to reinvents the Republican Party and create the ideological platform we used to know as conservatism. In other words, he took something old and made it shiny again by more or less creating a brands new ideology.

Speaker 1:          07:09          The question is, well, how do you do that? How can you create a brand new ideology that makes sense and lets you win elections? Well, let me introduce you to the theory of the empty signifier. Basically, Ronald Reagan went to all the political groups that fell outside of the political mainstream at the time he spoke to the evangelical conservative. So one, you spoke to the military industrial complex guys for another, and finally he spoke to everybody who was tired of paying so many taxes. Then he merged all of these groups into one common cause, liberty and freedom. This is what we call an empty signifier. It's a concept so vague that everybody can project onto the vagueness, the meaning that they're looking for. For a fiscal conservative, freedom means being free from paying so many taxes for a whole kitchen. Conservative freedom means fighting or authoritarian rulers.

Speaker 5:          08:00          In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem,

Speaker 1:          08:08          but think about it. How is it possible to have people so different from one another on the same platform? It's a big time contradictions. I have someone who wants small government and someone else who wants to increase military spending. Right? Well, if you want to create a political identity, you need an antagonist. And Ronald Reagan, he couldn't have had it easier. Open this gate, Mr Gorbachev, tear down this.

Speaker 2:          08:37          Whoa. Yup, Yup.

Speaker 1:          08:42          He picked the evil communists. This is why during the 1980 [inaudible] there were so many movies where the communists were the bad guys. Yeah, you have talked to us like Red Dawn, rocky four, and of course, top gun. All of these movies, along with Reagan's speeches, helps create a brand new cultural, hegemonic, even democratic presidents like crimson to promise tax cuts in order to win an election.

Speaker 3:          09:02          Yes,

Speaker 1:          09:07          but as you know, the Soviet Union fell in the nineties. So what happens when you lose your antagonist? Well, you simply find another one like President Reagan did two decades before President Bush operated from a Christian worldview that distinguishes between good and evil. After the tragedy of September, the 11th presidents Bush announced that the battle ahead would be a monumental struggle of good versus evil. The good will prevail, and that's how these so called evil became America's new enemy.

Speaker 6:          09:38          We will rally the world to this caused by our efforts, by our courage. We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail,

Speaker 3:          09:50          of course.

Speaker 1:          09:50          So I'm not saying that terrorists are communists and all evil or that they are just some sort of fabricated monster. Of course not, but they can be utilized to create a political platform. Every important politician, they've done it. Roosevelt did it, Reagan did it, Bush did it. But what happens when you run out of enemies? What happens when the Soviet Union is no more? Or when bin Laden is debt? Well, this is the time for,

Speaker 3:          10:16          oh,

Speaker 1:          10:20          but trump revolution after the 2008 financial crisis, the economic mainstream, the cultural hegemony was once again a challenge resulting in people not trusting the economic mainstream anymore.

Speaker 6:          10:32          The word didn't spread through mainstream media and immediately the question arose whether or not the lack of coverage was because it wasn't newsworthy or because some of the people being protested against have the control over the various mainstream media outlets on September 30th. We took a trip into the city to see what

Speaker 1:          10:48          it wasn't being talked about. When people lose faith in something that's usually leaves a void that needs to be filled by a new kind of discourse and here sweeps in Canada. Did Donald J dot trump with his inflammatory speeches during campaign rallies all his personal scandals and is scorching and polarizing public statements once again, a new presidential candidate managed to align himself with an astounding variety of political and religious groups that felt misrepresented by the mainstream.

Speaker 1:          11:21          In fact, 80 percent of evangelical Christians voted for trump much more than any other religious Greek evangelical Christian values are about family and moral integrity. So why is a guy like trump with all his divorces and sexual scandals not perceived as immoral by them? Well, even in the light of the recent media storm surrounding the alleged cash payment, do you silence Pornstar? Stormy Daniels? Seventy eight percent of evangelical voters still support trump as army evangelical leaders went as far as publicly stating they have given the president's what they called a Mulligan. A do over. I bought a gun, is a golf metaphor, which is strangely appropriate. It's considering trumps passion for that sport.

Speaker 4:          12:06          Yes, evangelical conservatives gave him a Mulligan. They let them have a do over. They said, we will start fresh with you and give you a second chance. Tony Perkins, speaking at CNN,

Speaker 1:          12:16          so how is this possible? Well, as you might've guessed, the antagonists come into play, so who or what is trump's political enemy? The first group that immediately comes to mind is the mainstream media, or as the American president calls them the fake news media. The second enemy is the so called swamp. A term that refers to the not so clean and not so transparent political scene in Washington. The third have many more enemies is you guessed it, immigrants, so trump can always play the me or the others card and it seems to work for him. So what do all these talking points have in common? Well, that's the outright has been using them for years. Trump managed to appeal to evangelicals and members of the foreign rights that for a long time it felt misinterpreted by the liberal and mainstream media and trump's rhetoric on migration also driven the support of the extreme far right. Sometimes the Neo Nazi rally in Charlottesville. It wasn't later condemned by the president. He went so far as to say that the were very fine. People on both sides

Speaker 7:          13:22          from Mexico.

Speaker 4:          13:23          Can us too bad on the trump campaign in two moments.

Speaker 1:          13:27          Trump's rhetoric has also spawned a lot of Republican candidates. This are trying to appeal to the same voters that are at the core base of the presidents going so far as to state that they are trumpea than trump, but does it actually work, but apparently it works pretty well for those bearing the trump name. Take, for example, the West Virginia Republican primary, one of the candidates came up with an ad that was filled to the brim with trump's preferred phrases, the idioms, and yet still he came up last in the race

Speaker 8:          13:55          swap. Captain Mitch Mcconnell has created millions of jobs for China people while doing so. Mitch has gotten rid of. In fact, there's China. Family has given him tens of millions of dollars. Micha swamp people are now running false negative ads against me

Speaker 1:          14:08          in order to give you a fuller accounts of the trump presidency would kind of need a few days. In the meantime, considering all this controversy well, how other Republicans doing, many political analysts believe that the democratic blue wave and they crash onto these midterm elections, but is it only a reaction to trump scandals or the democratic inclined voters more energized?

Speaker 4:          14:39          Republicans are losing 2018 midterm money wars

Speaker 1:          14:42          as reported by CNN. The GOP is worried about these incoming midterm elections. In that piece, CNN reported that senior members of the party are wanting the younger members to accumulate as many donations as possible in order to be able to successfully run campaigns in a difficult political culture. Suffice it to say that in the is most competitive house races, 40 Republicans have been outraged by that democratic challenges with our speaker, Paul Ryan's abrupt access to the Republican corporate donor base was a bit shaken, a number of party donors and operatives believed that the speaker's acts. It was the final piece of evidence that they needed to flip their attention from the house to the Senate, and that means empty house wallets for House Republicans, which will pretty much be left to fend for themselves.

Speaker 2:          15:29          But

Speaker 1:          15:30          we need to remember that when it comes to politics, nothing is written in stone. We have visual politic. We're going to be keeping a close eye on these upcoming midterms, but as always, you do need to run another. When it comes to politics, nothing's written in stone. We have visual politic. We're getting to pay special attention to these upcoming midterms. So now it's your turn. All the Republicans losing their credibility. Do you think that they're going to lose votes?
