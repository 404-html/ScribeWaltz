Speaker 1:          00:00          Ostentatious exaggerated, colossal big themes that Dubai always aspires to carry out, the largest, most luxurious and most eccentric projects in the world. Small territory we can find the tallest building, the most luxurious hotel hands. Even the largest international airport on the planet's located in a strategic enclave at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The growth process of Dubai is one of the fastest in human history. It just over 20 years. It has gone from being a remote and last enclave in the desert to becoming one of the world's great capitals. In this period of time, the Emirates of Dubai has multiplied by four. It's population by nine, the number of visitors and buying eight the size of its economy. You said that. The question is how has all of this development been achieved? Has it all just been a matter of oil? Well, in this visual politic video, we're going to talk all about Dubai. Do you believe is one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates? We could describe it as governments as an Islamic autocracy that restricts the launch part of people's civil liberties. However, if we compare it with neighboring countries, do Boeing, is volume follow the most open place in the Middle East East?

Speaker 1:          01:26          How about some examples? Well, here women can drive. The van is not mandatory. You can buy pork at the supermarket and even alcohol is not hard to come.

Speaker 2:          01:39          Yes,

Speaker 1:          01:40          things are starting to change in a way. I think we could refer to this city as a kind of oasis in the middle of the desert and as you can imagine, all of this change has had its rewards and well these rewards, they might just surprise you. Did you know that to Bonnie is already the fourth most visited city in the world when it comes to international visitors and that it surpasses epicenters of tourism and as global trade such as New York, Hong Kong or Singapore? It absolutely is and this is something that does surprise a lot of people. Of course, there's one thing we have to be clear on here, do buy. It does not aspire to be the freest place on earth, but they do want to become the richest was of opulence in this place. Also evidence that it's not strange to see the Dubai police patrolling the streets in Ferrari's on Lamborghini.

Speaker 2:          02:35          Where else

Speaker 1:          02:35          in the world could you possibly see something like this, so you might at this moment would be thinking, well, there's an easy explanation for all of this, and that is of course oil. Now, could it be that Dubai is nothing more than a dream method is financed with petro dollars? Well, although we cannot deny the influence of black goals here, the truth is that the real key to success is very different. The secret to Dubai is not oil, but rather its commitment to trade. Don't believe me. Well, let's dive in a little deeper.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:10          enough oil. The ends of the 19 fifties, important oil deposits were discovered in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi. The capital of the Emirates.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Take note it because we're not talking about some small discovery, but an absolutely huge amounts of oil. To give you an idea, it is estimated that the wealth of the Emirates, they're proven reserves is even greater than all the reserves in Russia. However, in the case of Dubai, things that were a little bit different, it is true that this territory was also graced with the 14 of black goals, but it's authorities soon realize that their reserves were much smaller than those of their compatriots in Abu Dhabi. In fact, the only surprise us oil today accounts for less than one in every $100 produced by Dubai's economy. So you've probably heard about how important it is. Do you diversify it and economy rice? Well, that is precisely what Dubai did. They overcame their dependence and their addiction to wild. Now, this is all very easy to say, but the question is, well, how did they do it? What did you do to achieve such developments can achieve a higher standard of living even compared to its oil rich natives.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Well, basically what it did was attract a whole bunch of multinationals and professionals from all around the world to achieve this. The first thing they did was only low tax policy in Dubai. They have no income tax. The tax on profits, it's practically nonexistent concurrently. Purchases and not taxed either or the. The latter is about to change as the result of a joint agreement between all members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council. Tax on purchases will soon be launched, however, the rate is only going to be about five percent, which is significantly lower than the rates we see in developed countries which tend to be around 18 percent.

Speaker 1:          05:02          Of course in case you were wondering in Dubai that are no taxes on gasoline. Yes, I know it almost seems like we're talking about another planet, rice, but do not think that low taxes are the only strategy that Dubai has follows not at all in fact, seconds and perhaps even more important than taxes. You buying his resorted to an instrument known as a special economic zones like here, they are somewhat different to the ones we can find elsewhere in the wells and do these special areas in addition to having tax benefits, even have their own regulations almost lost, which as you can imagine, are always focused on promoting business activity precisely thanks to you having specific rules. Companies can escape the rigidity of legal systems that are inspired by Sharia law applies. Of course, to the rest of the Emirates,

Speaker 1:          05:52          we can find a good example of this model in these so called Dubai international financial, which is almost a states within another state look, this financial center, it even has its own judicial system, Chad, by the way, by a British judge and it even has its own official language which is not Arabic but English and it's also replaced the local currency with the US dollar. In this way, a financial institution. The bank, for example, can do business as if it was in Manhattan, are benefiting from the tax advantages of Dubai. A lot of our deals

Speaker 2:          06:23          right?

Speaker 1:          06:26          Well now we can probably understand how Dubai has managed to attract most of the 25 largest banks in the world, but this is not all along with the low taxes and special economic zones. Dubai has also opted for a very high degree of immigration freedom and the result of all this, well, 96 percent of its inhabitants, they've been born a boy. Wait a second, because there is still more now to further boost foreign investments. At the beginning of this century, the Dubai authorities made an unprecedented decision for this corner of the world,

Speaker 2:          07:04          right?

Speaker 1:          07:05          Being bold. Governments of Dubai approved a risky decree that's announced any foreigner regardless of their religion, to make real estate investments at that moment, the authentic, but it really began. I was full of buildings and large projects, hundreds of skyscrapers, gigantic shopping centers, even it's famous artificial islands. Now the demand for Dubai became absolutely global. It's the fact that since 2002 Dubai has experienced real estate developments comparable only to that of Shanghai City with 13 times more

Speaker 2:          07:48          indeed,

Speaker 1:          07:49          one of the most surprising things about Dubai is that it has a population of less than 3 million inhabitants just like this, where before there were only a handful of skyscrapers. Thanks to this decree that are now hundreds and huge projects are announced, one after the other. B, this new skyscrapers, ferris wheels, theme parks, whatever. One of these latest projects, by the way, is known as the mall of the wealth. It's a gigantic space designed to become the largest shopping center in the world hands, which will even has its own cultural districts with dozens of theaters and cinemas. 100 hotels, the largest indoor theme park in the world. The project has been presented as the world's first city with a temperature controlled environment.

Speaker 2:          08:37          All

Speaker 1:          08:38          of these measures have made Dubai a place where it is easy to do business until he turns. This mrs into a commercial, touristic financial, logistical, and Steven industrial power. Yes. Anyone who thinks that all Dubai, Isabel is banks and hotels is very, very wrong nowadays. Dubai largely thanks to its modern ports and special zones is the third largest exporting power in the world ends. It's industrial production exceeds $50,000,000,000. Every single.

Speaker 2:          09:05          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:11          Is what explains why its neighbors are on easily watching any fall in the price of oil. While the government of Dubai continues to carry out and large projects. It is true from a strictly political points of view that there aren't many reprehensible elements when it comes to religious, social or human rights issues. For example, that all the painful conditions suffered by many construction workers from countries such as India, Bangladesh, or Pakistan. Now, of course we cannot ignore this reality, but we cannot not pay attention to the achievements of this emeris among other things, because of this growth, divine has managed to influence the policies of its neighbors and they are beginning to reduce their dependence on oil as well. Dubai is quite simply a great model.

Speaker 2:          09:49          Consider it,

Speaker 1:          09:52          for example, the new Saudi Arabia onto Mohammed bin Salman. This is something we actually spoke about in a previous video. Anyway, I think this case puts a very important question on the table. Is it possible to reconcile the absence of civil rights with sustainable economic growth? Overtime? No history and empirical evidence seems to show that this is not the case, but in a world increasingly pressured by very high taxes and regulations of all kinds, Dubai's authorities seem intent on demonstrating that this time it will be possible at the moment. Spitz commitment to free trade and investments and its policies aimed at strengthening legal security, ease of doing business and keeping taxes low have been supportive. If anything, do you buy shoes? It's the competitiveness and trade tend to have better results in terms of developments than protectionism or subsidies. Many rules should pay attention to the successes of this oasis in the desert, but that's our opinion here, visual politic, and now we'd love to know what you think.
