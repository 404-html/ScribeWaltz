Speaker 1:          00:00          There's a country that always, always, always, always appears in the headlines of international newspapers, and it's for two main reasons why one of them soccer and the other is economic crisis. The problem, my friends lately, these headlines on having more to do with crises on the football, I am of course talking about Argentina.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25          It's hard to say, but Argentina is a country that is as allergic to reforms as it is addicted to crises. When everything seemed to be going well, 2018 suddenly became very, very complicated. So much so that we're ECO Macra, he's governments has been forced to to ask for a bailout from the international monetary funds. So now you might be thinking really a bailout Argentina again. Well, yes, you heard it right. Argentina, the country of tango is back on the ropes, so listen up.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03          April and May of 2018 haven't exactly been great months for Argentina.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:20          That condition and [inaudible]. [inaudible] [inaudible]. That's who we ended up. Sandy [inaudible] are the basis the American, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:33          thanks.

Speaker 1:          01:35          And just a few weeks of pay. So it was depreciated by 20% going from an exchange rate of one US dollar for 20 pesos to an exchange rate of $1 getting you 25 pesos. You know what? There's not exactly surprising since the beginning of 2018 Argentina's currency has depreciated by at 25% and if we extended that time frame to five years, could you guess how much the peso has depreciated since then? Well, the reality is that it's been an absolutely brutal 80% appreciation. Make no mistake as though the plummeting exchange rate isn't the problem. It's the consequence

Speaker 2:          02:27          you see,

Speaker 1:          02:28          you Argentina's real problem lies in its addiction to public spending. And I'm not saying the public spending is slightly higher than they can afford here after they have such high public spending that Argentina simply has no ability to afford it.

Speaker 2:          02:44          Okay?

Speaker 4:          02:44          In the last 57 years, we spent 53 years with the state spending more than it collects. That is with the fiscal deficits. And during those 53 years, we had four huge crises. Now we're fighting to avoid a fifth one, Jose Luis, Bert and Argentine

Speaker 1:          03:00          economist. But I know what you might be thinking right now. You're probably thinking, Simon, what the hell does public spending have to do with the pcs depreciation? Well, actually much more than you'd think. So let's go through it step by step.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Argentina is facing eight triple time bomb. It has a huge external deficits, a huge public deficits, and $250 billion of external desk. Of course, as you can imagine, both the deficits and the dads have to be paid. Here's where that first big problem appears. He is, and he is a protectionism, devaluations, hyper regulation, and very high taxes. Indeed, Argentina is one of the countries with the highest business taxes on the entire planet. Now, all of this has stopped. The industry ends, the Argentine economy in general, from being competitive. It's also caused capitalists. Do you flee the country long ago in such a refuge somewhere else? I mean, it's a little sounds pretty logical, right? And so what's the result of this? Well, since there's no money at home, Argentina has become very dependent on foreign financing. According to the Institute of International Finance, most almost 64% of Argentina's state and corporate debt is denominated in dollars and other foreign currency. That's why both the volume of central bank reserves and the exchange rate of very, very important. Yeah, of course, on the one hand, they need to pay for imports and deal with debt payments, but since Argentina has a negative external balance, that is, it consumes more dollars than it gets. It needs someone to lend them those dollars. It needs investors to bring money into the country

Speaker 1:          05:03          and my friends, if investors don't lend that money because they don't trust the country, then Argentina has a problem, a really big problem. On the other hands, if the peso depreciates, then obviously it loses value in folks. Let's be honest, nobody wants to have their savings in a currency that the is so cool.

Speaker 2:          05:20          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:30          sorry. Well, what do you do in that situation? Well, essentially what you do is you rush to exchange all of your pieces for a stronger and more stable currency and well, that's exactly what the population are doing and that is causing the currency to collapse. Even further, and of course that leaves two reserves being consumed even faster, but all right, having said that, let's take a look at that. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          05:57          See,

Speaker 1:          05:58          both Nesta catch now ran the specialty. Cristina Fernandez de Kartchner, the two previous presidents of Argentina, they like to spend quite freely. When they came to power in 2002 public spending was equivalent to 23% of GDP when they left, when it was more like 40% now you might be wondering, well, what did they do with all the money? Well, basically they hired public employees to win votes and multiplied subsidies.

Speaker 2:          06:25          No,

Speaker 1:          06:26          in only 13 years, public employment sought by 60% to give you an idea of how extreme this was today, 35% of employees in Argentina work for the government.

Speaker 6:          06:40          Hopefully they're gonna share this. [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible] select libido basis or Rochelle.

Speaker 2:          07:02          Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:03          get this in seven provinces in the country, there are more public workers, then there are private. It really is a crazy situation. It's given that the government didn't have enough money to pay for all of this year after year, they continue to register a huge public deficits. Now, as you might know, the coach and has couldn't go to the international markets first because they're investors didn't trust them in seconds because the country was already in the fall.

Speaker 2:          07:37          Okay.

Speaker 6:          07:38          He's wonderful. He, Naomi Luna, a [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:57          oh, nice.

Speaker 1:          08:01          Nine. Of course, if you don't pay your investors, obviously the investors don't lend you any more money. All right, so what do you think they did then? Yeah, they used every populist politicians favorite machine, the money printing machine. They simply printed new pesos to pay that public expenditure vasant and establishing your currency camp, which meant and limiting the amounts of money there's Argentinians could take out of the country. So they wouldn't be, Thomas said dwindling reserves. And the question is, what happens when these policies continue? Well, inflation, the soul is due to all the new stays in circulation and foreign investors of course do not want to come near you. And so there was in these circumstances that Mauricio Macri came to power

Speaker 5:          08:54          the mockery plants.

Speaker 1:          08:58          Mauricio Macri came to the Castle Rosado. He had a plan to implement reforms little by little that were commonly known as gradualism,

Speaker 3:          09:06          but eight to implement [inaudible] economic [inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          09:21          and the truth is they've actually been quite successful. The business climate has improved. Some subsidies have been reduced and in a way they regained the international investors trust out of all the hard things they needed to do if they've only done the easiest ones. What they haven't achieved in more than two years of governing has been decreasing the public deficits

Speaker 5:          09:45          flushing

Speaker 1:          09:49          in spite of having access to the financial markets, the options on government has continued to prince bills to maintain that public expenditure out of course means more inflation. This chart shows how the money is growing. That is how the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina continues to issue more and more pesos. Good. All right. Now you might be wondering, well, it wasn't Mauricio Macri that duty was supposed to change things. Well, Gary was, but slowly see this all has an explanation. Yeah. Factories team's idea was to carry out reforms and little by little to attract investments and make the Argentine economy grow. If the economy grew, the government would raise more money and would not have to make cuts. Meanwhile, little by little, as they regains the international markets trust, they would be able to issue a debt and is thus reduce the need to print bills in this way. Within a few years, Argentina would you got rid of that deficits, limit inflation and would start to grow again. It's an accurate, of course would maintainers political capital to continue winning elections. It all sounds like a pretty great plant rice. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          11:09          Well,

Speaker 1:          11:11          so far things have actually kind of gone his plans, but just hold on a moment because things have now changed and it's mainly for two reasons. Fast. After two and a half years in power, it's hard to understand how the public deficits, inflation and taxes continue to skyrocket. Gradualism how's it become something like racing and arthritic at all and seconds because the Federal Reserve of the United States has begun to raise interest rates C for public debt in the United States, the 10 year bond is already yielding 3%

Speaker 5:          11:49          okay.

Speaker 1:          11:57          Out of course, many investors now asked themselves if the u s desk, which is supposedly the less risky assets, gives me a reasonable return. Why on earth would I keep lending money to Argentina? Wow, I see no changes.

Speaker 2:          12:12          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:13          well that's exactly what it is because many people who were interested in investing in Argentina to turn away from it, and for this reason, macaroons, governments has decided to resort to the international monetary funds to obtain a credit line with which to face the debt maturities of the upcoming months and the future. Can you remember what would happen if a new default occurred before the 2019 elections? You see, everything has to do with the government's behaviour and if you think about it for a moment, it's actually very sensible. The patients once held for Argentina, it's gone. What investors and Argentine savers find themselves saying is fine. If you want to spend more than you can go right ahead, but just don't do it with my money.

Speaker 2:          12:57          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:59          and this is north of me in regards of public spending, but many other reforms that make it easier to do business. And this, it brings up a key question. Is it time to abandon gradualism aggressive therapies or gradualism

Speaker 2:          13:20          nope.

Speaker 1:          13:21          Flakes making reforms is never an easy task, but I think it's time for the castle Rosado that's the Argentinian version of the White House to osc itself. A question shouldn't leave. Perhaps try employing more aggressive measures. Well, you know what? First let's take a look at the historical evidence. Which do you think has worked better? Gradualism a con step by step change or aggressive therapy?

Speaker 2:          13:41          Hey,

Speaker 1:          13:43          we can see a good example of huge transformations in the former countries of the Soviet orbit. When the communist model collapsed in 1989 many countries employed drastic changes almost overnight while others, obs, there's four more gradual measures. Now's the best results. It was the ones that made the most

Speaker 2:          14:04          good

Speaker 1:          14:06          trees, assumptions, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and the Czech Republic opposite for a more drastic change that is making reforms as quickly as possible. Yeah, it was pretty hot at the beginning, but soon they began to grow and they achieved all kinds of investments to such an extent that today these countries which were mostly poor in 1989 have a higher standard of living than Portugal or any Latin American country. On the other hand is though you see what plying gradual reforms, countries such as Ukraine, Romania, Tajikistan, ends, Armenia, well, let's just say things haven't gone so well either an economic or social tams. Anyway, if I x, this is a decision that macri is government has to make. It has to decide whether to take advantage of the IMF, some money to carry out strong reforms once and for all or continue with grand jury will listen it and let's be clear. If Argentina doesn't fix its public debt and stopped printing bills, the future does not look good.

Speaker 4:          15:10          Borrowing money is in good governance. Good governance is creating basic reforms. In Argentina. There's an elephant Tine, gigantic hypertrophied state that needs to be slimmed down. They need to cut public spending. Jame Bailey,

Speaker 1:          15:25          in addition, the model simply doesn't work. The Argentine government has never spent so much, and despite that it's been decades since there was so much poverty and so much violence. But we'll mastery listener. Well, I need the future will tell, but now it's your turn. What do you think? Should they continue with the gradual reforms or is it time for a faster change while leave your answer in the comments below as well as in this survey, and I know this was a bit of a dense subjects, but I hope with this video we were able to shed some light on us and I really have keep did enjoy the video.
