Speaker 1:          00:08          In recent decades, it has been normal to consider the tenants of the White House, the president of the United States has the most powerful person in the world give you a things they might be changing or maybe they've actually already changed. Have you heard about the Chinese presidents? Well, of course you have because I'm sure you're a very avid visual politic view app now. You see Donald Trump himself in statements collected by the Washington Post describes the Chinese president, Xi Jinping as the most powerful leader that China has had in the last century, which is as good as saying that Xi Jinping is the most powerful Chinese leader of all time.

Speaker 1:          00:56          More and more analysts wondering if he isn't in fact the most powerful political leader in the world. Yes, it's true now while trying is economy and its army are still on a second level of to the United States. Trump seems to consistently be losing his influence over the world and indeed his own country, and so when you go over to China, you can see that the situation is pretty much the opposite. We'll wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Trump is losing his influence in the US. I mean, how could this possibly be the case? He wants to be. Everyone's friends. Have one scene is rather sweet tweets lately.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Why would Kim Jong UN insult me by calling me old when I would never call him short and fat? Oh, well, I try so hard to be his friend and maybe someday that will happen. Yes. It's definitely no surprise that the United States is losing its influence over the world in just a few months. Trump has gone from nuclear war to school, the odd fights. All right. Anyway, back to the serious stuff. The fact is that although Tszujing thing isn't the president of the world's leading power, he does control China's leadership tightly, a country which is one of the most important economic engines on the

Speaker 2:          02:02          onyx.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Of course for Beijing. Trump has been something like the lottery Jackpot. Nationalism and Donald Trump's mistakes have allowed Xi Jinping, the president of the world's largest dictatorship to present his candidacy, has this sort of global political leader. In January, 2017 of the Davis Forum, Xi Jinping promised that China would become nothing less than the champion of globalization, of free trade and even the fight against climate change, thus Beijing aspirants, but its grasp on the terrain that has been lost by watching it to mention, well, you know, freedom and so all those other sorts of apparently unimportant things,

Speaker 3:          02:55          Adi, by, by the sun, Shins are, you'll push out and

Speaker 1:          03:00          comes off. Now what happened in the last Chinese Communist Party Congress, how much power does Xi Jinping have and what does he wants? Well, we're going to discuss all of this, but first, let's take a look at China today,

Speaker 2:          03:22          but new China.

Speaker 1:          03:27          You think that China is still a country where people live in deplorable conditions, breaking them backs been miserable wages. Well, I'm sorry, but the reality is you're actually pretty wrong. If you think that 2018 will be the 40th anniversary of China's reform and open policy in this country. It's changed a lot in that time. China is no longer a low income country, but indeed a middle income country

Speaker 2:          03:48          tree

Speaker 1:          03:55          taking price differences into account is it that purchasing power parity of about $16,000, which is bigger than both Columbia and Brazil, comedy has changed and nowadays services are the most important activity example in electronic commerce, the sector in which the country is beating Europe and even the United States. China represents no less than 40 percent of all global transactions. The same can be said of a mobile payments which is so popular in this country that it's market reached five point $5,000,000,000,000 in 2016, which is 50 times more than the United States could be described as. Not Bad. I mean that growth has been so large, but just in the last six years, China's private consumption is growing by two point $5,000,000,000,000 and announced that equals India's entire GDP. Therefore, when you visit one of those giant Chinese cities, it's not at all uncommon to find a city full of skyscrapers, billionaires, and high speed trains. Hold on just a second because China's poverty continues and in general, there is a really large difference between the countries, cities and the countries, rural areas which remained poor, very poor. In fact, they're so poor that 43 million people, almost the entire population of Spain, by the way, still live in extreme poverty, earning less than $1 a day, and not only that, almost 40 percent of Chinese people still live at fairly low economic level. Although the situation is much better than a few decades ago.

Speaker 1:          05:44          This is all true, but as I said before, things are changing very quickly and we can no longer think of China as we did 2010, even just five years ago.

Speaker 2:          05:59          Way

Speaker 1:          06:00          You talking about poverty is an interesting fact. Do you know how the Chinese government fights against poverty? Well, one of its main strategies is actually creating new businesses and cooperatives in the poorest of communities. To this ends. The government has granted almost $400,000,000,000 in small loans to help launch several companies and they not only focus on money, but also unculture. The evening news is filled with tales of rejuvenated communities and villagers turned entrepreneurs heaping praise on Mr c dot and the government for providing loans and new apartments. Javier Hernandez, China correspondent for the New York Times. Yes, yes. I know Xi Jinping in practically every country leader talk a lot about Chinese style socialism. The truth is that this is just a reference to a kind of capitalist model locked up within a dictatorship. China isn't an ideological dictatorship, Norris, socialist or communist one. It's just simply a dictatorship. Having said that, now let's talk a little bit about aging thing. The person leading this new China with almost total power CGMP, the leader

Speaker 1:          07:14          born in 1953. We could say that Xi Jinping is a pretty interesting dude. On the one hand, he's probably the Chinese leader who's had the most contact with the West. His daughter studied at Harvard. His sister even lives in Canada, and he has visited the United States several times. In fact, in 2012 when he visited the United States as vice president of China, he made a somewhat peculiar stop. He went to Iowa. Well, at this point you're probably wondering, well, why did he go to Iowa? Well, the fact is that in 1985 when she drink thing was a young party, county secretary in China, he traveled to Iowa to investigate agriculture related issues, so in 2010 we went to see the family that had stayed with at the time and he brought them presence. Pretty cool, right? In addition, the president, she's Yankee side. It doesn't end there. He's also known to love Hollywood movies.

Speaker 1:          08:00          There is also another side to this since he became China's highest authority five years ago because government has been characterized for having the most censorship and repression for a very long time. We only need to take a look at the latest cybersecurity law, which seeks to control even more of the Internet in China by restricting anonymity in doing this is to such an extent that also social network accounts have to be backed by ANA identifying citizen further. It's been decades since China saw such a strong leader. We could say that all this propaganda as well, it greatly, but that's not really surprising now is that

Speaker 2:          08:38          the fact

Speaker 1:          08:39          is that in these five years, Xi Jinping has made several changes in China starting with the army reform and they're very active foreign policy. We saw it here at visual politic, how Xi Jingping has done invested national resources towards foreign policy. A good example is this new silk road macro project which aims to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in several countries, but generally that greatest commitments has definitely been the fight against corruption and this is seriously, yeah,

Speaker 2:          09:06          sure.

Speaker 1:          09:07          Aging thing came to power. If a one and a half million members of the Communist Party have been sanctioned and nearly 300,000 different prosecutors, including 43 members of the central committee, there's more within the framework of this fight against corruption. $13,000. The officers have been dismissed and it's more than 50 generals have been in prisons. Of course, as you might expect. Not everyone sees this battle as clean and honest. It's a selective anticorruption campaign. It's nature is the selective protection of corruption. When you purge some corrupt officials, you're protecting the others, you protect the corrupt system and you protect correct people who support you about tall Chinese activist. Yes. Xi Jinping has mostly relieved his political rivals. Coincidence, of course. It's very clear that teaching thing has gained a lot of power in these five years. This was certainly observed in the last Chinese Communist Party Congress, the most important political event in the country, which is held every five years.

Speaker 2:          10:03          Yes,

Speaker 1:          10:09          19th congress.

Speaker 1:          10:13          The Chinese Communist Party, Congress held between October the 18th and 24th 2017 was quite peculiar, especially because it may have been the most austere congress that the Chinese Communist Party is celebrated in many, many years. On this occasion, some amenities, they were removed out. Some examples. Well, among other things, there was no lavish buffets. There was no hairdressing facials and tailoring services. I mean, all of these used to be offered for free to participants and it's almost become a tradition, but if this was the congress at which Xi Jinping's adoration reached its highest point, something that, as you can imagine in China, means being put on an almost now like level years ago.

Speaker 1:          10:54          I said he would be China's most powerful leader since dms helping. I was wrong. He is now China's most powerful leader since Kevin Rudd, Australia's former prime minister. See, this congress led to the decision that these so called Xi Jinping thought should be included in the communist party constitution. This may seem a bit strange, but it actually means that Xi Jinping is no longer just another leader. He is in fact the leader, the leader whose words formed the parties own ideology. It means see is essentially unassailable if you challenge. See, you are challenging the party and you would never want to be against the party. Bill Bishop, publisher of the Sinocism newsletter. So far, only males and Dong has received such an honor in life, but that's not all. Apparently a president's mandate is limited to 10 years, which means that this would be Xi Jinping's last time, but during the military, because no successor was considered during the congress, which leads us to believe that Xi Jinping may be at least aspiring to a third term Chinese universities scrambled to open centers to study president and Ping thought, but anyway, but he owns the Chinese border. This congress helps define three major priorities for the Chinese government in upcoming years. First, there's the economy, which means fighting poverty and opening up more to the world. Seconds, there's the idea of launching even stronger foreign policies. And third, start worrying about the environments and you know, even though I said there were three priorities that is kind of a fourth and it's actually a pretty clear one. And that's consolidate the communist party's power.

Speaker 1:          12:29          And this is because we know two things for sure on the one hand that Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party will stay for a long time. And on the other hand, China will reclaim its role as a superpower. So the reality is we're going to have to get used to taking Beijing into accounts and now it's your turn. We've got an important question. Who Do you think will leave power first? Will it be Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin?
