Speaker 1:          00:00          Imagine that you could buy stocks in your uncle's farm and guess I know that assumes that your uncle has a farm. Let's say it's a small farm, it's got some cows, etc. And you can buy stocks from his company, something you would do on the stock market, just like you deal with big companies like apple, exxon, or chevron thing. I'm crAzy. Well, actually I'm not at all and at the end of this video you're going to see exactly where I'm coming from.

Speaker 1:          00:34          Let's say you want to start a company, a traditional company. Let's stick to the example of California that's going to produce milk and other dairy products. What is the first thing that you need? Well, of course that's going to be money. You need money to buy the property. The facilities as well as the all important was so where can you get the money to do this? Well, the first option of course is going to be to go to the bank, but this has a whole bunch of issues. The first one is that if it wasn't risky enough to start your own company, having a loan makes it even more risky. You could end up bankrupt and in debt. Besides then there's the whole thing that the bank have might actually not give you that loan. If you've ever tried to get a loan start company, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:17          It's pretty hard to convince a banker to lend you any money. So let's. First of all, disregard of a bank option. The next alternative is a venture capitalist. You know those guys out in silicon valley. These people were the loads of cash and a willingness to invest in young talents just like you. I mean who knows, maybe a small farm might become the next industry been off, but then you run into the problem that you probably don't know any venture capitalists, especially if you're somewhere like in the middle of India. so there's no banks, there's new venture capitalists, but maybe a parents are rich, but if they're not, well I guess that's not any help. So just hold on for a minute because I think I have an idea what if you could already entered the stock market, you know, something like wall street where general motors and mcdonald's operate the good thing and now the stock market is, you don't need to know a millionaire to get funding. There aren't thousands of small investors out there who buy stocks every day. So let's say you divide your company into 10,000 stocks in each of them has an initial price of $10 and people no matter where they live can buy those shares.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Say maybe there's a guy in Kansas who buys one stock in the zero women in France. He buys 10 this way with no contacts and no bank loans. You can get the funding you need. You just need a good idea and a bit of hard work, right?

Speaker 2:          02:46          Well

Speaker 1:          02:47          hold on a second. Didn't get too excited. There's a pretty major problem here. For instance, if you want to get into the New York stock exchange, your company, it should have already made at least $10,000,000 in the last three years. And that's just the beginning. There are lots and lots of regulations that you have to meet. well, this is the situation that the guys from hako sky agricultural company we're in, they lived in Russia and they wanted to start a cow farm and they had no money so. Well, what do you think they did? Well? Check it out.

Speaker 1:          03:17          back to coco skier agricultural company plans to launch an ico named milk coin to fund a dairy farm. Yep. You heard that right? These farmers launch their own cryptocurrency. It's basically their own version of bitcoin. They advertised it on their website and launched the offer of these new coins. This is what we call an initial coin offering or ico. So now you might be wondering, well, why would I buy another cryptocurrency bitcoin enough? Now you might just think that you're just buying some sort of virtual coin here, but the reality is you're actually buying stocks and you're doing it without going through the traditional stock markets. But at the end of this video, I'm going to tell you what happens with this company, but the fact is they're not the only example.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Forty eight percent of those were successful last year, but startups still managEd to raise five point $6,000,000,000. Yes, if you have. That appears to be a brand new way of getting money to start a company and it's available for everybody right now, but hold on just a minute because not everything is a beautiful and as you can imagine, these icrs seem like a scam as paradise. So the question is can we really trust this brand new way of starting companies and what does Switzerland and have to do with all of this today? We're going to answer all of these questions, but before we do as usual, let's take a look back at the history coins versus tokens. In the year 2013, everyone in the tech industry was already pretty aware of bitcoin in silicon valley. They were celebrating all kinds of events and talking about the future of this currency.

Speaker 2:          04:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:53          In one of them, that was a man called j dot r with it. This man had a very funny idea. He said we could create alternative currencies that using the same technology as bitcoin would have different rules and how are you going to pay all the itv, but he would design all of this. They asked him, he said that instead of looking for a venture capitalist, he could sell some notes, what we call a token that will be exchanged for coins, swamps. They were created, and this is how the first initial Coin offering was created,

Speaker 2:          05:26          but before

Speaker 1:          05:26          we continue, many of you might be wondering, well, what exactly is a token? Well, tokens are any elements that can be changed in a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are one kind of token, but there are many more. On the one hand, we have those that give a right to its owner. For instance, those notes that you could exchange for brand new currencies when they are created. On the other hand, we have the tokens that are based on an asset. This would be the case, so if the stocks at the russian farmers having one of their tokens means having a share of their company visit initial public offering of tokens became fashionable in the year 2014. So why was that? What exactly happens In this year? Well, that was the year when the second most famous cryptocurrency was created.

Speaker 3:          06:16          The decentralized platform that might displace today's institutions.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Unlike bitcoin, we all know who is behind a theory. This is a company that offers way more than a cryptocurrency. They also offer a system so other people can create their own cryptocurrency isn't in their own tokens. For example. Do you remember this other video where I told you about how a spanish bank is using blockchains, give corporate loans? Well, if theory in is the platform that they use, we are only talking about spanish banks here. The theory has made it really easy for lots of people to start creating different financial products on

Speaker 4:          06:51          chain

Speaker 3:          06:54          theory and rush has been unleashed. Isis ceos are in fashion in the tech investment world.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Since then, lots of companies are getting financed this way. For example, serum labs, a swiss company that is about to launch their own smartphone, this company has got more than a hundred and $18,000,000 thanks to one of the most successful ice a's in history, and of course there are all kinds of internet companies that have been born with this system, but just hold on a second because not everything is so great. Ico is they've got no regulation whatsoever, so you can certainly imagine there are some problems.

Speaker 3:          07:33          How to create an ico scam in five simple steps.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Now you might be wondering, well, what's the difference between an ico and a website like kickstarter? Well, that's actually pretty easy to onset. If you support some kickstarter project, you can't sell any shares on an ico. You can buy a token or a coin and if it rises higher and market value, you can sell it to another investor. The only problem is that here there is no financial police or fcc running against the bad guys. So yes, there were plenty of people who thought they could get rich really quick and then ended up losing a ton of money. For example, saved ride was a german company that wanted to make a cryptocurrency based credit card. It has all the buzzwords to make speculators happy and everything seemed great. The technology Was there and it was very disruptive. They got $50,000,000 to launch it, so once they got their money, what do you think happens? Well, they just disappeared and since there was no public register whatsoever, it's almost impossible to find the owner.

Speaker 1:          08:44          I'm sure you've all seen the ads onlIne for coins and tokens and things that promise a whole ton of profits. I mean for a better understanding, even the ceo of a theory and butter like butter and recognized that most of the ico is a scam. As you can imagine. Governments have already started to act. China has banned ics. America seems to be following a similar path. Other countries like Estonia said that it's okay to invest in. Ico is for everyone except estonian citizens, so they're essentially saying something like, oh yeah, man, you can totally scam anyone you like, just not my own citizens. Cool. Nonetheless, there is one country that has found an intermediate solution. They weren't banned. Ico is, but they will not let them go unregulated as they are today. And what country am I talking about? Well, let me give you a clear. It's probably the channel we've talked to most about here on visual politic already knows. Well, yes, of course. We're talking about sir, when the krypto nation. During that video we made about Switzerland there we talked about kansan called zog, which has the lowest taxes in the car.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Well guess what? The theory and has its headquarters. Having the biggest cryptocurrency company in your country means that you also have the biggest experts on the mass of that. So most of the ico is, are done on swift service. And of course the swiss government soon realize that, uh, with or without scams, this was a multi million dollar.

Speaker 2:          10:11          The street

Speaker 1:          10:16          wants to be the world capital of cryptocurrency. Four of the 10 biggest initial coin offerings last year. We're in Switzerland more than any other country. This is why some swiss municipalities let the citizens pay taxes or even fines with cryptocurrencies as having less than 30,000 inhabitants is already the home of 400 blockchain based companies and the regional government is already doing trials. To use this technology to organize referendums, you probably already know that referendums and direct democracy are essential in the swiss political system, so well now they want to do it with blockchain and of course Switzerland wants to become the pioneer in ico regulations too. This financial authority releases ico specific regulatory guidelines. For example, any company that wants to make an ico in Switzerland, we'll have to do it through a swiss company. This means they will have to regIster, then have to give their name and physical address. This way it will be easier to chase terrorists, knockers or scammers. As you can imagine, these regulations, well, they're starting to work and many companies have already gone to other tax havens like the cayman islands, which offer a complete doggy dog environments where you can essentially do whatever you want.

Speaker 1:          11:34          This is the short term price you have to pay in order to have a stable environment. We're talking about a wells that still needs a lot of work before it becomes a mature market. One thing is for sure it has pLenty of possibilities. Many scams, lots of money laundering and some easy money to be made. So the swiss way seems to be the smartest far yes and new technology has come. It is risky, but it has many possibilities to instead of banning us or letting it run completely free, the best option is to regulate it. This way we take the good and to avoid the bad, by the way, going all the way back to our russian friends, the ones you wanted to finance their farm with cryptocurrency. Well, we've got some bad news

Speaker 2:          12:12          it for you

Speaker 3:          12:16          originally since milk coin raised only two percent of the soft cap. We're giving back all funds that we received. We will start the return on the 21st of November. Huge thanks to our backers.

Speaker 1:          12:26          Now the question becomes, do you think other countries will follow the swiss example? It is clear that we still need more time for the ico market to grow and become mature, but do you think it can be the capitalist revolution that will open the entry barriers to starting a company?
