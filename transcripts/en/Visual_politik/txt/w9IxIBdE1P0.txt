Speaker 1:          00:00          First is Spanish colony. Then in American one Puerto Rico, a small islands in the Caribbean. It defines itself as a free state associated with the United States Associated State who citizens have American citizenship, but unless they move to another state, cannot vote in the presidential elections, and even though they have a representative in Congress, he also lacks a vote.

Speaker 2:          00:29          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:29          well, the major issues be they political, economic or military lions at the federal jurisdiction of the United States. Lately, there's been a lot of talk about this territory. Not only because in September of 2017 they suffered the harsh impacts of Hurricane Maria, but also because a few months before in May of that same year, Puerto Rico declared itself bankrupts. After more than 10 years of economic crisis sweater, Rico's public accounts could no longer keep going. This is because the island's public dense deposit is $70 billion, ends another $50 billion in future payment commitments such as pensions, Stevia, we're talking about figures that are huge for an island. The belly has more than 3 million inhabitants because of this. In recent years, Puerto Rico has become known source of as the grease of the Caribbean. The simple fact of the matter is, dear viewer, Puerto Rico is insolvent, but how exactly did they get to this point? Well, listen up.

Speaker 2:          01:26          Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:30          let me, that is a lot of discussion going on about how to solve Puerto Rico's serious crisis and how to stop the exodus that the island is suffering, which we saw in a previous video, but first of all, to address this issue, I think we need to answer a question and that's of course what I'll know if it happens. Yeah. What caused pressure rico to become quite soon in Sylvan? What led to it becoming such a broke island? Well, of course the grade culprit here is the Puerto Rican government itself. The government that has been spending uncontrollably for decades and has many suspicions of corruption as an absolute disdain for production. The going beyond his Puerto Rico's government. Washington also holds a large amount of responsibility for this whole mess. Washington's responsibilities. In fact, so great that it wouldn't be unreasonable to save that the federal government has been the main driver of Puerto Rico's bankruptcy. Yep. You heard that right? The United States says bombarded Puerto Rico with five policies whose results were absolutely devastating. Five policies concerning trade regulations, salaries and welfare. And if you don't believe me, yes. Well, keep on listening. It's free debt with this supposed intention of aiding the Puerto Rican economy and helping it's government access the capital markets at the dawn of the Jones Schaffrath Act, Washington creators, a triple municipal state and federal exemption on Puerto Rico's debts interests. Thus, if any US citizen purchased Puerto Rico's public desk, he or she was exempt from paying taxes on the interest that was received.

Speaker 1:          03:20          In other words, if an American bought a dance from a company, they had to pay taxes on the returns that they obtained. But if he or she invested in the debt of Puerto Rico's politicians, he or she didn't have to pay any tax at all. So you might imagine that with such attractive conditions, people would be queuing up to lend money to the islands governments. It was easy money. The local politicians didn't take long to spend and it was aimed at achieving a single objective and that was winning or should they really say buying votes? I mean, what better scenario could we can cox for irresponsible politicians acts engineering still logic while the federal government's encouraged the island to get deeply indebted, it also made things harder for the private economy. In 2006 Congress abolish the so called section nine three six of the tax code, a section that provided significant benefits for the companies that invested in the islands. And let's not forget here that Puerto Rico is the poorest territory in the United States. Well, the fact is that this incentive model, it was very, very successful, but years it helps Puerto Rico grow a loss even leading to it becoming a manufacturing and pharmaceutical powerhouse.

Speaker 1:          04:41          The ones, the incentives were gone in 2006 two years before the great international financial crisis, Puerto Rico began to fall into the best overnight to the condition of the companies that had been supporting. Puerto Rico changed drastically, forcing investments in the island to sync legal security. And it was a bit of a joke, but that's not even close to being all hair merchant, marine law,

Speaker 1:          05:12          maybe the most controversial points of all and at the same time it's the most absurd law. The Jones Act, which passed in 1920 and distill in force for bids, foreign flag vessels from transporting goods between two United States ports. Thus they ship loaded with containers coming from China cannot stop in Puerto Rico because it has to continue on to the mainland. They're the container is destined for Puerto Rico are unloaded and then loaded onto another ship. This time with a US flag and crew, which is obviously very expensive. It's like what's the result of all of this? What Question Rico? It has the most expensive shipping costs of all Caribbean countries. It's something that not only industry but also he makes exports more expensive and reduces every prayer to wrekin's purchasing power.

Speaker 2:          05:55          In fact, fax it

Speaker 1:          05:56          to get an idea of this loss

Speaker 2:          05:58          implications. We should mention that evenly. Puerto Rico has an average income, approximately half of that of Mississippi and is poorer than any state in the United States. It's cost of living surpasses the average state. All of this leads to a really crazy situation.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Minimum wage and welfare policy,

Speaker 2:          06:22          uh,

Speaker 1:          06:23          full of that wasn't enough. Believe me, there is more. The average salary in Puerto Rico is the same as the federal minimum wage. That is $7 and 25 cents per hour. The thing is that as we've seen, both the development level and the average income in Puerto Rico are much lower than those of the US states causing this policies distorting effects to be, well, pretty enormous.

Speaker 2:          06:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:48          You see the federal minimum wage in New York or Illinois, matter of fact, very few people, but in Puerto Rico it's really different. The federal minimum wage is the equivalent of 77% of the average salary in Puerto Rico. That is the average salary of every profession and every job on the island.

Speaker 1:          07:06          This is led only one in three people of working age to actually do so. And if this number, it wasn't already abnormally low, over a quarter of people with jobs, I think worked for the government. This means that less than 25% of the island's population works in the actual productive economy. On the other hand, the federal regulation also implies an abnormally high level of social benefits for Puerto Rico's parameters. In fact, studies show that for many families it is more convenient to receive social aids than to actually go to work because the income they'll receive is substantially higher. Well, folks, the results of these five federal policies has led to a huge crisis, a crisis that has lasted more than 10 years, which has caused or has at least fuels the island's bankruptcy and just generated a gigantic exodus of people who escaped to the consonants, especially of course the youngest.

Speaker 1:          08:04          As we saw here on visual politic in a previous video, I need the last 10 years, 500,000 Puerto Rican stuff, packed their bags and to moved to the continents. That's one in every seven people. There's a lot of talk about how to solve the island's problems, but the question is, is Puerto Rico's current connection with the United States compatible with any of these solutions?
