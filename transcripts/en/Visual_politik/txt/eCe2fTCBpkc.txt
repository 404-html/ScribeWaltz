Speaker 1:          00:07          The global competency lab is a region with 12 countries that have just one thing in common and that's that they all hate each other. For decades, most of these countries were a big part of a federation called Yugoslavia, which had a socialist system very similar to that of the Soviet Union. After the fall of communism, the Yugoslavian estate broke apart and all the regions separated from each other in the most violent way possible, either about my age or slightly older you might remember the terrible bulk and was a showcase of the worst part of the human condition. As all of this happens just a few kilometers away from Italy and from Greece, so while the rest of Europe enjoyed a comfortable and peaceful existence, this region's inhabitants were killing each other. Since then, the Balkans in one of Europe's poorest regions. Some people call it the Bermuda triangle of economics because when someone invests that money mysteriously disappears. Probably new country like Albania is a bit like traveling 50 years in the past. Other countries like Serbia or growing fairly fast lately, but there are still miles away from being able to join the European Union. Greece, which is the best boy in the classroom, is bankrupt and has an unemployment rate of 21 percent and otherwise this doesn't look like a good country for doing business. Right? Well, give you A. China thinks it is.

Speaker 2:          01:33          Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:35          China is putting billions of pounds worth of investment into Greece and other Balkan countries to create a new silk road from the Mediterranean into the heart. The European Union, we aren't talking about almost $20,000,000,000. This is the same cost as hosting the Olympic Games and it's all in a region where nobody else seems to invest a penny. China is bought harbor and is now building brand new railroads that will connect to the Balkans with Budapest in Hungary and that might ended up in Germany, but not only that, the Chinese government is paving the way for private investments. Can you imagine Chinese factories on the outskirts of Belgrade and Alley Express logistics center in the middle of Athens? Bob, this might be a reality sooner than you might have

Speaker 2:          02:15          facts

Speaker 1:          02:19          for better understanding. If we look at it relative to that population, China is showing a bigger interest in Greece, Australia than it is in Germany, so now the question is why is China so interested in the Balkans? Isn't this a poor, corrupt, and business unfriendly region? What is China trying to achieve here? Well, today we are going to answer all of these questions, but as usual before we do a second look back at the history tree for sale in the year 2010, Greece started that budget cuts. The whole country was bankrupt and the European Union agreed to bail them out with money from it's wealthiest members. Boss can exchange. The Greek government was supposed to control that spending. Since then, Greece has gone through all kinds of political and financial crisis. Unemployment Sims, he doesn't stop growing. It's now at more than 20 percent since poverty is on the rise too, for a better understanding. Greek public desk is almost twice that of their entire gross domestic product, and on top of all of this grease seems to be allergic to business, ev, rampant corruption, red tape, and all kinds of laws that have created a country with almost no major companies.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Brussels demands is that the government of Alexis Tsipras make reforms and sell the state owned companies, but there was a big problem here being in the situation that they were. Nobody wanted to buy the Greek governments property, so they simply had to drop their prices to rock bottom. In other words, Greece was and still is in a desperate situation now, guests, you can smell desperation from miles and miles away. Yup. That would be China.

Speaker 1:          04:01          China's costco acquires 51 percent stake in pirates passport. When this deal, China was killing two birds with one stone. On the one hand, it's one of their companies was buying one of the main ports in the Mediterranean seat on the other. The government of Xi Jinping with his commitments to investing at 3 billion more dollars in the country was buying it from this angle ally in sight, the EU and. Yes. Yes, yes. I know what you'll now thinking. The Greek presidents, Alexis suppressed the European left Rockstar, the man who would never sell his principles to an evil rich guy. No matter how much money was put on the table. Yeah, yeah. We need that.

Speaker 3:          04:37          Breeze blocks used criticism at UN of China's human rights record. Greece has vetoed a European Union condemnation of China's human rights record at the UN infuriating diplomats and rights organizations. You said the move undermine that used position as a defender of human,

Speaker 2:          04:55          right?

Speaker 1:          05:00          Just a minute, because this is not only about politics here. Let's take a look at it from an economic perspective. Now, a Chinese company controls one of the biggest ports in Europe. This means Chinese businesses will find it easier than ever to reload their products into one of the wealthiest markets on the planet. Europe, but still has a little problem here from the Pi report. Berlin, we have more than 2000, 300 kilometers of distance on the way. We have poor countries with poor roads and poor railways, but hold on just a second day because China has already thought of this. Do you remember the one belt? One road projects. This is brands. New Silk Road, Xi Jinping wants to create. This is a network of infrastructure that is meant to connect the entire wells and in Europe the silkroad will go through the Balkans.

Speaker 2:          05:51          Oh, great.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Budapest railway construction starts at the same time. Chinese consulting companies are working to renovate railroads between Greece and Macedonia. The goal is to be able to have one shipment, Madigan pirates and crossing the whole Balkan peninsula at a hundred and 60 kilometers an hour, and all of this is cheaper to build here than intercity. I mean, think about it. The vulcans have cheap land, cheap salaries and their governments are welcoming this Chinese money with open arms. As we said at the beginning, the Balkans still feel a bit like the aftermath of the wars from the 19th. Let me see sooner like Bill Craig, you can still see the ruins from the NATO bombings in 1999. A country like Montenegro doesn't even have a railroad that connects it with Bosnia or Croatia despite sharing a border. Don't forget that except for Greece and Coratia, none of these countries are you members. This means that they hardly get any Brussels money to rebuild, so these Chinese loans, $70 from heaven speak about this with European countries. They say, why China? Because they have the money to be honest. Zerana, Z, Milosevic, Serbian minister of transportation, but hold on just a second here because this is not the end of the story. What if China wants to go even further?

Speaker 1:          07:11          Trainees, factories in Europe, we'll know it. China started grabbing thanks to the foreign companies that set up in these special economic science, but the truth is the real appeal of China during the nineties was the lower wages, however things they've now changed. Take a look at this chart today. The average salary in a city like Shanghai is almost the same as that in Greece and almost double that of the Saudi and salary. This means for a Chinese company, Sedia is something close to what Shen Zen used to be for an American. There's also the fact that said the uneducation is relatively good and they're close to Germany in summary, cheap labor, well educated population, and it's close to one of the world's most appealing markets. This is an unexplored paradise.

Speaker 1:          07:58          China's Habib signs agreement to buy serving steel plant. Of course, this news is from 2016 and we still don't have that many examples, but that aren't enough cases to show a clear trends. Chinese companies want to start manufacturing things in Europe and the Balkans. Other perfect place to do that. Most specifically. Then looking at Sandia, this explains why this year, Xi Jinping himself paid a visit to Belgrade or why Huawei has already invested at a fortune to improved telecommunications in the country. Last year, that's 2017. The Bank of China opens their first Serbian officers. So in a way we could say that the relationship between these two countries where it really couldn't be any better right now, but I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. I mean very rarely a visual politic. Do we tell you that corruption is a friend of foreign investments and when it comes to corruption, sedia certainly starts to look less like a paradise, but make no mistake. Chinese companies are experts in dealing with this. In fact, Chinese businessmen are quite comfortable in hostile environments. They have demonstrated this when they built those textile factories in Ethiopia, and let's be honest here, China itself isn't exactly a haven of transparency and democracy either.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Meanwhile, as soon as investment came to the Balkans, the regions fondness for Europe, it started going down in 2012. Seventy percent of Serbs wanted to join the European Union. Some people were even willing to change that alphabet. To do that. As you probably know, Serbian is a Slavic language and it's written in cyrillic characters. Some intellectuals wanted to change it to a Latin alphabet is the same way you Croatians dips, but now, well, this love of Europe, it's dropped to 35 percent at the end of the day with money flowing into China. Well, he really wants Brussels funding. In past presidential elections, none of the main candidates talked about joining the European Union. Nevertheless, nobody in Brussels seemed to be too worried about that. You said only China has been capable of finding business opportunities in this part of the world. The rest of Europe still sees this as a political and economic desert. The same happens in many parts of Africa. When nobody dead to invest, all of a sudden Beijing money came in and now some of these countries are growing like this note.

Speaker 1:          10:10          So the question is now where we see an awakening in the Balkans is the same way. We've seen it in some African countries and he could grease Saudi and perhaps even Bosnia. They come a brand new industrial cluster for Chinese companies.
