Speaker 1:          00:00          With a population of over 30 million people, period, the fourth biggest country in Latin America, one of the richest countries in the world in terms of biodiversity and natural resources in this vast in country, we can find among other things the biggest silver reserves, the third biggest zinc and copper reserves, as well as the sixth biggest gold reserves in the world. In today's video, we're going to be talking all about Peru equals youtube politic. Now, Peru is still ain't poor country and there is still a lot of work to be done when it comes to its industrial framework, but despite this, Peru stands out among its Latin American neighbors as an example of it. Reforms done right and some say that if this process continues, we're soon going to be talking about Peru as a great Latin American power. Lima, it's capital city already has a higher GDP. Even

Speaker 2:          01:04          economic

Speaker 1:          01:07          in the last decade has recorded the second biggest growth rate of all countries in Latin America in the same period, it's GDP has more than doubled. The investment rate has gone from 13 percent of GDP to 20 percent under the poverty rates. This is the percentage of people who can't afford basic things like food, clothes, education, and healthcare has dropped from rates of over 50 percent in the year, 2000 to 22 percent today. This is a reduction of more than half, which is not bad at all. It's a country with the highest poverty reduction rate in Latin America during the last 13 years and say on top of all that Peru is one of the least indebted countries in Latin America. Bands in fact is one of the least indebted in the whole world. This is due to a strong determination to use public funds responsibly. This is an achievement of perused previous governments which were led by Alan Garcia. I'm Zella on polydor. Because of these leaders, the public debt has been reduced to less than 50 percent since the year 2000. That is still. How did it reach a political consensus that maintain stability with the government's budget while also making pro markets policy?

Speaker 3:          02:26          Yeah, but one more and go being with them

Speaker 1:          02:35          now, this is probably one of the most interesting things about Peru and it's also where they can see each other countries even valuable lesson. We recently made a video talking about the disaster that is Venezuela, but the interesting thing is that peruse economic situation was pretty similar to Venezuela's in the 19 eighties. So let's have a look at what happened. Eight, these prices

Speaker 4:          03:02          in the 19 seventies and the beginning of the 19 eighties, the Peruvian government bets on boosting the Peruvian economy, fruit public investments, they wanted to replace imports and to restrict the sale of foreign products. To achieve this, they had to borrow money which shot up the public debt. The results were so bad, the when the oil crisis happened in 1979 and their economic growth slowed down, peruse government started to have so many problems that in 1983 they had to suspend their payments to their data's. In other words, they failed to pay their debts because they ran out of money and the Peruvian government collapsed. From that moment, things went from bad to worse, and when Alan Garcia came to power in 1985, the entire country was a bit of a disaster. This is when the government started to intervene on a massive scale. They started fixing prices and in the labor markets, they reinforced the inboard replacement policies which are limited the number of products that were available to buy and setting an average tariff which reached 66 percent. Okay. The

Speaker 1:          04:13          public deficit went through the roof and the informal economy became the norm, so even though there were more than a hundred taxes, the state simply couldn't collect them, and on top of all that, the governments had collapsed, so no one wanted to lend them money. Now you might be wondering what exactly did career do? Well, they started to print more money, which basically made the [inaudible] Berean currency worth about as much as monopoly money, as if all of that wasn't enough for purview to deal with. They also have to deal with the narco traffic and terrorist actions by groups such as Mrta and Sendero Luminoso, which were causing tens of thousands of deaths sold across the country because we can throw in as soon as band does inadequate. Well, what was the results of all this wild? By the end of the decades, GDP, you had dropped by 25 percent. Further its GDP per capita was similar to the 19 sixties, ends.

Speaker 1:          05:10          Inflation every year was about 7,500 percent. It was at this point that the World Bank recognized Peru as one of the poorest countries in the world, so you can throw them, toby, me receive, but according to the situation was so grave that the World Bank estimates that if this had never happened for real GDP and purchasing power parity, would today be similar to Israelis, Spain, or South Korea's no more, no less. In many ways, the crisis that Peru faced was very similar to the crisis facing Venezuela today. For example, you can see lots of public spending, potency of taxes, lots of printing money, or dropping the price of commodities. Oh, and also plenty of violence, so when we released our video about Venezuela, many people asked what we would do to solve the problem. Well, let's have a look at what [inaudible] did

Speaker 5:          06:15          way to prosperity.

Speaker 1:          06:20          90 a strong plan of reforms and economic stabilization began and in fact this is the same plan that really does still exist today. It passed through the following stages in order to slow down inflation. First of all, the it was replaced by a new currency, the new sole. In addition to this, the dollarization over the economy was allowed, which is essentially where US dollars are used in place of a national currency from vast moments. Monetary stability in the country became a national priority. The tax system was changed and greatly simplified with the elimination of 64 taxes. Further, the pension system was also reformed and the Chilean system was used as a model, but there were also many improvements made. This is actually quite a controversial topic and something that we're going to be addressing in a future of visual politic videos like don't forget to subscribe.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Further, an ambitious program to attract investors and privatized public utilities was put into motion Syrian companies such as Aero Peru, Electra Lehman and the Peruvian telephone company will put into private hands a trade openness strategy was put into place which reduced that ridiculously high, 66 percent tariff to something closer to one point five percent. At the same time. As this happened, numerous free trade deals were signed, including a very important ones with the United States as well as the European Union. Then in 2002, a gradual decentralization of power started happening. The result of this was that most public investment spending today happens with regions and municipalities, and finally and probably the most important points was their commitments to budgetary stability. This is something that since it was put into place, every government has respected.

Speaker 1:          08:00          It's talking about consequences. It's actually in 1999 and law was put into place called the fiscal transparency and prudent snore. This restricts the discretionary power of governments to spend more than they receive. This includes correct developments for public deficit situations. Many experts on the subject contest. This is one of the most important laws in the history of Peru bus. It's not all roses. I don't think that we've forgotten the dark side of this was the nineties. Tell him his regime. This was an authoritarian regime and the president of it is now serving a 25 year jail time. He was convicted for crimes against humanity and its corruption. So it was important to keep in mind is the situation that Venezuela faces today is similar to the situation that [inaudible] faced. So keep in mind there's always a way out

Speaker 2:          08:59          today.

Speaker 1:          09:01          So now you might have in your mind the question, why is Peru still a poor country today? As we said at the beginning of this video, the institutional shortfalls ends, the challenges that faces today on many among them. We can't stress enough the high degree of legal uncertainty and corruption. This is something that we can definitely see with the death squads case. This is where under his regime from 2011 to 2015, a group of policemen killed innocent people for money. Those guilds included a general and a major firm peruse national police further are extremely high levels of crime and there's also the chance that the mining industry will face the same Renzi, a problems that one faces today. Not to mention, there is a very sharp difference between the living standards in different regions. On the fifth of June, 2016, the second rounds of presidential elections were held where Pedro Pablo Kaczynski was elected as the new president of the Republic of Peru. These elections were the closest in peruse history and cruises. Inscape beat out his rival Keiko for him Maury, who by the way is Alberto. For him or his daughter, he beats her by just 40,000 votes. The policies announced buying Kaczynski include to keep working on the agenda of pushing competitiveness and trade openness. In this regard. He has pledged to reduce taxes by 10 percent. The smes that small or medium sized enterprises as well as battle against bureaucracy remove unnecessary regulations and to pursue regional economic integrations similar to the TPP or RCP led by teachers,

Speaker 1:          10:36          ski against to remain at the helmet financial, all of the problems that are affecting Peru despite his relative political weakness because they're not very friendly congress, I'm sure that the grief of Peru will continue and will remain a leader in growth for Latin America and maybe in a few years. Peru, which is a young nation with an average age of 27, could follow the example of the Asian tigers and it gets transformed into a major global power. So that is our opinion here. Revisional visual politic, and we would love to know what you think. We'll be able to leave poverty behind and become an economic powerhouse and his Kosinski the ideal person to achieve this.
