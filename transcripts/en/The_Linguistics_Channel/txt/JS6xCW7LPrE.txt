Speaker 1:          00:00          Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thou. We've all read Shakespeare in school and for many there enough vowels, these dyes and dies to make their heads hurt, but just what are these archaic pronouns does seem to have bill place in modern society. Today we're going to talk about val, the Di and dine, why you is used as a subject pronoun in the plural and the singular and how all of this has affected how we speak. But first a brief English history lesson. Old English, the predecessor to our modern variety. It was spoken from four 58 D to 10 66 80 and resembled German. This is because English and German share a common ancestor. They can bolt trace their lineage through the Germanic Klein, but they developed independently English being highly influenced by French and Latin among other languages that change. The middle English has said specifically at 10 66 80 because this year marks the Norman conquest of England, the Normans.

Speaker 1:          00:53          We're residents of northern friends who spoke a language that was a predecessor to modern French. We don't have a lot of time to go into a lot of detail. So suffice it to say that guy with a really cool sounding name really in the second Duke of Normandy or later William the conqueror defeated a guy with a lot less cool sounding name, Harold and took control of England during the Middle English period of 10 66 80 to 1458 d English underwent a lot of changes, not the least of which was the extensive barring of both French and Latin words. Early modern English spoken from 1458 d tour around the turn of the 18th century was the language of Shakespeare and the language of the King James version of the Bible and the English that we're most concerned with today. First, let's talk about pronouns. Just stay with me.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Pronouns, take the place of a noun in a sentence. And in today's English we have quite a few which can be divided into several categories. Subject pronouns like I, she and they are used as the subject of the sentence. I liked cheese, object pronouns like me, her and then our use as the object of the sentence. Cheese likes me there also reflexive pronouns like myself, herself and themselves cause that's of determiners like my, her and there and possessive pronouns like mine, hers and theirs. So what does all this have to do without the die and die in Shakespeare's English and an older forms of English as well that was used where we use the singular you in today's English you are cheese would have been rendered thou art, cheese and Shakespeare's English where thou is the subject pronouns, cheese likes. You would have been rendered cheese like if the where the is the object Pronoun, your cheese stinks would have been rendered thy cheese stinketh where thy is the possessive determiner.

Speaker 1:          02:38          It's not my cheese, it's yours would have been rendered. It's not my cheese, it's the line where the line is the possessive pronoun but there's more here than meets the eye because you also existed in Shakespeare's English as did a more curious word. Ye How do you and ye relate to bow and the four that we have to go back a little further notes to simplify things and to avoid confusion. I'm going to use modern spellings and modern pronunciation so they'll be trying to tell me that I don't know how to speak old English and middle English, which you know I don't in early middle English and in modern English that was used exclusively to refer to an individual in this second person. If I were to talk to my friend, I would say thou art my friend. The was used exclusively as the second person, singular object Pronoun I love Thee.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Ye on the other hand was used exclusively to address multiple people in the second person. Ye are my friends. You was used exclusively as the second person, plural, object Pronoun. I love you. You meaning I love you all or I love you guys. You in the plural. It was in middle English through French influence that English speakers first started to use ie to not only refer it to a group of people but to also refer to an individual in a more formal manner. To show respect. It was originally something that you'd say to your king, you are very wise, your majesty or in modern English you are all very wise. Your Majesty kind of like you're so great that you must be better than just one individual person. You was later used to respectfully address any superior person. Speakers of French will know that Wgu is a formal way to address an individual and then it's also used to address a group of people, but they may not know that who used to be used exclusively to address multiple people.

Speaker 1:          04:26          So when Shakespeare's Day you'd use vow with your buddies or anyone inferior to you and he with superior individuals or when addressing multiple people. So why did we stop using ye as a subject pronouns and start using you for both the subject pronouns and the object or ma'am, basically bad grammar. Instead of saying you are my friends or a year my king and using the subject from them, people started saying you are my friends or you are my king using the object Pronoun in place at the subject pronouns. How could this happen? It doesn't make any sense. Well one ye and you sound quite a bit of like especially in casual speech and to actually, this is quite a bit like how many use me as a subject pronoun in modern English in certain contexts. Some say Jim and me went to the store instead of Jim and I went to the store replacing the subject pronoun with an object Pronoun throughout early modern English III and you are used interchangeably as subject pronouns, but eventually you one out becoming the subject Pronoun and remaining the object Pronoun for both individuals and groups as early modern English developed into the English of today, you began to be used more commonly to address just anyone and thou the dye and dine died out in most contexts.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Understandably you becoming the second person singular subject Pronoun gave rise to you all y'all, you guys and the like because we needed a way to differentiate between individuals and groups. Who knows, maybe we'll continue on its present course ended a few hundred years. We'll be using me as a subject program and then just about any case until next time me like cheese.
