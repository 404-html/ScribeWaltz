Speaker 1:          00:00          Literally in a literal, exact or actual sense, not figuratively or allegorically. The primary definition of the word literally literally used to indicate that some metaphorical or hyperbolic will expression is to be taken in the strongest, admissible since virtually or figuratively. Second definition of the word literally. And it's that second definition that grammar prescriptive is seemed to be uncomfortable with. So in defense of that second definition, meaning figuratively or virtually allow me to present a case for literally the first argument of the prosecution states. But isn't it impossible for literally to retain its original meaning so long it is being used to express the opposing idea and won't having two opposing definitions caused confusion. Actually, English has quite a few words that simultaneously cold what meaning and its polar opposite. They're called Auto Antonyms or conference. For example, I can cleave a tree in two with my ax or as genesis suggests I can cleave unto my wife.

Speaker 1:          01:02          One definition means to divide while the other definition means to bring together, despite having one word with two opposing definitions. Both definitions have remained intact and given the fact that context among other things helps to determine meaning and the beauty and confusion are unlikely. I submit that literally like many other auto antonyms such as dusting the furniture by removing dust, but dusting a cake by adding dust can maintain both definitions while still maintaining low levels of ambiguity. The second argument of the prosecution states that the original definition of the word literally is in an actual sense and therefore if you use it in any other way, you're using it wrong. First of all, we're definitions are constantly changing. It's a part of language and it's a part of life. The word meats, for example, did not always refer to this flesh of animals. It used to be a general word to describe any edible non liquid substance much in the same way we use the word food today.

Speaker 1:          02:03          It's true that the original definition of the word means actually, but the other definition of the word used as an intensifier, which we'll talk about later, is used in figurative situations. And as much as a handful of snooty grammar prescriptive, this would like to have control over how people speak. It is in fact the masses, not the pretentious few who ended up deciding the fate of a language. I submit that even if the dictionary did not include this second definition, which it does literally have more than one valid definition because we as a people have given it more than one. So while the original meaning of literally is in an actual sense of the word, has since broken out of that original meaning literally can now mean figuratively and it's commonly employed, has an intensifier and intensifiers a word that has little semantic content of his own, but as used to intensify the meaning of a word or phrase, which it modifies.

Speaker 1:          02:59          A couple of examples of intensifiers are so as an I'm so tired and dead as in your dead wrong, very agreeably are also intensifiers. But unlike so in dead very and really have quite a bit in common with literally vary from the England Norman [inaudible] with the modern French word for play used to have the meaning of truly or actually and really coming from the word real had a similar meeting. Now both words are often just use as intensifiers although the original meanings of the words are still employed in some context. When do you say, I'm really excited. You don't mean that in all reality or truthfulness you are excited. You mean my level of excitement surpasses that of just being plain excited. I'm really excited. I submit that literally is taking, it's rightly deserve place as an intensifier in the English language and it cannot be judged based solely on its original meaning and the final argument of the prosecution states. This is just a modern corruption of the English language. I guess everything is relative but considering the fact that using literally in a non literal sense has been around for longer than the United States itself. I wouldn't necessarily call this a modern corruption and tell next time. I'm literally going to bite the head off of the next person that says, I'm using literally wrong. Um, well, I think that was, come on.
