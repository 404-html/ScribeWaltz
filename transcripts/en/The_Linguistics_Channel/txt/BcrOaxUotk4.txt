Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi, welcome to this week's video. Today we're going to be talking about effect and effect and when to use each one no to both words are pronounced pretty similarly and therefore the distinguished them. I'm going to pronounce them a effect and effect. When I was in the eighth grade, I had an English teacher named Mrs Christianson who would try to get us to learn from our mistakes by making us do a project that would demonstrate that we had learned the correct principle for whatever grammar rule we had viciously though around and very much figuratively slaughtered and apparently died, totally misused, a effect and effect of the paper. So then I went home and I asked for my dad's helping, thinking of some idea to put on a poster and he greatly influenced my idea of drawing some pictures of some rainy scenes and then riding in my crappy eighth grade handwriting.

Speaker 1:          00:47          The rain in Spain affects the plane and the effect of the rain is a soggy plane, probably because he had just watched my fair lady. Honestly, I still didn't fully understand the difference between a fact and effect, but I submitted the poster and I moved on with my life. So without further ado, any effect is a verb and it means to have an influence on it can also be technically used as a noun, but most of the time you're going to see it as a verb. So in the example given earlier the subject, in this case, the rain doesn't action to the direct object. In this case, the plane, that action is offense, the rain affects or has an influence on the plane effect. On the other hand is usually announced in effect is basically something that was brought at bat or a result in the example given earlier.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Effect is a noun and the subject of the sentence and the rest of the sentence simply describes what the effect of the rain was on the plane. Essentially, it caused it to be soggy. In this example, the dog's heartfelt ballad affected me deeply. We use a effect because we needed a verb that meant to have an influence on the dog's ballad influenced me in some way. It affected me, but in this example, the effect of the dog's ballad on the cat was a brutal one. We use effect because we needed announced that meant result. We could've just as easily said, the result of the dog's ballad on the cat was a brutal one. Yes, effect can be used as a bird, though it's far less common. When he effect is used as a verb. It means to bring about something you will often hear effect as a verb in the phrase effect, a change, which means to bring about a change. As in the phrase we need to effect a change in the world. Basically, if you just remember that a defect is a verb and effect is a noun, you'll be right most of the time. Until next time, go watch my fair lady. It's a classic.
