Speaker 1:          00:00          Oranges or in soda or a sickles orange roles. We're surrounded by oranges. They're in our bathrooms, in our kitchens and even on our clothes and as a color, they're founded even more places. In fact, if I didn't look so bad in orange, I probably be wearing an orange shirt right now, but what are the origins of the word orange? The word originally comes from the Dravidian peoples of ancient India. It was later borrowed into Sanskrit as Nevada and then the fruit and the word made its way into Persia. After that, it worked it's way farther west into the Arabic speaking countries where it was known as not Onj. Spanish speakers may recognize this as a cognate with the Spanish word not on and the early 1300 Arab traders brought a bitter orange later known as the Seville orange from the Middle East to Sicily and the fruit quickly spread throughout the rest of Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:55          It was in Italian and French that the word originally lost its initial end sound through a process known as the med analysis or re bracketing Italians indefinite article ending with the same sounds as the first two letters of the word not on absorb the initial end sound. Nina not ONJ became, Ooh, not on chef. And even more understandably when the French bottle, the word into their language, the boundary between the article and the word not ONJ became all too unclear. You know, home became, you know, home. They're pretty much pronounced exactly the same. The process is called re bracketing precisely because the word boundaries are changed. They're re bracketed there redefined where once the boundary between words existed here, it was later put here to give you a better idea of just how easy this is to happen, especially in a world where coming across the word and writing would have been exceedingly more rare.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Try saying the following, an orange and orange, they're pronounced almost exactly the same and careful speech and exactly the same in casual speech. So when the French began to use this new and exotic word, primarily in speech, some new, they were saying in the home, but others heard it as you know, honk. And it's here when the word enters the English language by a French as an orange. It was later in the 16th century when the word had already spread throughout all of Europe. That the sweet orange, the orange we know and love today was brought from China to Europe by Portuguese merchants and later to the Americas by the Spanish. It is also around this time when we begin to see the word used to describe the color and tell next time, orange, you glad I didn't tell a cheesy joke about oranges.
