Speaker 1:          00:00          As you all know intuitively whether or not you've actually thought about it. Language is made up of individual sounds that when combined together give us the words that we use in speech. The scientific study of these sounds is called phonetics. When we understand the language, we can distinguish between the sounds that exist in that language combined sounds together to form words and understand others when they combine sounds together to form words at their own. But when you hear someone talking in a language that you know next to nothing about the individual sounds strung together, don't form words in your ears. They're perceived as generous because of the inherent knowledge that we have of the sound system that exists in our native language and the knowledge that we have of the written language that we've learned through study. Generally speaking, we know how a word ought to be pronounced just by looking at it, even though in some languages, English among them, the combination of letters in a word doesn't necessarily suggest how to pronounce it. For example, a native speaker knows that doubt is pronounced doubt, not doubt, but that kernel is pronounced colonel, not colo now and that no and know are pronounced exactly the same. This inconsistency between spelling and pronunciation has been famously illustrated by this word often attributed to George Bernard Shaw. Though its origins seems unclear, which spells fish using the g h as in tough, the o as in women and the TCI as in nation. Also potato.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Yeah, but although we do know how to pronounce many words by sight, what about words we've never pronounced out loud before? What about words in other languages? Who's spellings and pronunciations are unclear to us for that we have the IPA. IPA stands for international phonetic alphabet and unlike other reselling systems that only worked for native speakers, Dick Shun Narr re the IPA include standardized phonetic representations for every sound that exists in every known language. The international phonetic alphabet offers a letter or symbol that corresponds to every individual sound that exists in the languages of the world. This makes learning the IPA extremely useful indeed prerequisite for anyone who's interested in the serious study of language. To start off, it's best to familiarize yourself with the sounds that exist in your own language. So today I will be presenting you with the IPA symbols and their corresponding towns for the consonants in the English language.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Uh, constantly is formed when in some way we restrict the passage of air through the vocal track by, among other things, the moving or contorting of our lips and tones. All consonant sounds are classified according to three basic criteria, place of articulation, which refers to where the sound is produced in the mouth, manner of articulation, which refers to how the sound is produced in the mouth and voicing, which tells you whether or not the sound is produced with the vibration of the vocal chords. In this, this episode I will describe the consonant sounds according to their place of articulation. You'll have to wait until part two to hear about how the sounds are classified according to the other two criteria. As I present the different places of articulation, I'll also placed on the screen the IPA symbol that corresponds to each of the consonants that are made at each place of articulation.

Speaker 2:          03:32          The sounds that I will be producing here will be shown using the IPA symbol between two slashes on the screen. The slashes indicate that at phone nemic transcription is being used. Don't worry too much about the terminology now in future videos I'll go into greater depth on this subject.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Here we go. A bilabial is a sound produced using bold lips by meaning two and Lavey over referring to the lip and English. There are three as in buckle as in potato and ma as in muscle, a lab. You know dental is a sound that's made by touching the bottom of the upper teeth to the lower lip. In English there are two sentence made this way as in future and as in vase or vase. An interdental is this sound made by placing the tongue between the top and bottom teeth in English there are two as in think and as in those then you thought all the symbols, we're going to be easy and Alveolar is a sound that's made by touching the tip of the tongue on the alveolar ridge. That weird, hard, bumpy thing right behind the front teeth in English. There are seven sentence made.

Speaker 1:          04:54          This as in top D as in danger, no as in nothing, so as an sourcer, Z as in Zombie, look as in lake and rough in retro note. The official sound for the right side up are is as in the Spanish word Pero Pero Kalyan although the upside down our is the official symbol for the r sound in English. Sometimes we cooperate to the right side up our for transcription. It is very common to do this so keep an eye out for it. A post lb layer is a sound that's produced by placing the tip of the tongue just behind the alveolar ridge and sort of bunching up the tongue behind it. These sounds are generally considered partially palatalized because they share some characteristics with the pellet holes which we'll discuss in a moment. In English there are four post lb there, consonants, cheap as in cheese, J as in jeep, she as in sheep and as an measure or when doing transcription in English.

Speaker 1:          06:12          Sometimes these other symbols are used in place of the ones that I showed you so keep an eye out for that as well. A palatal is a sound that's made by bringing the center of the tongue up to the hard palate, the hard part of the roof of your mouth located just behind the Alveolar Ridge in English. There is only one true palatal yet as in you, uh, Vilar is a sound that's produced by bringing the back of the tongue up to the soft palate, the soft part of the roof of the mouth, also known as the Villum in English. There are three sounds made this way as in key. Good as in good and isn't seen. Note this sound is a curious one in English and really only occurs at the end of a word. In the example given earlier, some may think that they pronounced the gut at the end of seeing and some may in fact pronounce it, but it's far more common to hear the Vilar that we've already mentioned.

Speaker 1:          07:16          It's far more common to hear seeing instead of seeing good. Generally the only time you'll ever hear seeing good is if someone's over annunciating. As in the following example, I think we need to sing a duet with what do you think we need to do? Seeing a duet, a glottal was a sound that's produced by the passing of air through the open Gladys in this part of the neck as in house. I know what you're thinking. What about the w? The sound as in water is a co articulated consonant, meaning that it's produced at two places of articulation. It's a bilabial because it's produced with both lips and a Vilar because of the position of the tongue. For that reason, it defies easy classification and is sometimes known as a lady. Oh, Vilar. Well, there you have it. All of the consonants classified according to their place of articulation. Stay tuned for part two where we will discuss the other two criteria that help us classify these consonants. Sounds.
