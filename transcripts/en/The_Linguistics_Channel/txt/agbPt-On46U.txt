Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi and welcome to this week's grammar spotlight. Today we're going to talk about less and fewer and when to use each one, but in order to do that and we have to talk about the nails that less and fewer modify all nouns can be divided into two categories and no, we're not talking about proper nouns and common nouns. We're talking about countdowns and mass nouns or non countdowns as their name might suggest. Countdowns are countable. They can be pluralized by adding s and they can take the indefinite article a for example, houses account down because I can count it pluralize it and use a before it for countdowns. Fewer as used. Thus I have fewer houses, fewer monkeys and 10 items or fewer wait bass nailed or non count. Nouns are nouns that cannot be divided into countable units such as information. Information cannot be counted, cannot be pluralized by adding this and cannot be used with a, thus I have less information, less homework and less furniture, not fewer information's fewer homeworks and fewer furnitures, but be careful because there are words that can be used as both countdowns and mass nouns.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Self for example, is normally used as a mass known. There is less salt on the food than the table, but in chemistry I might have fewer salts than I'm accustomed to and now the exceptions. What good would the rule be without exceptions? Less is often used in place of fewer with dealing with expressions of measurement and time, so I make less than $12 an hour and their child is less than two years old. While there are some exceptions, keeping in mind the general rule of fewer for countdowns and less for non count downs, we'll give you a lot less heartache. And in case you were wondering, yes, this is a prescriptive rule. Let's use to be considered perfectly adequate for countdowns and mass nouns. The injury for less than the Oxford English dictionary shows that as far back as eight 88 eight d when we were still speaking old English, Lex was used with countdowns as well, but that isn't the only example that Oxford lists John Lilly and early modern English rider of the 16th century wrote the following in his book, the Anatomy of wit. I think there are a few universities that have less false than Oxford. Many that have more and yes, those these in use and that the, in our written correctly, at least for 16th century English. Until next time, I hope you have less Sar when fewer troubles than usual this week or else fewer sorrows in less trouble. Both that usual, as I said, some downs are both countdowns and on countdowns.
