Speaker 1:          00:00          Here's a question for you. Is using proper grammar important? The answer is yes and no. In fact, the correct answer is probably, it depends. Let me explain. In linguistics, grammar is generally defined, has a knowledge of the system of rules implicit in a language that exists in the mind of a speaker, which includes rules for phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. But when we try to take that knowledge out of the mine of the speaker and write it down, one is produce can be described in three ways. Descriptive grinders attempt to describe the rules that exist in the minds of the speakers and do not attempt to tell you how you should speak. Prescriptive grammars attempt to prescribe certain rules of grammar and do tell you how you should speak. Teaching grammars are generally used in schools and are used to teach students a standard dialect of the language, whether or not their native speakers of that language.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Today, we're mainly going to talk about prescriptive grammars for the sake of this study, let's look at the word important in two different ways as we attempt to answer the following questions. One is using proper grammar important as it relates to the purpose of language that is done using proper grammar. Help us to exchange ideas between two groups of people and if so, can using improper grammar be equally as successful too? Is using proper grammar socially important? That is is using proper grammar important to us as a society? Whether or not it aids in communication? If so, should it be important first or we're not prescriptive. This grammar prescriptive, this, I'm more concerned about the social importance of grammar. They're not interested in whether a rule of grammar helps or hinders communication. They're more interested in whether or not their language and the language of others is correct.

Speaker 1:          01:49          That it's held to the highest standard even when many times that standard is based on an arbitrary set of rules and governed by the pretentious elites of society. In other words, grammar is important to them just because they see everything as right or wrong. If it was correct or standard grammar, you're seen as better than others, not necessarily because you communicate more clearly, but because you do things in the proper way. If you use bad or substitute or grammar, you're seen as wrong. Whether or not you communicated your idea clearly to the other party prescriptive. This can include those who consider themselves grammar Nazis who are constantly correcting the grammar and pronunciation of those around them who cringe when they hear someone misuse who and Kuhn. They are those who cry out against the decay of grammar and the corruption of the English language. Interestingly enough, crying out against the corruption of language is not at all a new invention.

Speaker 1:          02:37          It's been going on for centuries. One might even assume it's been going on since the beginning of humankind itself over 250 years ago. Bishop Robert Loud of thing, grammar prescriptive this of the 18th century wrote down his series of arbitrary rules designed to prescribe how both of the upperclass should speak is from that we get sucked rules as two negatives make a positive and one was never end the sentence with a preposition besides being based on his personal preferences. The other problem with many of his rules is that there were based on the grammar of Latin and made little real sense in English, Winston Churchill even famously mocked that never end a sentence with a preposition role by saying this is the sort of nonsense up with which I will not put what Louth and many other grammar prescriptive is failed to realize is that languages are constantly changing and that language change or for that matter, language variation does not equate with language corruption.

Speaker 1:          03:33          So while today, some idealized the English of yesterday, they should keep in mind that many people who spoke the English of yesterday still found fault in it. The truth is English is no better or worse than it used to be. It's just different. So is using proper grammar important as it relates to the purpose of language? Yes and no. Many of our grammar rules do serve a purpose as it relates to communicating clearly. And not all grammar rules are prescriptive. Knowledge of word order, for example, is very important for communicating clearly. And many times is not prescriptive. Dad be a new pair of shoes bought. Might be understandable, but it's a lot less clear than dad bought me a new pair of shoes yet I'm not being a grammar prescriptive based. When I tell you that you should use this second sentence and not the first.

Speaker 1:          04:18          In order for this to be a prescriptive, this rule, both sentences would have to be things that people actually say and both would have to communicate the same idea clearly. But if I were to say Jibo, he went to the store and you said actually it's Jim and I went to the store. That would be an example of prescriptive ism. Why? Because of the like are examples of variations that exist in the language and both communicate the same idea. Clearly I'm not at all confused about who, when, where. So using proper grammar can be important as it relates to the exchange of ideas, but that doesn't mean that by using improper grammar, I can't communicate this same idea just as clearly as long as what I say he is clearly understood. It makes no difference how I say tomato, tomato. If I use whom where I use me and I or whether or not I use less and fewer correctly in proper grammar can be just as important, just as useful at communicating ideas.

Speaker 1:          05:16          So is using proper grammar socially important? Yes. Using proper grammar may not always be important as it relates to clearly communicating ideas, but it is important because we've made it important. Kind of like twilight is not important as it relates to literature. It's only important because we made it so yeah, we did. As a society, we've made using proper grammar important, especially in formal situations. If you misuse their, they're on a resume, say light too many times in a job interview or confused, APEC did effect in an essay, chances aren't going to be looked down on. You'll appear uneducated lower class or even downright stupid. Even though knowing all the rules of a standard grammar doesn't necessarily make you a better communicator. Unfortunately, looking down on others for how they use language is often socially important in informal situations as well. No one should have to be judged by their friends and informal conversation.

Speaker 1:          06:14          No one should be chastised for typing. See you tonight. Did a text message without a period or for misspelling. A word in the comment section of a youtube video so long is that misspelling doesn't cause confusion. Informal situation should allow people to relax, be friends, communicate clearly and openly, rounds more formal situations often require a more standardized dialect and grammar. Why? Just because it shouldn't be this way, in my opinion. No. As long as you could communicate with me clearly, I don't care how many grammar mistakes you make besides variation is beautiful and it makes linguistics that much more interesting. So next time you're tempted to look down on someone because of a grammar mistake, ask yourself the following, did I clearly understand what he or she meant? If so, but it go, here's a, her dialect may deviate from the standard, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Until next time, I wonder if capable in her mind and Kate met Ron ever got together, or if a hurricane might intercepted.
