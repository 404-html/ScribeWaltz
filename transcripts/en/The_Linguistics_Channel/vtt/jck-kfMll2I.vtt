00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.530
Let's take a moment to think about janitors.
Dirty,
stinky,

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.640
backbreaking work,
low pay,
low class,
low self esteem.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.540
At least that's the image that many people have about this underpaid,

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.060
underappreciated segment of society.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.320
But what are the origins of the word janitor of words?

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.920
Etymology as a history of its origin and usage.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.870
Not to be confused with entomology,
the study of ents and insects,

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.110
the word gender traces its roots back to the Latin word,

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.300
young wa the work for door.

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.860
And that combined with the agenda of suffix tour gives us our modern word

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.820
janitor.

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.820
But what is an agenda of subjects and agenda of suffix is a suffix such as er,

13
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:49.101
oh are Ian or ist added to the end of a verb or now that changes it into a new

14
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:54.861
noun and essentially adds the meaning of someone or something that does whatever

15
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:57.420
the original work describes to work,

16
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.700
to exert oneself physically or mentally to do,

17
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.580
make or accomplish something becomes worker.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.220
Someone who works piano.

19
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.070
A musical instrument becomes pianist,

20
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.480
someone who plays the piano.
So one of our Latin word for door.

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.770
When we take yen Wa Adore and act with the agenda of suffix tour,

22
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.360
we get a keeper of a door,
a guardian of a door.

23
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.770
Thus the original janitors had nothing to do with cleaning and everything to do

24
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.350
with the holding of keys and the keeping of doors.

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.730
The Romans who spoke Latin names one of their gods using the same group word for

26
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:36.390
door and Roman mythology,
demos with the god of beginnings,

27
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.920
endings and transitions,

28
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.390
and thus the god of doors and gateways because of his role as the guardian of

29
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.740
inferences and exits,

30
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.910
Jan is often pictured with two heads looking for ever into the past and the

31
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.720
future.
So yeah,
a pretty cool God.

32
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.150
It just for 10 years that we get the month of January,

33
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.960
the first month in the Julian and Gregorian calendar's and the first month of

34
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:00.150
the modern calendar name for Jim's.

35
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.320
Precisely because it is the beginning or infants of the year.

36
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.040
And if that's not enough,
one of Saturn's moons is named Ppar Gamma who says,

37
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:12.600
well,
so as we can see,
the word janitor was not at all a negative thing.

38
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.160
Saint Peter is even described in some texts as the janitor of heaven.

39
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.030
So why then have we come to look on the word janitor with disdain?

40
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.140
Precisely because language changes and in this case that were gender under went

41
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:29.390
to some men take change of meaning change through our process.
No Ms. Page,

42
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.160
aeration page,

43
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.080
or Richard is a process by which a word's meaning degrades or becomes more

44
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:35.940
negative.
For example,
the word Pagan,

45
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:40.410
which now refers to an uncivilized barbarous unchristian person,

46
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.510
has changed drastically from its original meaning of country dweller as
janitors,

47
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:49.950
who originally just acted as storekeepers and key holders naturally began to

48
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.860
take on the other aspects of a buildings maintenance.

49
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.430
The word acquired a more negative meaning.
Now,

50
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:00.970
it's hard to imagine a janitor without a toilet.
In our mental image,

51
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.860
though some may look down on janitors,

52
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.861
they certainly find themselves in good company among God's saints and Heavenly

53
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.090
bodies.
Until next time,

54
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:14.230
remember that although janitors might not hold the keys to the beginnings and

55
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:18.730
endings of time,
they do hold the keys to your office.
