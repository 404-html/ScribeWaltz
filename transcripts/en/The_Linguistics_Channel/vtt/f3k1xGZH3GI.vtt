Hi.
On this week's grimmer spotlight,

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.380
we're going to talk about the difference between two commonly misused verbs lay

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.190
and why.
Before we get into the details of lay and lie,

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.510
let's do a quick review of verb transitivity.
Generally speaking,

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:20.280
birds are divided into two categories.
Transitive,
intransitive,

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.070
all verbs express an action of some kind,

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.930
but only transitive verbs transfer that action to a direct object and when

8
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:32.250
trends and adverbs are used without a direct object,
they sound incomplete.

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.080
For example,
by as a transitive verb,
it transfers its action to an object.

10
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:41.850
When used in a sentence,
the doctor bought a new car.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.670
In this sentence,
the doctor is the subject,

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.900
she is performing the action of buying and that action is transferred to a

13
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:52.230
direct object.
In this case,
the car,
the Berg,

14
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:57.080
Bob takes the direct object and thus is a transitive verb.
Also,

15
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.340
you can tell that by is a transitive verb.

16
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.150
By removing the direct object from the sentence and seeing how it sounds,

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.510
the doctor Bhat,
it sounds incomplete.

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Those we know that by is a transitive verb and needs a direct object in order to

19
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.700
be complete.
Intransitive verbs on the other hand,

20
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:19.410
do not require a direct object in order to complete their sentence.
For example,

21
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.280
laugh is an intransitive burb I laughed heartedly.

22
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.640
I am the subject of the sentence.
Laughs is the verb,

23
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.740
but there is no direct object.

24
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.450
I cannot say I laughed the joke but wait,
you might be saying,

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.910
I can say I laughed at the joke.

26
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.890
Wouldn't add the joke be the direct object in this case.
No it isn't.

27
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.580
Why?
Because at the joke is really just a propositional phrase.

28
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.730
Where at is the preposition and joke is the object of the preposition.

29
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.820
In this case you can think of the propositional phrase at the joke as a phrase

30
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:57.810
that gives you more information about the circumstances at the laughing or how

31
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:02.250
the lapping was carried out,
but do not confuse it with the direct object.

32
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.400
But what does all this have to do with lay and lie lady as a transitive verb,

33
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:10.720
which means it requires a direct object in order to complete it.

34
00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:14.730
Since I lay the pencil on the table,

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.750
I lay the cat in her cat hammock.

36
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.850
Lie is an intransitive verb,

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.950
which means it doesn't require a direct object in order to complete its,

38
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:28.050
since I need to go lie down.

39
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.420
So what's the big confusion?

40
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.960
The main confusion comes when you get out of the present tense.

41
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.160
The past tense of lie is in fact lay.

42
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.150
Yeah.
So today I need to lie down,

43
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:47.151
but yesterday I lay in bed all day and in case you need to do a compound tense,

44
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:50.550
the past partless love beloved lie is lane.

45
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.440
So I had laid in bed for just two hours before the picker boy came and the

46
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.720
progressive form is lying.

47
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.940
So I been lying here all day.

48
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.570
The past tense of lay on the other hand is laid.

49
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.630
So today I lay the pencil on the table,

50
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.990
but yesterday I laid the pencil on the table.

51
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.260
The past participle of lay is also laid.

52
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.430
So I had just laid the pencil on the table when you walked in.

53
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.230
The progressive form is lane.

54
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.280
So I haven't been laying pencils on this table all day.

55
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.220
So all you about to remember is lay laid,
laid.

56
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:31.840
His transitive and lie lay lane is intransitive.

57
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.281
Also,

58
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:37.420
it might help if you just sit there repeating them for awhile until next time.

59
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.270
Lay laid,
laid lie lane,
Lane Lane,

60
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:46.750
laid laid lie lane,
lane lay,
lay,

61
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.800
lay lie lane lane lay led,

62
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.380
led lie lay lane.
