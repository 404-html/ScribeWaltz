00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.570
Someone once told me that there was no way to justify the use of,

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:07.140
I could care less and we're light years to agree with that rather brash,

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:11.160
narrow minded view of this particular language oddity.
I have a sense repented,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.450
so without further ado,
allow me to present a case for I could care less.

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.030
The first argument of the prosecution states saying I could care less doesn't

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.630
make sense.
Logically,

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.930
if you mean I don't care at all than it is logically incorrect to say I could

8
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:31.650
care less,
which would imply that you at least care somewhat.

9
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.180
In order to prove this argument,

10
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.870
you wouldn't have to approve that they English language must always make sense

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.820
and that there is no room in English.

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850
Four phrases that do not make sense and that would be impossible to prove.

13
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.670
An idiomatic expression is by definition an expression whose meaning cannot be

14
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:54.740
inferred by the definitions of the words that make it up or in simpler terms.

15
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.740
An idiomatic expression is an expression that doesn't make sense literally and

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.490
English is full of them.
For example,

17
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.240
to pull someone's leg doesn't mean you're going to physically grab someone's leg

18
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:06.870
and pull it.

19
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.380
Even though the combination of the meetings of all the words in the phrase would

20
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:14.340
suggest just such an action in a native speaker of English would tell you that

21
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:19.020
to pull someone's leg means to trick or deceive someone in a playful way.

22
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.340
A definition that is not at all based on the definitions of the words that

23
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:26.940
comprise the phrase itself.
If someone gets cold feet before a wedding,

24
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.090
you don't buy them a pair of socks.
If a decision is up in the air,

25
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.690
you don't wait for it to Nepal.
If someone has been in your head off,

26
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
there's no need to go to a doctor to have him sew it back on again.

27
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.510
Languages are full of idiomatic expressions and it's precisely the wealth of

28
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.190
thematic expressions that in any given language then they've been so hard for

29
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:49.050
non native speakers to learn.

30
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.100
I submit that I could care less as an idiomatic expression like any other,

31
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.120
which doesn't have to make sense in order for it to be a valid way to express an

32
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:57.930
idea.

33
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.070
So long as the other speakers of the language understand the meaning and upset

34
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:06.450
expression,
which brings me to the second argument of the prosecution using,

35
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:10.260
I could care less to mean that you don't care at all causes confusion.

36
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.920
While this argument does have some validity because idiomatic expressions must

37
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:17.490
be understood by the speakers of the language and must be something that native

38
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:19.050
speakers to actually say,

39
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.170
I have never ever misunderstood someone when he or she says I could care less

40
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.260
and I submit that all the English prescriptive that's out there have never

41
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:30.150
misunderstood it as well.

42
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.230
It is precisely because they do understand what someone means that they're so

43
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:37.350
annoyed when someone gets it wrong.
When we speak.

44
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.620
We don't rely solely on the definitions of the words in a sentence and how they

45
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:43.620
relate to each other in order to extract meaning.

46
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.110
We use the tone of the speaker of his or her body language,

47
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:49.530
and not to mention the context of the conversation along with an internal

48
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:53.490
knowledge of the rules and exceptions of grammar and an incredible memory,

49
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:58.491
Bank of idiomatic expressions in order to understand someone's utterance.

50
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.220
And we generally accept that any given utterance need not be logical in order to

51
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:07.150
be understood.
And now the final argument of the prosecution,

52
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.450
it's wrong,
it's just wrong.

53
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.620
Just check out my video on prescriptive ism.
Until next time,

54
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.170
I couldn't care less that you can tear less.
