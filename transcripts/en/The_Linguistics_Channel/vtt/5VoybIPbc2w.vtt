00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.760
What do Maria,
the first of Portugal,
King Charles,

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:06.990
the sixth of friends and colleagues you love Rome all have in common besides

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:10.680
being,
you know,
rulers.
They were all pretty much crazy.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.830
King Charles the six for example,
thought that he was made of glass.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.671
Caligula Rome,

6
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:18.180
let's commanded his guards to throw on large section of the arena spectators

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:20.850
into the lion's pit because he got bored.
And Maria,

8
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:24.660
the first in later life Corinda thought she was being chased by devils.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.420
But what are the origins of the word?
Crazy.

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.290
Crazy is at an illogical route.
Seems somewhat unclear,

11
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:35.520
but I likely origin comes from the old French word [inaudible] itself,

12
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.900
a borrowing from old Norse [inaudible] who's modern form and cause a like the

13
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:43.020
older form means to break shattered or crushed or cracked,

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.560
made its way into middle English as a craze.

15
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.850
Then through a process called [inaudible] cysts that were lost.
Its initial a,

16
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.630
a Ferris's simply refers to the loss of one or more sounds at the beginning of a

17
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:58.140
word,
especially in the case of unstressed vowels.

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.190
Given the fact that the craze part,
the word,
a craze forms the stressed syllable,

19
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.730
the unstressed syllable a dropped off in casual speech,

20
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.050
a craze became craze to understand how this could happen.

21
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.120
Try saying the following several times quickly,
I'm going to a crazy,

22
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.640
I'm going to crazy you.
I'm going to craze you.
I'm going to craze you.

23
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.860
I'm going to crazy.
You see what I mean?

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.670
But the evas version of the word was a verb and it wasn't until around the end

25
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.300
of the 16th century that we begin to see the word crop up as a noun as well.

26
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.130
And this new noun form pronounced the same as the verb referred to a breach

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.800
crack or flaw.
Around that same time,

28
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.040
cray started to be used as an adjective as well with the addition of the

29
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:39.210
derivational subjects.

30
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.680
Why which added the meaning of having the qualities of and thus having the

31
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:48.300
qualities of a breach or crack or full of cracks was the original meaning of the

32
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:50.580
modern English word crazy,

33
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.060
which was used to as fried objects such as buildings are shifts that were

34
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:58.830
cracked,
broken down,
shaky or unsound.
Shortly thereafter,

35
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.510
we started to use the word to describe people who were of an unsound or cracked

36
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.630
mine.
In other words,
insane people.

37
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.690
So although we don't often think about the origins of the word crazy,

38
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:14.310
it actually has a lot in common with another idiom for an insane person cracked

39
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.360
as in the phrase,
I think he's finally cracked.
Ah.

40
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.380
So that's how crazy took his place to become one of the most common words for an

41
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.250
insane person.

42
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.080
Surpassing even more modern words such as nuts and bananas,

43
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.850
but crazy hasn't stopped there.

44
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:32.850
And that is taken on even more meetings throughout the years.

45
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.300
I can be crazy for a girl like one hit wonders,
Evan and Jared,

46
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:39.000
which means I'm in moderately infatuated with her.

47
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.110
I can be crazy about star wars,
suggesting that I'm obsessed with it though.

48
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:47.000
Still quite sane.
So,
uh,
who's your favorite Jetta?
I,

49
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.330
I prefer the more obscure jet.
I like the hot,

50
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.000
and I can say that was a crazy dream,

51
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.850
which could suggest that my dream had elements of insanity,

52
00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:01.851
but most likely means that I had a or strange dream and it can be used.

53
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.810
And even more situations like in crazy bread,

54
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.170
which I just think means surprisingly delicious bread.

55
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.160
Until next time I'm going to go back in time and watch King Charles think he's

56
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.500
glass.
Did that sound too crazy?
