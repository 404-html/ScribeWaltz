00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.170
Hi.
Welcome to this week's episode.
Today we're going to talk about more fallen

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.400
<v 1>linguistics.</v>

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.330
<v 0>Morphology is a branch of linguistics that deals with the structure and form of</v>

4
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:19.331
the words in a language and all words can be divided into two categories,

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.100
content,
words and function words.

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.130
Content words are words that have a clear lexical,

7
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:28.610
meaning these classes composed of nouns,
verbs,

8
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:33.020
adjectives and adverbs,
their words for people,
things,
actions,

9
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.730
ideas and attributes.

10
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.760
Content words are considered an open class because new words can be added and

11
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.480
indeed are added to this category due to changes in technology.

12
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.840
We've added words such as dumb phone and blog changing.

13
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.540
Fashion trends have given us shootings and jeggings.

14
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.590
We got a new words to describe food and food eaters such as freaking food or

15
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:56.660
locavore.

16
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.660
Social media has given us words such as friend and tweaks and the list could go

17
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:06.650
on function where it's,
on the other hand,
do not have a clear lexical meaning,

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.680
but do serve a functional purpose in a language.

19
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.450
These are words such as conjunctions articles,
prepositions,
and pronouns.

20
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.950
Function.
Words are considered a closed class because generally speaking,

21
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:21.470
we do not make additions to this category.

22
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.180
When was the last time you've seen a new preposition?
Words are all around us.

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.920
We write them,
we speak.
Then we think them.
Some words are made up of one piece,

24
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.660
but many other words are made up of more than one piece,
more than one component,

25
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.230
and these components are called morphemes.

26
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.140
A morpheme is a minimal unit of meaning,

27
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.930
so while some words can consist of one more female,

28
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.020
thus be minimal units of meaning in and of themselves.

29
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.110
Most words consist of more than one morphine.

30
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.970
The word peace has one morpheme and thus cannot be broken down into smaller

31
00:01:55.971 --> 00:02:00.380
units of meaning.
Peace full has two morphemes piece,

32
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.370
a state of harmony that exists during the absence of war plus full.

33
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.470
A suffix meaning full of something peaceful.

34
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.510
Lee has three morphemes piece plus full plus Lee because Lee in and of itself

35
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:18.881
holds the meaning of in the manner of so really peacefully contains three units

36
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:24.320
of meaning that when combined together give us the meaning of the word as a

37
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:27.650
whole.
Obviously words can have a lot more than three more PM's.

38
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.770
Antidisestablishmentarianism has a total of seven and there are words with even

39
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:34.460
more than that.

40
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.240
We should keep in mind that some morphine's can be used by themselves.

41
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.340
These are called free morphings.

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.180
They're not dependent on any other morpheme to complete their meaning.

43
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.480
Open class content words such as girl fish,

44
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:52.481
tree and love are all considered free morphemes as our close class function.

45
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:57.881
Words such as the and four or if other morphemes cannot be used by themselves

46
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.150
and dependent on other morphemes.

47
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.680
These are called bound morphemes and bell morphine's are further divided into

48
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:06.820
two categories.

49
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.350
Affixes and bound roots bound routes are routes that could not be used by

50
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.620
themselves.
For example,
see in received,

51
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:19.390
conceive and deceive cannot stand on its own.
I cannot see them.

52
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.900
Something at fixes are more things that can be added to the front of a word,

53
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.880
a prefix such as pre read this or [inaudible] to the end of a word,

54
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.870
a suffix such as an ise,
al or Lee or another lane.

55
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.500
We just do the middle of the word called [inaudible] or to both sides of the

56
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:40.501
word called circum fixes and epics is can be divided into two categories of

57
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.050
their own.
Wait,
what?
Yeah.

58
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.510
How about we take a moment to review.
First

59
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.350
morphemes are the basic units of meaning.

60
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.650
Morphemes can be divided into two classes,

61
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.260
battle more themes and free morphemes.

62
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.050
Free morphemes include open class content,

63
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:04.051
words such as cute dog run away and closed class function words such as the on

64
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.761
yet,

65
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:11.761
and he found more themes can be divided into two categories at fixes and roots

66
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.300
bound routes such as seed cannot be used by themselves.

67
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.740
Ethics is in English or the prefixes and suffixes that we add to the beginning

68
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:24.910
or ending of a word and are further divided into derivational.

69
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:27.360
Apics is and inflection and fixes

70
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.710
their emotional APICS is our APICS is that when added to a word,

71
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:36.600
create a new word with a new meaning.
They're called derivational.

72
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.350
Precisely because a new word is derived when they're added to the original word,

73
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.530
and many times these newly created words belong to a new grammatical category.

74
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.910
Some APICS is turndowns into adjectives like beauty,
too.
Beautiful.

75
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.890
Some change verbs into nouns like seeing to singer some change,

76
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.700
adjectives to adverbs,
like precise to precisely still.

77
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:05.530
Others turn nouns to verbs,
adjectives to nouns and verbs to adjectives.

78
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.520
Other affixes do not change the grammatical category of the word.

79
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:13.630
They're added to king.
Plus.
Dumb goes from noun to noun.

80
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.540
Do plus read goes from birth to verb.

81
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.580
Blue plus ish goes from adjective to adjective.
We use derivational.

82
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:25.480
Ethics is constantly and they're a very important part of English because they

83
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:30.070
help us to form the majority of words that exist in our language.

84
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.791
In English,

85
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:35.050
all of the inflectional affixes are suffixes that would add it to the end of the

86
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:39.460
word.
Don't change its meaning or at least not in any large sense.

87
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.230
Instead,
they change things like the person tents and number of a word.

88
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.220
In English,
there are a total of eight.
The third person,

89
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:52.060
singular s such as it can kills young links.

90
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.590
The past tense Ed such as Ron kissed her money.

91
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.860
The progressive ing such as Han is falling into the SARLACC pit.

92
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.010
The past participle een such as the emperor has fallen and cannot get up.

93
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.520
The plural s such as vampires make the worst boyfriends,

94
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.360
the possessive s such as,
that's Luke's hand,
isn't it?

95
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.010
The comparative Er,

96
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:21.011
such as the card is cooler than Kirk and the superman that est such as,

97
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:25.280
that's the sweetest thing I've ever seen compared to other languages.

98
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.490
English has very few inflectional affixes,

99
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.190
but they served their purpose well.
Nonetheless,

100
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.350
I realized that this is a lot of information.

101
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.250
Stay tuned for a few more videos on morphology where we'll introduce a few new

102
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:41.270
concepts and go over some of the concepts we've already covered.
How next time.
