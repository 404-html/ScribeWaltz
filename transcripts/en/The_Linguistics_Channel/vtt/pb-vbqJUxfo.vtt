00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.830
Nerds,
nerds,
nerds.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.460
Wait,
what's that?
A hipster.
Get outta here.
Hipster.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.860
What comes to your mind when you think of the word nerd?

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.490
Depending on your generation,
a nerve could be someone who is socially inept,

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.870
awkward,
unattractive,
or intelligent,
bold,

6
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.190
and even cool.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.060
The word nerd seems to have undergone a semantic change in recent years as

8
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.700
nerdiness has become part of the popular culture,

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.450
but what are the origins of the word nerd?

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.490
No one actually knows.
Wait,
what will,

11
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:35.970
but there are some theories though,

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.990
and today we're going to discuss two of the most likely origins of this very

13
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.380
peculiar word.
Though there are many other theories.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.700
Their earliest recorded use of the word as we spell it today is found in a Dr

15
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:52.230
Seuss book published in 1951 called if I ran the zoo.

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.430
The book is recorded from the perspective of Gerald McGrew who would find way

17
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.140
more exotic animals to put in the zoo if he ran it.

18
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.130
I'm one of this fanciful journeys to the land of Ca.
True.

19
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.900
Gerald tells us that he would bring back an it catch a Pre Ben approved a

20
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:10.920
knuckle,
a nerd and a seersucker to,
yeah,

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.380
a nerd looking at the illustration.

22
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:17.670
One could imagine that this little creature truly is a stereotypical nerd.

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He seemed somewhat removed and antisocial,

24
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.710
yet intelligent and given the fact that this is the first written account that

25
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.980
we have with the word,
it could be in fact be its origin.

26
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.560
There's a major flaw with this theory.
However,

27
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.430
the Oxford English dictionary listen instance of nerve found in a Newsweek

28
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.790
article dated the 8th of October,

29
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.650
1951 which states in Detroit,

30
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:45.651
someone who once would be called a drip or a square is now regrettably a nerd.

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.380
Is it possible that scarcely a year after the publication of a children's book

32
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:53.730
that offensible invention of Dr Seuss really inspired the Youth of Detroit to

33
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.940
start referring to squares as nerds?

34
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.210
Maybe though it seems somewhat unlikely.

35
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.780
Another possible origin though there seems to be little evidence to support it

36
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.820
is from a backsliding of the word drunk spelling nerd.

37
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.980
As far as the meeting goes,
this seems like a more likely origin.

38
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:15.810
Since the cool kids were those who like to get drunk and the uncool kids were

39
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:20.040
those who abstained.
It affected the exact opposite of drunks.

40
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.650
Nerds besides the missing k.

41
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.160
The main problem with this theory is that the end you are dispelling doesn't

42
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:30.420
appear until the sixties and seventies one to two decades after the Newsweek

43
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.780
article,
which spelled it and e r.
D.

44
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.660
This to me suggests one of two possibilities.

45
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.410
Either the writers in the 1950s didn't know the drunk to nerd origin and

46
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.640
therefore spelled it wrong,

47
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.170
or the drunk Tinder origin came as a folk etymology and the 1960s which altered

48
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:51.060
the spelling,
though not for very long as n e r d eventually won out.

49
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.760
So one of the word comes from a funny would be zoo animal.

50
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:57.410
In the world of Dr Seuss or from drunk spelled backwards nerve.

51
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.960
I've certainly come a long way from their antisocial,
awkward beginnings.

52
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.020
Tell the next time,
don't forget to be awesome.
