Hi and welcome to this
week's grammar spotlight.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,280
Today we're going to talk about less
and fewer and when to use each one,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,030
but in order to do that and we have to
talk about the nails that less and fewer

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,980
modify all nouns can be divided
into two categories and no,

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,350
we're not talking about
proper nouns and common nouns.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,560
We're talking about countdowns and mass
nouns or non countdowns as their name

7
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:26,810
might suggest.
Countdowns are countable.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,990
They can be pluralized by adding s and
they can take the indefinite article a

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,781
for example,

10
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:37,781
houses account down because I can count
it pluralize it and use a before it for

11
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,960
countdowns. Fewer as used.
Thus I have fewer houses,

12
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:44,180
fewer monkeys and 10 items or fewer

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,050
wait bass nailed or non count.

14
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:53,051
Nouns are nouns that cannot be divided
into countable units such as information.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,740
Information cannot be counted,

16
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:59,370
cannot be pluralized by adding
this and cannot be used with a,

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,540
thus I have less information,
less homework and less furniture,

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,250
not fewer information's fewer
homeworks and fewer furnitures,

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,270
but be careful because there are words
that can be used as both countdowns and

20
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:16,650
mass nouns. Self for example, is
normally used as a mass known.

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,890
There is less salt on
the food than the table,

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,870
but in chemistry I might have fewer
salts than I'm accustomed to and now the

23
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,750
exceptions. What good would
the rule be without exceptions?

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,590
Less is often used in place of fewer
with dealing with expressions of

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,910
measurement and time,

26
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,030
so I make less than $12 an hour and
their child is less than two years old.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,530
While there are some exceptions,

28
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,460
keeping in mind the general rule of fewer
for countdowns and less for non count

29
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:48,780
downs,
we'll give you a lot less heartache.

30
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,140
And in case you were wondering,
yes, this is a prescriptive rule.

31
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,090
Let's use to be considered perfectly
adequate for countdowns and mass nouns.

32
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,440
The injury for less than the
Oxford English dictionary
shows that as far back as

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,210
eight 88 eight d when we were
still speaking old English,

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,970
Lex was used with countdowns as well,

35
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,830
but that isn't the only example that
Oxford lists John Lilly and early modern

36
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:18,460
English rider of the 16th century
wrote the following in his book,

37
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,780
the Anatomy of wit.

38
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,890
I think there are a few universities
that have less false than Oxford.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,960
Many that have more and yes,
those these in use and that the,

40
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:32,440
in our written correctly, at least for
16th century English. Until next time,

41
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:37,420
I hope you have less Sar
when fewer troubles than
usual this week or else fewer

42
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:40,990
sorrows in less trouble.
Both that usual, as I said,

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,020
some downs are both
countdowns and on countdowns.
