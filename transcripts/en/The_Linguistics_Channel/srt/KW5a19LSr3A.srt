1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,200
Literally in a literal,
exact or actual sense,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,570
not figuratively or allegorically.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,920
The primary definition of the word
literally literally used to indicate that

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:14,880
some metaphorical or hyperbolic
will expression is to be
taken in the strongest,

5
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,360
admissible since
virtually or figuratively.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,210
Second definition of the word literally.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,020
And it's that second definition that
grammar prescriptive is seemed to be

8
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,350
uncomfortable with.
So in defense of that second definition,

9
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:33,351
meaning figuratively or virtually allow
me to present a case for literally the

10
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:36,840
first argument of the prosecution states.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,830
But isn't it impossible for literally to
retain its original meaning so long it

12
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:45,120
is being used to express the opposing
idea and won't having two opposing

13
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,700
definitions caused confusion.
Actually,

14
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:51,960
English has quite a few words that
simultaneously cold what meaning and its

15
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:56,140
polar opposite. They're called
Auto Antonyms or conference.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,001
For example,

17
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:02,001
I can cleave a tree in two with my ax
or as genesis suggests I can cleave unto

18
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:02,904
my wife.

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,140
One definition means to divide while
the other definition means to bring

20
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:10,740
together, despite having one word
with two opposing definitions.

21
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:15,120
Both definitions have remained intact
and given the fact that context among

22
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:19,410
other things helps to determine meaning
and the beauty and confusion are

23
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,160
unlikely.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,150
I submit that literally like many
other auto antonyms such as dusting the

25
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,650
furniture by removing dust,

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,860
but dusting a cake by adding dust can
maintain both definitions while still

27
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:34,740
maintaining low levels of ambiguity.

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,670
The second argument of the prosecution
states that the original definition of

29
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:43,230
the word literally is in an actual
sense and therefore if you use it in any

30
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:46,350
other way, you're using
it wrong. First of all,

31
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,450
we're definitions are constantly changing.

32
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:52,530
It's a part of language and it's a part
of life. The word meats, for example,

33
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:55,260
did not always refer to
this flesh of animals.

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,470
It used to be a general word to describe
any edible non liquid substance much in

35
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:03,210
the same way we use the word food today.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,300
It's true that the original
definition of the word means actually,

37
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,810
but the other definition of the
word used as an intensifier,

38
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:14,370
which we'll talk about later,
is used in figurative situations.

39
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,950
And as much as a handful of
snooty grammar prescriptive,

40
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,690
this would like to have control over how
people speak. It is in fact the masses,

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,810
not the pretentious few who ended
up deciding the fate of a language.

42
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,720
I submit that even if the dictionary
did not include this second definition,

43
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,750
which it does literally have more than
one valid definition because we as a

44
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:38,670
people have given it more than one.

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,660
So while the original meaning of literally
is in an actual sense of the word,

46
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,380
has since broken out of that original
meaning literally can now mean

47
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:48,780
figuratively and it's commonly employed,

48
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,250
has an intensifier and intensifiers a
word that has little semantic content of

49
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:57,840
his own, but as used to intensify
the meaning of a word or phrase,

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
which it modifies.

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,380
A couple of examples of intensifiers
are so as an I'm so tired and dead as in

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,310
your dead wrong,
very agreeably are also intensifiers.

53
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:14,311
But unlike so in dead very and really
have quite a bit in common with literally

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,660
vary from the England Norman [inaudible]
with the modern French word for play

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,610
used to have the meaning of truly or
actually and really coming from the word

56
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,650
real had a similar meeting.

57
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,400
Now both words are often
just use as intensifiers
although the original meanings

58
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,460
of the words are still employed
in some context. When do you say,

59
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,450
I'm really excited.

60
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,630
You don't mean that in all reality
or truthfulness you are excited.

61
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,070
You mean my level of excitement surpasses
that of just being plain excited.

62
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,610
I'm really excited.
I submit that literally is taking,

63
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:49,360
it's rightly deserve place as an
intensifier in the English language and it

64
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:54,361
cannot be judged based solely on its
original meaning and the final argument of

65
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:55,840
the prosecution states.

66
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,530
This is just a modern corruption
of the English language.

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,980
I guess everything is relative
but considering the fact
that using literally in

68
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:06,910
a non literal sense has been around for
longer than the United States itself.

69
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,770
I wouldn't necessarily call this a
modern corruption and tell next time.

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,590
I'm literally going to bite the head
off of the next person that says,

71
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:18,090
I'm using literally wrong.
Um, well, I think that was,

72
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,930
come on.
