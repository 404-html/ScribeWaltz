1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,360
As you all know intuitively whether or
not you've actually thought about it.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,220
Language is made up of individual sounds
that when combined together give us the

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,380
words that we use in speech.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,730
The scientific study of these
sounds is called phonetics.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,290
When we understand the language,

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:20,400
we can distinguish between the sounds
that exist in that language combined

7
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,480
sounds together to form words and
understand others when they combine sounds

8
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,220
together to form words at their own.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,670
But when you hear someone talking in a
language that you know next to nothing

10
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,520
about the individual
sounds strung together,

11
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:36,840
don't form words in your ears.
They're perceived as generous

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,480
because of the inherent knowledge that
we have of the sound system that exists

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,470
in our native language and the knowledge
that we have of the written language

14
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,990
that we've learned through study.
Generally speaking,

15
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:52,590
we know how a word ought to be
pronounced just by looking at it,

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,560
even though in some languages,
English among them,

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,730
the combination of letters in a word
doesn't necessarily suggest how to

18
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,410
pronounce it.
For example,

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,980
a native speaker knows that doubt
is pronounced doubt, not doubt,

20
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:09,510
but that kernel is pronounced colonel,

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,540
not colo now and that no and know
are pronounced exactly the same.

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,200
This inconsistency between spelling
and pronunciation has been famously

23
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:23,340
illustrated by this word often
attributed to George Bernard Shaw.

24
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:25,110
Though its origins seems unclear,

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,190
which spells fish using
the g h as in tough,

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,260
the o as in women and
the TCI as in nation.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,480
Also potato.
Yeah,

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,990
but although we do know how to
pronounce many words by sight,

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,720
what about words we've never
pronounced out loud before?

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,790
What about words in other languages?

31
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:52,791
Who's spellings and pronunciations are
unclear to us for that we have the IPA.

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,020
IPA stands for international phonetic
alphabet and unlike other reselling

33
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:00,390
systems that only worked
for native speakers,

34
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,540
Dick Shun Narr re the IPA include
standardized phonetic representations for

35
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,740
every sound that exists
in every known language.

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,180
The international phonetic alphabet
offers a letter or symbol that corresponds

37
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,290
to every individual sound that
exists in the languages of the world.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,440
This makes learning the IPA extremely
useful indeed prerequisite for anyone

39
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:28,440
who's interested in the serious
study of language. To start off,

40
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,290
it's best to familiarize yourself
with the sounds that exist in your own

41
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,010
language.

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,700
So today I will be presenting you with
the IPA symbols and their corresponding

43
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:39,000
towns for the consonants in
the English language. Uh,

44
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:42,780
constantly is formed when in some way we
restrict the passage of air through the

45
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:45,480
vocal track by,
among other things,

46
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,990
the moving or contorting
of our lips and tones.

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,040
All consonant sounds are classified
according to three basic criteria,

48
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,870
place of articulation, which refers to
where the sound is produced in the mouth,

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,890
manner of articulation,

50
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,600
which refers to how the sound is
produced in the mouth and voicing,

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,800
which tells you whether or not the sound
is produced with the vibration of the

52
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,120
vocal chords.
In this,

53
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,480
this episode I will describe the consonant
sounds according to their place of

54
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,380
articulation.

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,550
You'll have to wait until part two to
hear about how the sounds are classified

56
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,620
according to the other two criteria.

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,080
As I present the different
places of articulation,

58
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,910
I'll also placed on the screen the IPA
symbol that corresponds to each of the

59
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:31,360
consonants that are made at
each place of articulation.

60
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,570
The sounds that I will be producing
here will be shown using the IPA symbol

61
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:37,280
between two slashes on the screen.

62
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,790
The slashes indicate that at phone
nemic transcription is being used.

63
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,540
Don't worry too much about the terminology
now in future videos I'll go into

64
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,010
greater depth on this subject.

65
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,300
Here we go.

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,720
A bilabial is a sound produced using
bold lips by meaning two and Lavey over

67
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:56,690
referring to the lip and English.
There are three

68
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,380
as in buckle

69
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,920
as in potato and ma as in muscle,
a lab.

70
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,400
You know dental is a sound that's made
by touching the bottom of the upper teeth

71
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,210
to the lower lip. In English there
are two sentence made this way

72
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,990
as in future and as in vase or vase.

73
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,930
An interdental is this sound made by
placing the tongue between the top and

74
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:32,480
bottom teeth in English there are two

75
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,500
as in think and as in those then
you thought all the symbols,

76
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:45,810
we're going to be easy and Alveolar is
a sound that's made by touching the tip

77
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:49,350
of the tongue on the alveolar
ridge. That weird, hard,

78
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:52,860
bumpy thing right behind
the front teeth in English.

79
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,570
There are seven sentence made.

80
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,570
This as in top D as in danger,

81
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,760
no as in nothing,

82
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,090
so as an sourcer,

83
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,420
Z as in Zombie,

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,200
look as in lake and rough in retro note.

85
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,550
The official sound for the right side up
are is as in the Spanish word Pero Pero

86
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,610
Kalyan although the upside down our is
the official symbol for the r sound in

87
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:35,080
English. Sometimes we cooperate to the
right side up our for transcription.

88
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,620
It is very common to do this
so keep an eye out for it.

89
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,090
A post lb layer is a sound that's produced
by placing the tip of the tongue just

90
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:47,290
behind the alveolar ridge and sort
of bunching up the tongue behind it.

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,040
These sounds are generally considered
partially palatalized because they share

92
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,880
some characteristics with the pellet
holes which we'll discuss in a moment.

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,310
In English there are four post lb there,
consonants,

94
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,290
cheap as in cheese,
J as in jeep,

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,880
she as in sheep and as an measure or
when doing transcription in English.

96
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,750
Sometimes these other symbols are used
in place of the ones that I showed you so

97
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,100
keep an eye out for that as well.

98
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,900
A palatal is a sound that's
made by bringing the center
of the tongue up to the

99
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:24,100
hard palate,

100
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,900
the hard part of the roof of your mouth
located just behind the Alveolar Ridge

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,940
in English.

102
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,940
There is only one true
palatal yet as in you,

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,550
uh, Vilar is a sound that's produced by
bringing the back of the tongue up to the

104
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:42,640
soft palate,
the soft part of the roof of the mouth,

105
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,230
also known as the Villum in English.
There are three sounds made this way

106
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,900
as in key.
Good as in good and

107
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,400
isn't seen.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,230
Note this sound is a curious
one in English and really
only occurs at the end of

109
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:06,420
a word.
In the example given earlier,

110
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:11,370
some may think that they pronounced the
gut at the end of seeing and some may in

111
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:12,330
fact pronounce it,

112
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,960
but it's far more common to hear the
Vilar that we've already mentioned.

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,100
It's far more common to hear
seeing instead of seeing good.

114
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,660
Generally the only time you'll ever
hear seeing good is if someone's over

115
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,060
annunciating.
As in the following example,

116
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,260
I think we need to sing a duet with
what do you think we need to do?

117
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,750
Seeing a duet,

118
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,410
a glottal was a sound that's produced
by the passing of air through the open

119
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,630
Gladys in this part of the neck

120
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,810
as in house. I know what you're
thinking. What about the w?

121
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,290
The sound as in water is a
co articulated consonant,

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,570
meaning that it's produced at
two places of articulation.

123
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,960
It's a bilabial because it's produced
with both lips and a Vilar because of the

124
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:03,090
position of the tongue.
For that reason,

125
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:07,770
it defies easy classification and is
sometimes known as a lady. Oh, Vilar.

126
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,910
Well,
there you have it.

127
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:12,420
All of the consonants classified
according to their place of articulation.

128
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,410
Stay tuned for part two where we will
discuss the other two criteria that help

129
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,230
us classify these consonants.
Sounds.
