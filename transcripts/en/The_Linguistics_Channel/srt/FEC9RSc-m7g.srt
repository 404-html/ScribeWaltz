00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,140
Here's a question for you.
Is using proper grammar important?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,520
The answer is yes and no.
In fact,

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,600
the correct answer is probably,
it depends. Let me explain.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,210
In linguistics,
grammar is generally defined,

5
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:19,230
has a knowledge of the system of rules
implicit in a language that exists in the

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:24,000
mind of a speaker, which includes rules
for phonology, morphology, syntax,

7
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:24,960
and semantics.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,170
But when we try to take that knowledge
out of the mine of the speaker and write

9
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:31,740
it down, one is produce can
be described in three ways.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,940
Descriptive grinders attempt to describe
the rules that exist in the minds of

11
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:39,900
the speakers and do not attempt
to tell you how you should speak.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,290
Prescriptive grammars attempt to prescribe
certain rules of grammar and do tell

13
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:47,070
you how you should speak.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,270
Teaching grammars are generally used in
schools and are used to teach students a

15
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:53,250
standard dialect of the language,

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,280
whether or not their native
speakers of that language. Today,

17
00:00:56,281 --> 00:01:00,150
we're mainly going to talk about
prescriptive grammars for the sake of this

18
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:00,421
study,

19
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:04,260
let's look at the word important in two
different ways as we attempt to answer

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,610
the following questions.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,500
One is using proper grammar important
as it relates to the purpose of language

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,050
that is done using proper grammar.

23
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:17,550
Help us to exchange ideas between
two groups of people and if so,

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,540
can using improper grammar
be equally as successful too?

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,940
Is using proper grammar
socially important?

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,680
That is is using proper grammar
important to us as a society?

27
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,610
Whether or not it aids in communication?
If so,

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,770
should it be important first
or we're not prescriptive.

29
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:37,350
This grammar prescriptive,
this,

30
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,860
I'm more concerned about the
social importance of grammar.

31
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,280
They're not interested in whether
a rule of grammar helps or hinders

32
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:45,150
communication.

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,510
They're more interested in whether or
not their language and the language of

34
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,710
others is correct.

35
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,550
That it's held to the highest standard
even when many times that standard is

36
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,730
based on an arbitrary set of rules and
governed by the pretentious elites of

37
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,350
society.
In other words,

38
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:02,370
grammar is important to them just because
they see everything as right or wrong.

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,210
If it was correct or standard grammar,
you're seen as better than others,

40
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,790
not necessarily because you
communicate more clearly,

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,250
but because you do
things in the proper way.

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,610
If you use bad or substitute or grammar,
you're seen as wrong.

43
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,240
Whether or not you communicated
your idea clearly to the other party

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,961
prescriptive.

45
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:22,470
This can include those who
consider themselves grammar
Nazis who are constantly

46
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:25,800
correcting the grammar and pronunciation
of those around them who cringe when

47
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,720
they hear someone misuse who and Kuhn.

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,230
They are those who cry out against the
decay of grammar and the corruption of

49
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,600
the English language.
Interestingly enough,

50
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:37,080
crying out against the corruption of
language is not at all a new invention.

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,480
It's been going on for centuries.

52
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,470
One might even assume it's been going on
since the beginning of humankind itself

53
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,560
over 250 years ago.
Bishop Robert Loud of thing,

54
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:54,420
grammar prescriptive this of the 18th
century wrote down his series of arbitrary

55
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:59,380
rules designed to prescribe how both of
the upperclass should speak is from that

56
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:02,890
we get sucked rules as two negatives
make a positive and one was never end the

57
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,700
sentence with a preposition besides
being based on his personal preferences.

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,820
The other problem with many of his rules
is that there were based on the grammar

59
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,850
of Latin and made little
real sense in English,

60
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,790
Winston Churchill even famously mocked
that never end a sentence with a

61
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:20,140
preposition role by saying this is the
sort of nonsense up with which I will not

62
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:24,820
put what Louth and many other grammar
prescriptive is failed to realize is that

63
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:29,320
languages are constantly changing and
that language change or for that matter,

64
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:34,120
language variation does not equate with
language corruption. So while today,

65
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,220
some idealized the English of yesterday,

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,970
they should keep in mind that many
people who spoke the English of yesterday

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,410
still found fault in it.

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,190
The truth is English is no better
or worse than it used to be.

69
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,420
It's just different.

70
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,860
So is using proper grammar important as
it relates to the purpose of language?

71
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,060
Yes and no.

72
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,720
Many of our grammar rules do serve a
purpose as it relates to communicating

73
00:03:55,721 --> 00:04:00,340
clearly. And not all grammar rules are
prescriptive. Knowledge of word order,

74
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,400
for example, is very important
for communicating clearly.

75
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,790
And many times is not prescriptive.
Dad be a new pair of shoes bought.

76
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,010
Might be understandable,

77
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,150
but it's a lot less clear than dad
bought me a new pair of shoes yet I'm not

78
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,500
being a grammar prescriptive based.

79
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:18,370
When I tell you that you should use
this second sentence and not the first.

80
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,010
In order for this to be a prescriptive,
this rule,

81
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:25,090
both sentences would have to be things
that people actually say and both would

82
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:29,130
have to communicate the same idea clearly.
But if I were to say Jibo,

83
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,940
he went to the store and you said
actually it's Jim and I went to the store.

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,240
That would be an example
of prescriptive ism. Why?

85
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,620
Because of the like are examples of
variations that exist in the language and

86
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:43,720
both communicate the same idea.

87
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,740
Clearly I'm not at all confused
about who, when, where.

88
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,600
So using proper grammar can be important
as it relates to the exchange of ideas,

89
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,540
but that doesn't mean that
by using improper grammar,

90
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,550
I can't communicate this same idea just
as clearly as long as what I say he is

91
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:04,360
clearly understood. It makes no
difference how I say tomato, tomato.

92
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,480
If I use whom where I use me and I or
whether or not I use less and fewer

93
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:13,150
correctly in proper grammar
can be just as important,

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,600
just as useful at communicating ideas.

95
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,950
So is using proper grammar
socially important? Yes.

96
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,790
Using proper grammar may not always
be important as it relates to clearly

97
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,110
communicating ideas,

98
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,940
but it is important because
we've made it important.

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,600
Kind of like twilight is not
important as it relates to literature.

100
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,830
It's only important because
we made it so yeah, we did.

101
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,430
As a society,
we've made using proper grammar important,

102
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,630
especially in formal situations. If
you misuse their, they're on a resume,

103
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,840
say light too many times in
a job interview or confused,

104
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,370
APEC did effect in an essay,
chances aren't going to be looked down on.

105
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,240
You'll appear uneducated lower
class or even downright stupid.

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
Even though knowing all the rules of a
standard grammar doesn't necessarily make

107
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,870
you a better communicator.
Unfortunately,

108
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:09,290
looking down on others for how they use
language is often socially important in

109
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,120
informal situations as well.

110
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,570
No one should have to be judged by
their friends and informal conversation.

111
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,190
No one should be chastised for typing.
See you tonight.

112
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,480
Did a text message without
a period or for misspelling.

113
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,640
A word in the comment section of a
youtube video so long is that misspelling

114
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,730
doesn't cause confusion. Informal
situation should allow people to relax,

115
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,430
be friends,
communicate clearly and openly,

116
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,570
rounds more formal situations often
require a more standardized dialect and

117
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:40,490
grammar. Why? Just because it
shouldn't be this way, in my opinion.

118
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,520
No. As long as you could
communicate with me clearly,

119
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,640
I don't care how many grammar mistakes
you make besides variation is beautiful

120
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,320
and it makes linguistics
that much more interesting.

121
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,470
So next time you're tempted to look down
on someone because of a grammar mistake,

122
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,090
ask yourself the following, did I clearly
understand what he or she meant? If so,

123
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,690
but it go, here's a, her dialect
may deviate from the standard,

124
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,320
but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Until next time,

125
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,780
I wonder if capable in her mind
and Kate met Ron ever got together,

126
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,160
or if a hurricane might intercepted.
