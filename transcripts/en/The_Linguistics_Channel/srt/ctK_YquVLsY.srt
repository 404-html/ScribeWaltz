1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,380
Oranges or in soda or
a sickles orange roles.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,620
We're surrounded by oranges.
They're in our bathrooms,

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:11,040
in our kitchens and even on
our clothes and as a color,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,020
they're founded even more places. In
fact, if I didn't look so bad in orange,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,530
I probably be wearing an
orange shirt right now,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,920
but what are the origins
of the word orange?

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,940
The word originally comes from the
Dravidian peoples of ancient India.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,830
It was later borrowed into Sanskrit as
Nevada and then the fruit and the word

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,530
made its way into Persia.
After that,

10
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:38,880
it worked it's way farther west into the
Arabic speaking countries where it was

11
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:40,860
known as not Onj.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,560
Spanish speakers may recognize this as
a cognate with the Spanish word not on

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,830
and the early 1300 Arab traders brought
a bitter orange later known as the

14
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:54,330
Seville orange from the Middle East
to Sicily and the fruit quickly spread

15
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,740
throughout the rest of Europe.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,760
It was in Italian and French that the
word originally lost its initial end sound

17
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:04,440
through a process known
as the med analysis or re
bracketing Italians indefinite

18
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:08,320
article ending with the same sounds as
the first two letters of the word not on

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,990
absorb the initial end sound.
Nina not ONJ became, Ooh,

20
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,090
not on chef. And even more
understandably when the French bottle,

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,280
the word into their language,

22
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:22,281
the boundary between the article and
the word not ONJ became all too unclear.

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,780
You know, home became, you know, home.

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,360
They're pretty much
pronounced exactly the same.

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,800
The process is called re bracketing
precisely because the word boundaries are

26
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,634
changed.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,760
They're re bracketed there redefined
where once the boundary between words

28
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,180
existed here,

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,070
it was later put here to give you a
better idea of just how easy this is to

30
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,580
happen,

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,640
especially in a world where coming across
the word and writing would have been

32
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:53,670
exceedingly more rare.
Try saying the following,

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,160
an orange and orange,

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,570
they're pronounced almost exactly the
same and careful speech and exactly the

35
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:05,250
same in casual speech. So when the French
began to use this new and exotic word,

36
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:09,360
primarily in speech, some new,
they were saying in the home,

37
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,690
but others heard it as you know,
honk.

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,960
And it's here when the word enters
the English language by a French as an

39
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,284
orange.

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,740
It was later in the 16th century when the
word had already spread throughout all

41
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:24,540
of Europe.
That the sweet orange,

42
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,570
the orange we know and love today was
brought from China to Europe by Portuguese

43
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:33,390
merchants and later to the
Americas by the Spanish.

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,890
It is also around this time when we begin
to see the word used to describe the

45
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,170
color and tell next time,
orange,

46
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:42,630
you glad I didn't tell a
cheesy joke about oranges.
