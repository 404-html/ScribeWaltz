1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,540
Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thou.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
We've all read Shakespeare in school
and for many there enough vowels,

3
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:09,060
these dyes and dies to
make their heads hurt,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,620
but just what are these archaic pronouns
does seem to have bill place in modern

5
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:17,550
society. Today we're going to
talk about val, the Di and dine,

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,580
why you is used as a subject pronoun in
the plural and the singular and how all

7
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:27,360
of this has affected how we speak.
But first a brief English history lesson.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,590
Old English,
the predecessor to our modern variety.

9
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:34,140
It was spoken from four 58 D to
10 66 80 and resembled German.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,680
This is because English and
German share a common ancestor.

11
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:40,620
They can bolt trace their lineage
through the Germanic Klein,

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,150
but they developed independently English
being highly influenced by French and

13
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:47,440
Latin among other languages that change.

14
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:51,480
The middle English has said specifically
at 10 66 80 because this year marks the

15
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:53,790
Norman conquest of England,
the Normans.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,960
We're residents of northern friends who
spoke a language that was a predecessor

17
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:01,390
to modern French. We don't have a lot
of time to go into a lot of detail.

18
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:04,770
So suffice it to say that guy with a
really cool sounding name really in the

19
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:09,270
second Duke of Normandy or later William
the conqueror defeated a guy with a lot

20
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:10,470
less cool sounding name,

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,180
Harold and took control of England during
the Middle English period of 10 66 80

22
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:18,600
to 1458 d English
underwent a lot of changes,

23
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:22,770
not the least of which was the extensive
barring of both French and Latin words.

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,240
Early modern English spoken from 1458 d
tour around the turn of the 18th century

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,320
was the language of Shakespeare and the
language of the King James version of

26
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,770
the Bible and the English that we're
most concerned with today. First,

27
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,650
let's talk about pronouns.
Just stay with me. Pronouns,

28
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:39,390
take the place of a noun in a sentence.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,930
And in today's English we have quite a
few which can be divided into several

30
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:45,450
categories.
Subject pronouns like I,

31
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:50,040
she and they are used as the subject
of the sentence. I liked cheese,

32
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,570
object pronouns like me, her and then
our use as the object of the sentence.

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,190
Cheese likes me there also
reflexive pronouns like myself,

34
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:03,120
herself and themselves cause
that's of determiners like my,

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,320
her and there and possessive
pronouns like mine,

36
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,820
hers and theirs.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,720
So what does all this have to do
without the die and die in Shakespeare's

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,470
English and an older forms of English
as well that was used where we use the

39
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:21,210
singular you in today's English you are
cheese would have been rendered thou

40
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:25,080
art, cheese and Shakespeare's English
where thou is the subject pronouns,

41
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,980
cheese likes.

42
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:30,981
You would have been rendered cheese like
if the where the is the object Pronoun,

43
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,530
your cheese stinks would
have been rendered thy cheese
stinketh where thy is the

44
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:40,860
possessive determiner. It's not my cheese,
it's yours would have been rendered.

45
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,120
It's not my cheese,

46
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,410
it's the line where the line is the
possessive pronoun but there's more here

47
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:50,700
than meets the eye because you also
existed in Shakespeare's English as did a

48
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,810
more curious word.

49
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,850
Ye How do you and ye relate to bow and
the four that we have to go back a little

50
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,880
further notes to simplify
things and to avoid confusion.

51
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm going to use modern spellings and
modern pronunciation so they'll be trying

52
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,780
to tell me that I don't know how to
speak old English and middle English,

53
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,810
which you know I don't in early middle
English and in modern English that was

54
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:17,050
used exclusively to refer to an
individual in this second person.

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,650
If I were to talk to my friend,
I would say thou art my friend.

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,140
The was used exclusively
as the second person,

57
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,800
singular object Pronoun I love Thee.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,660
Ye on the other hand was used exclusively
to address multiple people in the

59
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,690
second person.
Ye are my friends.

60
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,970
You was used exclusively as the
second person, plural, object Pronoun.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,630
I love you.

62
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,530
You meaning I love you
all or I love you guys.

63
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,300
You in the plural.

64
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,780
It was in middle English through French
influence that English speakers first

65
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:54,280
started to use ie to not only refer it
to a group of people but to also refer to

66
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:58,270
an individual in a more formal manner.
To show respect.

67
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,290
It was originally something that you'd
say to your king, you are very wise,

68
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,640
your majesty or in modern
English you are all very wise.

69
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:09,820
Your Majesty kind of like you're so great
that you must be better than just one

70
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:10,990
individual person.

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,070
You was later used to respectfully
address any superior person.

72
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,120
Speakers of French will know that Wgu
is a formal way to address an individual

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,610
and then it's also used to
address a group of people,

74
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,320
but they may not know that who used to
be used exclusively to address multiple

75
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:26,800
people.

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,250
So when Shakespeare's Day you'd use vow
with your buddies or anyone inferior to

77
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:34,720
you and he with superior individuals
or when addressing multiple people.

78
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,070
So why did we stop using ye as a subject
pronouns and start using you for both

79
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:43,090
the subject pronouns and the object
or ma'am, basically bad grammar.

80
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,960
Instead of saying you are my friends
or a year my king and using the subject

81
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,650
from them,

82
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,540
people started saying you are my friends
or you are my king using the object

83
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,020
Pronoun in place at the subject pronouns.
How could this happen?

84
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,610
It doesn't make any sense.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Well one ye and you sound quite a bit of
like especially in casual speech and to

86
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:03,581
actually,

87
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:08,290
this is quite a bit like how many use me
as a subject pronoun in modern English

88
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,370
in certain contexts.

89
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,150
Some say Jim and me went to the store
instead of Jim and I went to the store

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,560
replacing the subject pronoun with an
object Pronoun throughout early modern

91
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,130
English III and you are used
interchangeably as subject pronouns,

92
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,280
but eventually you one out becoming the
subject Pronoun and remaining the object

93
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:31,030
Pronoun for both individuals and groups
as early modern English developed into

94
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,200
the English of today,

95
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
you began to be used more commonly to
address just anyone and thou the dye and

96
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,210
dine died out in most contexts.

97
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,070
Understandably you becoming the second
person singular subject Pronoun gave rise

98
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,900
to you all y'all,

99
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,010
you guys and the like because we
needed a way to differentiate between

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,620
individuals and groups.
Who knows,

101
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,560
maybe we'll continue on its present
course ended a few hundred years.

102
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:01,010
We'll be using me as a subject program
and then just about any case until next

103
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,200
time me like cheese.
