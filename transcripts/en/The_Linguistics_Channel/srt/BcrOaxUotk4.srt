Hi,
welcome to this week's video.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,300
Today we're going to be talking about
effect and effect and when to use each one

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,920
no to both words are pronounced pretty
similarly and therefore the distinguished

4
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:13,740
them. I'm going to pronounce
them a effect and effect.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,880
When I was in the eighth grade,

6
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,270
I had an English teacher
named Mrs Christianson who
would try to get us to learn

7
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:22,440
from our mistakes by making us do a
project that would demonstrate that we had

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:27,180
learned the correct principle for whatever
grammar rule we had viciously though

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,140
around and very much figuratively
slaughtered and apparently died,

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,400
totally misused,
a effect and effect of the paper.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,830
So then I went home and I
asked for my dad's helping,

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,420
thinking of some idea to put on a poster
and he greatly influenced my idea of

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,320
drawing some pictures of some rainy
scenes and then riding in my crappy eighth

14
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,430
grade handwriting.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,490
The rain in Spain affects the plane and
the effect of the rain is a soggy plane,

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,620
probably because he had just
watched my fair lady. Honestly,

17
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:02,120
I still didn't fully understand the
difference between a fact and effect,

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,390
but I submitted the poster and I moved
on with my life. So without further ado,

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,510
any effect is a verb and it means to
have an influence on it can also be

20
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,140
technically used as a noun,

21
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,360
but most of the time you're
going to see it as a verb.

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,080
So in the example given earlier
the subject, in this case,

23
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:23,400
the rain doesn't action to the
direct object. In this case,

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,670
the plane,
that action is offense,

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,700
the rain affects or has an
influence on the plane effect.

26
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,910
On the other hand is usually announced
in effect is basically something that was

27
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:39,210
brought at bat or a result
in the example given earlier.

28
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,530
Effect is a noun and the subject of the
sentence and the rest of the sentence

29
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:48,210
simply describes what the effect
of the rain was on the plane.

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,200
Essentially, it caused it to
be soggy. In this example,

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,220
the dog's heartfelt
ballad affected me deeply.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,400
We use a effect because we needed a verb
that meant to have an influence on the

33
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:06,330
dog's ballad influenced me in some way.
It affected me,

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,430
but in this example, the effect of the
dog's ballad on the cat was a brutal one.

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,750
We use effect because we needed
announced that meant result.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,340
We could've just as easily said,

37
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:21,360
the result of the dog's ballad
on the cat was a brutal one. Yes,

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,330
effect can be used as a bird,
though it's far less common.

39
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,130
When he effect is used as a verb.

40
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:30,960
It means to bring about something you
will often hear effect as a verb in the

41
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:35,730
phrase effect, a change, which
means to bring about a change.

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,690
As in the phrase we need to effect
a change in the world. Basically,

43
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:43,650
if you just remember that a defect
is a verb and effect is a noun,

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,880
you'll be right most of the time.
Until next time, go watch my fair lady.

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,870
It's a classic.
