Hi,

2
00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:03,120
this is Morgan from the linguistics
channel and you've probably noticed that I

3
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:05,230
haven't uploaded a video in a while.
Um,

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,270
I've been pretty busy and I haven't
made the time to keep this channel live.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,700
However,
I've noticed great growth in the channel.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,750
I have over 3000 subscribers now,
which is mind blowing. I can't,

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,950
I can't even believe that. Um,
I'm, I'm really grateful for, for,

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,890
for all the comments that you guys
have been leaving on my video. Many of,

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,250
many of you want me to come back,
you want me to make more videos,

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,300
which is exactly what I'm planning
to do in the coming months. Um,

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,270
so let me know what types of
videos you would like to see. Um,

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,280
I noticed that a large
base of my subscribers are
actually from a non English

13
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,430
speaking countries so
that many of you are, are,

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,590
are trying to learn English
as a second language. Um,

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,180
let me know if you'd like to see more
videos related to learning English as a

16
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:55,310
second language. Um, I think that would
be, that would be a fun project. Um,

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm also thinking about doing some more.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,020
Basically with sticks videos as well as
etymology videos like I did in the past.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,750
Um,

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,350
let me know in the comments below what
types of videos you'd like to see on this

21
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:11,940
channel. Because you're a subscriber, you
subscribe to this channel for a reason,

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,240
and I want to start producing
content, um, that, that,

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,910
that you guys will enjoy. Um, thank you
so much for the support. Until next time,

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,463
have a great day.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,750
I would also just like to mention
that I speak Spanish very fluently.

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,940
I speak some French and I can
sometimes get by in Portuguese.

27
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:37,760
So if you want to leave your comments
