1
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana this week.</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you guys just a sec to roll a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joint,</v>

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>pack a bowl or put fresh water in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bond.</v>

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.793
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are just a couple of the old </v>

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>school ways of getting stone these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also includes vaping,</v>

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>waxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edibles and oils.</v>

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.923
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried all of them a couple times </v>

8
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:21.384
<v Speaker 1>each to cure this darn glaucoma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I diagnosed myself with back in high </v>

9
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.340
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have been being cured,</v>

10
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>but there is always hope before we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a big discussion about marijuana,</v>

11
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>meaning legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health benefits,</v>

12
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>recreational use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more.</v>

13
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>It's only fair if I tell you guys a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about my history with weed.</v>

14
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.713
<v Speaker 1>After smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first joint during Sophomore Year of </v>

15
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:42.324
<v Speaker 1>college for a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was probably what most would consider </v>

16
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>a pothead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get stoned and watch TV,</v>

17
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or go grocery shopping and gathering all</v>

18
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>the best snacks I could get ahold of.</v>

19
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.303
<v Speaker 1>I should note I never got into a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robbed a bank or murdered anyone while </v>

20
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After College.</v>

21
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.624
<v Speaker 1>I smoke now and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually while just hanging out with </v>

22
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the marijuana raging through our</v>

23
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also seem to never get into a fight.</v>

24
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.923
<v Speaker 1>Rob a bank or murder anyone since moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>to la where medicinal marijuana is </v>

25
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least on the state level.</v>

26
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I got my med card and I smoke every </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple weeks.</v>

27
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.244
<v Speaker 1>Usually I enjoy a nice bowl at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a long day when I just want to veg </v>

28
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:23.814
<v Speaker 1>out and watch Seinfeld or the simpsons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to this day I haven't gotten into a </v>

29
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.854
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robbed a bank or murdered anyone while </v>

30
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to marijuana,</v>

31
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:34.644
<v Speaker 1>I'm a libertarian through and through </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do with my own body in my own </v>

32
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>house is nobody else's business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less the government.</v>

33
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>As long as I'm not doing harm to another</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

34
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>then I have the right to do as I wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a citizen.</v>

35
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>This is a place where libertarianism </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes absolute sense to me.</v>

36
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.843
<v Speaker 1>We don't even have to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>health benefits or the dangers of other </v>

37
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:57.924
<v Speaker 1>currently legal drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The liberal argument for weed is pretty </v>

38
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>good too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically is.</v>

39
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not doing any real damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you should be able to smoke it.</v>

40
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:06.504
<v Speaker 1>Plus we're putting too many people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail for partaking in a drug that </v>

41
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>generally doesn't lead to criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

42
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.773
<v Speaker 1>This is a case where libertarians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical liberals take on something </v>

43
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>really lines up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

44
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>conservatives in the US have generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>been against marijuana.</v>

45
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.693
<v Speaker 1>They call it a gateway drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much like calling </v>

46
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.323
<v Speaker 1>Gerber's a gateway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food conservatives have scared people </v>

47
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:31.224
<v Speaker 1>into thinking that marijuana will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a criminal or degenerate and they </v>

48
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:35.844
<v Speaker 1>don't mind wasting your taxpayer money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>locking up people for a personal choice </v>

49
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>that they do with their own bodies.</v>

50
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.403
<v Speaker 1>There are some conservatives who even </v>
<v Speaker 1>now with all we know about the multiple </v>

51
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:51.531
<v Speaker 1>benefits of marijuana are still against </v>
<v Speaker 1>legalizing even at a medicinal level.</v>

52
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's conservatives who also preach about</v>

53
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:55.764
<v Speaker 1>small government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet they seem to want to regulate what </v>

54
00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:58.764
<v Speaker 1>you do in the privacy of your own home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while at the same time wasting taxpayer </v>

55
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:03.304
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they say they want to save on </v>

56
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>trumped up criminal charges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

57
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:08.404
<v Speaker 1>none of these examples are perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why ran Paul Libertarian still </v>

58
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>hasn't fully come around on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana issue and Hillary Clinton,</v>

59
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>a Democrat hasn't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

60
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the Republican candidates are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>against it in one form or another,</v>

61
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:21.664
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that the only tolerable</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to watch a republican debate is </v>

62
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.863
<v Speaker 1>milestone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one candidate who I do think </v>

63
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.534
<v Speaker 1>understands the issue is Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to decriminalize marijuana at </v>

64
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>the federal level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

65
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:35.104
<v Speaker 1>in this incidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the big government guy who is </v>

66
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:38.164
<v Speaker 1>making the government smaller by getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>them out of your private life and not </v>

67
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>putting you in jail for having a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

68
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>If you are sick with cancer or with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's,</v>

69
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:47.554
<v Speaker 1>why should the government or any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being be able to stop you from </v>

70
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>doing anything that would alleviate your</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain and suffering?</v>

71
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.713
<v Speaker 1>If you get caught with marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you have your life ruined by </v>

72
00:03:58.361 --> 00:03:59.194
<v Speaker 1>being thrown in a federal jail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get really high and watched the </v>

73
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>wizard of Oz with dark side of the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing in the background doesn't really</v>

74
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:06.094
<v Speaker 1>sync up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are just some of the important </v>

75
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>questions that talking about weed brings</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

76
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.620
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is Angel Tieger </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles,</v>

77
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.473
<v Speaker 1>part of the Los Angeles medical cannabis</v>
<v Speaker 1>taskforce and owns her own edibles </v>

78
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruby Doobie.</v>

79
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>She got involved with marijuana after </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western medicine,</v>

80
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>failed to help her with her debilitating</v>
<v Speaker 1>migraines.</v>

81
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Angel now speaks about the medicinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of marijuana,</v>

82
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:28.594
<v Speaker 1>the ongoing quest for legalization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>removing the stigma attached to the </v>

83
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:33.214
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you have probably heard me tell </v>

84
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:35.974
<v Speaker 1>the story of how in 1997 I went to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie Air Force One after eating </v>

85
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>some pot brownies with a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

86
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.613
<v Speaker 1>The movie was sold out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we walked into another movie called </v>

87
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 1>contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I had never heard of.</v>

88
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.203
<v Speaker 1>Remember that incredibly mindblowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extended panorama of the universe that </v>

89
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>opens the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>it may sound Corny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my world actually felt bigger.</v>

91
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:56.824
<v Speaker 1>After seeing that movie stoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up reading many of the books by </v>

92
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:01.264
<v Speaker 1>Carl Sagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the author of contact and </v>

93
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>brilliant scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After seeing that movie,</v>

94
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.303
<v Speaker 1>that stoned moment opened up something </v>
<v Speaker 1>in me that got me interested in many of </v>

95
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that I talk about today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would have happened without the</v>

96
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 1>weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sure didn't hurt.</v>

97
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.833
<v Speaker 1>That also reminds me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to tell you about the week I </v>

98
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>spent in the red light district in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amsterdam a couple of years ago.</v>

99
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I just can't remember any of it.</v>

100
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Angel Tieger is a speaker and activist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an entrepreneur.</v>

101
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.163
<v Speaker 1>She works with the La Cannabis medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>task force and runs her own cannabis </v>

102
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.913
<v Speaker 1>edibles company known as Ruby Doobie and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a lot of Ruby doobie goodies </v>

103
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>in front of us right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angel,</v>

104
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>thanks for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for joining me.</v>

105
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for inviting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave.</v>

106
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited to talk to you because </v>

107
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I've wanted to do something a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more in depth on pot for a long time.</v>

108
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.063
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you brought pot cookies and </v>

109
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>brownies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get into this stuff first and then</v>

110
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about the history and </v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization.</v>

111
00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going</v>

112
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 2>in front of some of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

113
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.023
<v Speaker 2>I'm sweet dreams Brownie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dusted with a little bit of sea </v>

114
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 2>salt on top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about 57 milligrams here.</v>

115
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

116
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Fifty seven milligrams of thc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

117
00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:14.010
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat that.</v>

118
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.203
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel after?</v>

119
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.353
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally would not eat a whole </v>

120
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:18.244
<v Speaker 2>Brownie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have half and that's plenty for </v>

121
00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:24.910
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really depends on your metabolism</v>

122
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:26.050
<v Speaker 2>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

123
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.063
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how experienced you are and it can </v>

124
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.110
<v Speaker 2>differ on things depending on the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and on how much you've eaten that day.</v>

125
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.730
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

126
00:06:36.731 --> 00:06:39.340
<v Speaker 2>and dosage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dosage guidelines.</v>

127
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:41.194
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a recommended dosages that </v>
<v Speaker 2>between five and 15 milligrams for </v>

129
00:06:45.281 --> 00:06:48.070
<v Speaker 2>people or some who want between 20 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>30</v>

130
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.663
<v Speaker 1>and this is all sort of unchartered </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory for a lot of people because </v>

131
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.180
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I said once I,</v>

133
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.223
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got my weed card I went in there </v>

134
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:58.671
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>they showed me wax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They showed me oil.</v>

136
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 1>They showed me edibles and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

137
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>do you have any just weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>green buds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like old fashioned weed.</v>

139
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.810
<v Speaker 1>And that made me feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

140
00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:07.141
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

141
00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>that guy wants to smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is sort of the new thing,</v>

142
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

144
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.653
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think not as many people are familiar </v>

145
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:18.600
<v Speaker 2>with edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been around and um,</v>

146
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a great way to make use of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole plant because really what,</v>

147
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 2>when you smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're smoking the flowers,</v>

148
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:28.240
<v Speaker 2>the buds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still have all of the leaves and</v>

149
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.083
<v Speaker 2>the trim and the small buds and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has you active ingredients in it </v>

150
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:34.844
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's primarily what I use to make </v>

151
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 2>my goodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the peanut butter Brownie.</v>

152
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>A ginger cookie crew is very excited by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

153
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.943
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy a ginger cookies and cream </v>

154
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>cookies and chocolate chip cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I make cakes and other things</v>

155
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.953
<v Speaker 1>to lemon bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you make all this stuff and this is </v>

156
00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:58.680
<v Speaker 1>for people that may want the medicinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>

157
00:07:58.681 --> 00:08:01.020
<v Speaker 1>This is for people that may want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational benefits.</v>

158
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.850
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter to you,</v>

159
00:08:02.851 --> 00:08:03.684
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're selling it for then and </v>

160
00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:05.544
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice if someone could alleviate </v>

161
00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:07.584
<v Speaker 1>some pain.</v>

162
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked with the dispensary's,</v>

163
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I worked with a handful of dispensaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

164
00:08:11.341 --> 00:08:13.170
<v Speaker 2>in my area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

165
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

166
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:15.884
<v Speaker 2>I'm a member that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's providing edibles for my fellow </v>

167
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 2>members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

168
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

169
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't in California,</v>

170
00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:26.764
<v Speaker 2>you still have to get a doctor's </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendations even go to those </v>

171
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:31.683
<v Speaker 2>dispensary's so it isn't tried and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough to make the distinction between </v>

172
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:40.570
<v Speaker 2>what's recreate for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>

173
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.523
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to distinguish between a </v>

174
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.440
<v Speaker 2>recreational and medicinal because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

175
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 2>if you're using it to relax at the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the day and um,</v>

176
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.240
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to distress.</v>

177
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

178
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.023
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's get a little bit into your </v>

179
00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:04.310
<v Speaker 1>story and then we'll talk about business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and legalization and all that shit.</v>

180
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.010
<v Speaker 1>So you got into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd basically,</v>

181
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I think you were smoking it </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreationally,</v>

182
00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:09.674
<v Speaker 1>but the reason you really got into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was because you were having migraines </v>

183
00:09:12.591 --> 00:09:15.460
<v Speaker 1>and pretty much the western medicine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were trying</v>

184
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.570
<v Speaker 2>wasn't working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

185
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.563
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

186
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.403
<v Speaker 2>I think there were two forces that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a both intersected in and drove me </v>

187
00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:27.040
<v Speaker 2>into cannabis and definitely my </v>
<v Speaker 2>migraines.</v>

188
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

189
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.033
<v Speaker 2>I've had migraines for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years and about 10 years ago they </v>

190
00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:36.850
<v Speaker 2>started getting a lot worse and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequent and I was,</v>

191
00:09:36.851 --> 00:09:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying all kinds of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>medications.</v>

192
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

193
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.440
<v Speaker 2>steroids injected into my nap to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of them.</v>

194
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.573
<v Speaker 2>I had some prescriptions that were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong that they require the triplicate </v>

195
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.870
<v Speaker 2>prescription and nothing helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a,</v>

196
00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 2>lots of times that the drugs would </v>
<v Speaker 2>irritate my stomach so much that I would</v>

197
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.283
<v Speaker 2>feel worse sometimes they would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock me out and that's how I survived </v>

198
00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:08.620
<v Speaker 2>my migraines.</v>

199
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.740
<v Speaker 2>And cannabis is really what allowed me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

200
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.100
<v Speaker 2>to continue living and manage them </v>
<v Speaker 2>without having to check out for weeks at</v>

201
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 2>a time or days at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

202
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.100
<v Speaker 2>so that definitely treating my migraines</v>
<v Speaker 2>was one for us.</v>

203
00:10:27.101 --> 00:10:31.420
<v Speaker 2>And also a desire to simplify my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

204
00:10:31.421 --> 00:10:32.254
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

205
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I was working at the x prize foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a chief of staff there and um,</v>

206
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rewarding,</v>

207
00:10:40.001 --> 00:10:42.290
<v Speaker 2>challenging position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

208
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.320
<v Speaker 2>but I just felt that there was something</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>

209
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

210
00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:53.021
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't spending very much time with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>son who was two years old at the time,</v>

211
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to travel a lot and um,</v>

212
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to create a change in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life where I would,</v>

213
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not be so dependent on,</v>

214
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.710
<v Speaker 2>on a check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a grow,</v>

215
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.230
<v Speaker 2>grow my own food and Cook my own meals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

216
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.920
<v Speaker 2>and rather than pay someone to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

217
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do those things I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the one with,</v>

218
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.270
<v Speaker 2>with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

219
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.133
<v Speaker 1>So that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't just I want to get stoned </v>

220
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.720
<v Speaker 1>and had the good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got into the edible garden thing,</v>

221
00:11:31.721 --> 00:11:32.554
<v Speaker 1>which was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were growing weed but you were also </v>

222
00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:37.520
<v Speaker 1>growing stuff to actually eat and to eat</v>

223
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.080
<v Speaker 2>your child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were growing and at one point we were</v>

224
00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:46.081
<v Speaker 2>going enough food in our garden that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was too much for us to even eat.</v>

225
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.313
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbors would come and we encouraged </v>

226
00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:51.130
<v Speaker 2>our neighbors to come and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

227
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artichokes,</v>

228
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 2>peppers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggplants,</v>

229
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.430
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

230
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 2>collared Greens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shard Kale.</v>

231
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have,</v>

232
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:02.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lemon trees,</v>

233
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 2>apple trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nectarines,</v>

234
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.250
<v Speaker 2>oranges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful thing to,</v>

235
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 2>to just go outside and pick your food </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

236
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.413
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to get in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get anything fresher than </v>

237
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:18.030
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

238
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

239
00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:19.351
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

240
00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:20.184
<v Speaker 1>I live in La too and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a little outdoor space with a </v>

241
00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:25.290
<v Speaker 1>little garden and even if I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 1>plucking tomatoes or something,</v>

242
00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I find that very therapeutic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

243
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:32.010
<v Speaker 1>it is just that action of doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of growing something for yourself,</v>

244
00:12:32.011 --> 00:12:35.540
<v Speaker 1>whether it's marijuana or a tomato or </v>
<v Speaker 1>pepper or something.</v>

245
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.383
<v Speaker 1>Even right there connecting with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is all intertwined with </v>

246
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.190
<v Speaker 1>ultimately you going into this business.</v>

247
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

248
00:12:43.191 --> 00:12:48.050
<v Speaker 2>it's wanting to simplify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to be more in touch with nature,</v>

249
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

250
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.533
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy to get disconnected from </v>
<v Speaker 2>food and to know what food looks like </v>

251
00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:55.820
<v Speaker 2>when it's actually growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

252
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

253
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we first planted our garden,</v>

254
00:13:00.291 --> 00:13:05.291
<v Speaker 2>it was with the help of a nonprofit </v>
<v Speaker 2>called La Green grounds and uh,</v>

255
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.130
<v Speaker 2>we had 50 volunteers come out and help </v>
<v Speaker 2>us plant our front yard and our parkways</v>

256
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.473
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was intimidated because I had never </v>

257
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.063
<v Speaker 2>tried to grow food before and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know how it all worked and it's never </v>

258
00:13:23.481 --> 00:13:28.481
<v Speaker 2>put my hands in the dirt and planted </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and to watch things grow and to</v>

259
00:13:30.021 --> 00:13:32.690
<v Speaker 2>be able to feed my family that way and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and help,</v>

260
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed the neighborhood.</v>

261
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an amazing experience.</v>

262
00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:39.800
<v Speaker 2>And food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food is medicine.</v>

263
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis is medicine.</v>

264
00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't see much of a difference.</v>

265
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

266
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So you see this green thing that grows </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally from the earth,</v>

267
00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:50.084
<v Speaker 1>like all this other stuff that we eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that just sort of as an </v>

268
00:13:52.221 --> 00:13:55.790
<v Speaker 1>extension of every other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the city wasn't that thrilled.</v>

269
00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With your,</v>

270
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.853
<v Speaker 1>with your garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here you are a person that sort </v>

271
00:13:59.611 --> 00:14:04.070
<v Speaker 1>already takes life into your own hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your own property and the city of Los</v>

272
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:04.903
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they do?</v>

273
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

274
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Going back a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

275
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:12.740
<v Speaker 2>What got me inspired to plant the garden</v>
<v Speaker 2>was I watched a Ted talk by Ron Finley.</v>

276
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've heard of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

277
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.923
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guerrilla garden against gangster </v>

278
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.143
<v Speaker 2>gardener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole idea of that he presented </v>

279
00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:26.870
<v Speaker 2>growing your own food is like printing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own money.</v>

280
00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:27.704
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some things that just </v>

281
00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:32.450
<v Speaker 2>resonated so deeply with me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately after I saw the talk,</v>

282
00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in touch with la green grounds and</v>

283
00:14:35.991 --> 00:14:38.090
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to learn how to do this.</v>

284
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.860
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I volunteer?</v>

285
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

286
00:14:42.201 --> 00:14:43.034
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out they were actually looking </v>

287
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:49.220
<v Speaker 2>for an la resident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a to plant a garden.</v>

288
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

289
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the timing was perfect.</v>

290
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:53.684
<v Speaker 2>So we planted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were selected in and that's how we </v>

291
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 2>got our garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

292
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

293
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.060
<v Speaker 1>the city though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want you to do it at some point.</v>

294
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Ron,</v>

295
00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:07.350
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he did his ted talk,</v>

296
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.100
<v Speaker 1>he had planted an edible garden a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years before mine</v>

297
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.620
<v Speaker 2>and was cited and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to city council and,</v>

298
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.673
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made the case that it doesn't make </v>

299
00:15:19.931 --> 00:15:20.764
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should allow people to grow food on </v>

300
00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:23.260
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their parkways,</v>

301
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.790
<v Speaker 2>and the city council at that time agreed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and said that,</v>

302
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:28.923
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would work to change the laws and </v>

303
00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:32.770
<v Speaker 2>fast forward two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I plant,</v>

304
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:33.963
<v Speaker 2>we plant our garden and I was operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the assumption that it was all </v>

305
00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

306
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.020
<v Speaker 2>But the changes were in the works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

307
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 2>but a few months after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

308
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.620
<v Speaker 2>this w we were cited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guy,</v>

309
00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:53.380
<v Speaker 2>came to my house and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressively said,</v>

310
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this has to come out and you have</v>

311
00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:59.050
<v Speaker 2>48 hours to put it all back to the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

312
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.360
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

313
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing to do with weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to me,</v>

314
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.500
<v Speaker 1>this is growing squash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggplants.</v>

315
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

316
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:08.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like that.</v>

317
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

318
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.310
<v Speaker 2>that because we had the support of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

319
00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>La Green grounds and Ron and um,</v>

320
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.480
<v Speaker 2>it was easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get attention drawn to the,</v>

321
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.860
<v Speaker 2>to the issue it had been going on for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some time.</v>

322
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Steve Lopez from the La Times came out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrote an article about our,</v>

323
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.630
<v Speaker 2>our garden and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

324
00:16:31.631 --> 00:16:32.464
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helped bring the city council's </v>

325
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:41.041
<v Speaker 2>attention back to this issue and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>long after that they did change the laws</v>

326
00:16:41.831 --> 00:16:44.440
<v Speaker 2>so anyone in La can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

327
00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:46.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow fruits and vegetables on their,</v>

328
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.313
<v Speaker 2>on their parkway before you had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was only a short list of approved </v>

329
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:56.470
<v Speaker 2>things you could grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you wanted to deviate from that,</v>

330
00:16:56.471 --> 00:16:58.120
<v Speaker 2>you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

331
00:16:58.121 --> 00:17:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I think a file a request and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like $400.</v>

332
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Stephen asked just to ask</v>

333
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.660
<v Speaker 1>to use your own property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own yes.</v>

334
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you might not get the approval.</v>

336
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the way the law reads is you can</v>

337
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:15.010
<v Speaker 2>grow whatever you want except for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

338
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

339
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.940
<v Speaker 2>some fruit trees are not allowed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the parkway.</v>

340
00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:21.070
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge step.</v>

341
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.921
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>

342
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 1>as long as you have a medical marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>license,</v>

343
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:25.694
<v Speaker 1>you can also grow weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing you can't do that in the </v>

344
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:27.704
<v Speaker 1>front of your house though with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would say it would be </v>

345
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 1>such a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not the greatest idea.</v>

346
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:33.254
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't want to get too into the </v>

347
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:35.300
<v Speaker 1>weeds on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Pun intended,</v>

348
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.763
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was an interesting way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start because it shows how marijuana </v>

349
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:41.324
<v Speaker 1>and legalization and the distal uses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that are so tied into our legal </v>

350
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>system and then we can get into some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

351
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:48.861
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

352
00:17:48.861 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 1>so you have the Migraines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start saying,</v>

353
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:52.644
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to smoke weed to make myself </v>

354
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:55.434
<v Speaker 1>feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take to figure out what </v>

355
00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 1>worked for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what actually was the right strain?</v>

356
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 1>And can you talk about strains a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit?</v>

357
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.211
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

358
00:18:04.211 --> 00:18:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know with some conditions,</v>

359
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people look for particular strains.</v>

360
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

361
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

362
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there,</v>

363
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.210
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

364
00:18:16.211 --> 00:18:17.420
<v Speaker 2>let's do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do one on one.</v>

365
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.920
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about cannabis there a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis,</v>

366
00:18:20.921 --> 00:18:22.690
<v Speaker 2>indica and sativa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

367
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look different physically,</v>

368
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:32.110
<v Speaker 2>like sativa plants are usually taller </v>
<v Speaker 2>and leaner,</v>

369
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.570
<v Speaker 2>thinner branches and a grow better in </v>
<v Speaker 2>warmer climates.</v>

370
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Indicas are kind of shorter and Bush </v>
<v Speaker 2>year and heartier.</v>

371
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>besides that,</v>

372
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.120
<v Speaker 2>indicas are usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

373
00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:48.970
<v Speaker 2>they helped you relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

374
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people will use them at night to as</v>

375
00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:58.081
<v Speaker 2>a sleep aid or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sativas generally will give you more</v>

376
00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:05.071
<v Speaker 2>energy and let you keep more focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So more people will use.</v>

377
00:19:07.241 --> 00:19:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Sativa is during the day because you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>still function</v>

378
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.980
<v Speaker 1>all my comedian friends that get stoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>on sativas and write all day.</v>

379
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

380
00:19:15.311 --> 00:19:17.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

381
00:19:17.111 --> 00:19:18.470
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

382
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.413
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have strains that are either </v>

383
00:19:20.441 --> 00:19:22.840
<v Speaker 2>endeca or sativa or they can be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hybrid.</v>

384
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.263
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then each particular strain has its </v>

385
00:19:26.711 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 2>own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

386
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.613
<v Speaker 2>profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

387
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:34.390
<v Speaker 2>how much thc is in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much cbd is in there.</v>

388
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 1>So let's unpack that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thc is the psychoactive part.</v>

389
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And CBD is,</v>

390
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Speaker 1>is the medicinal part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that fair to describe it?</v>

391
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.250
<v Speaker 1>That thc also has medicinal</v>

392
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.870
<v Speaker 2>properties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is the psychoactive element.</v>

393
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.990
<v Speaker 2>CBD is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is cannabidiol.</v>

394
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.250
<v Speaker 2>It's another cannabinoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't the only two.</v>

395
00:19:57.251 --> 00:19:57.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

396
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.440
<v Speaker 2>there are others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

397
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.483
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but CBD does seem to have most of the </v>

398
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.850
<v Speaker 2>medicinal value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

399
00:20:06.851 --> 00:20:08.080
<v Speaker 2>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can.</v>

400
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:08.914
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been shown to a stop some tumor </v>

401
00:20:12.251 --> 00:20:13.380
<v Speaker 2>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

402
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.930
<v Speaker 2>it's great for pain relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

404
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.880
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

405
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.970
<v Speaker 2>reduces inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

406
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

407
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend that takes cbd oil for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and she told me all she does,</v>

408
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.230
<v Speaker 1>literally as she was a little dropper in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>

409
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.870
<v Speaker 1>she drops two drops every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

410
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.073
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have the diarrhea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vomiting and thoughts of suicide and </v>

411
00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:39.954
<v Speaker 1>restless leg syndrome and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy things that come with all the </v>

412
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:44.184
<v Speaker 1>commercials that you see on tv for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these other antidepressants and </v>

413
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 1>antianxiety it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

414
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.890
<v Speaker 2>it's so gentle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

415
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 2>it has so many benefits and has never </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed anyone.</v>

416
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

417
00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.550
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never murdered anyone,</v>

418
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boggles my mind that,</v>

419
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plant,</v>

420
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:11.040
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has so many medicinal properties.</v>

421
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.770
<v Speaker 2>So besides medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

422
00:21:13.771 --> 00:21:16.820
<v Speaker 2>what about renewable energy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

423
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.470
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

424
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's strong.</v>

425
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a strong fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>replaced so many things.</v>

426
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.343
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we look at it as such an </v>

427
00:21:27.691 --> 00:21:30.630
<v Speaker 2>evil thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

428
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

429
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell it.</v>

430
00:21:35.241 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 1>It truly boggles the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

431
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.041
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

432
00:21:38.041 --> 00:21:42.810
<v Speaker 1>So we have a thc cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

433
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.900
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the indigo and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sativa and the hybrids of that.</v>

434
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for the medicinal stuff,</v>

435
00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:50.610
<v Speaker 1>let's just do that first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

436
00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:53.670
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't want to get stoned but you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wanted medicinal benefits,</v>

437
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that's where you would use just the cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

438
00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CBD,</v>

439
00:21:59.681 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want that.</v>

440
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.253
<v Speaker 2>But there's been a lot of research </v>
<v Speaker 2>researched that shows that a cbd alone </v>

441
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.620
<v Speaker 2>is not as effective as when you mix it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with thc,</v>

442
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.430
<v Speaker 2>meaning that it's the whole plant that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to treat you with.</v>

443
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:23.431
<v Speaker 2>Not just taking one piece of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

444
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it's referred to as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entourage effect because there's so many</v>

445
00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:30.460
<v Speaker 2>elements and they all kind of worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

446
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.793
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people who are looking for cbd are </v>

447
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:41.251
<v Speaker 2>usually looking for cbd rich strains or </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some cases,</v>

448
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:42.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

449
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.350
<v Speaker 2>the concentrates and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

450
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.760
<v Speaker 2>but I think for the most part you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>find that they're more effective when,</v>

451
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.810
<v Speaker 2>when there is a little thc in there.</v>

452
00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you found the right one for you </v>

453
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.940
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

454
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.560
<v Speaker 1>first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take for you to find the</v>

455
00:22:57.561 --> 00:22:58.670
<v Speaker 1>weed that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

456
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.940
<v Speaker 1>these migraines?</v>

457
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.541
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

458
00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:01.374
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even think about weight as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment for my migraines because when </v>

459
00:23:04.651 --> 00:23:09.651
<v Speaker 2>I get bad migraines I would get barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm nauseous,</v>

460
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.930
<v Speaker 2>dizzy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

461
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking pot was the last thing I thought</v>

462
00:23:19.621 --> 00:23:21.580
<v Speaker 2>would help me really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

463
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.090
<v Speaker 2>but then I did read that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps.</v>

464
00:23:24.091 --> 00:23:27.150
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it's,</v>

465
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:28.023
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

466
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.940
<v Speaker 2>it relaxes me enough that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

467
00:23:32.941 --> 00:23:33.500
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

468
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.090
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps the nausea.</v>

469
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also it helps me control the anxiety</v>

470
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.170
<v Speaker 2>that comes along with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

471
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:46.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the onset of a migraine.</v>

472
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.863
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

473
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.310
<v Speaker 1>two things attacking you at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the Migraine,</v>

474
00:23:50.311 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>but then knowing it's coming now you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

475
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.010
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About that.</v>

476
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And try to hit both of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of those things.</v>

477
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

478
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

479
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.080
<v Speaker 1>So then you started doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was working.</v>

480
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.280
<v Speaker 1>When did you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

481
00:24:02.281 --> 00:24:03.114
<v Speaker 1>I could make a business out of this or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta I gotTa tell people what's going </v>

482
00:24:05.761 --> 00:24:06.594
<v Speaker 1>on here.</v>

483
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine was baking and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated by it and so I would um,</v>

485
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.470
<v Speaker 2>look up recipes and send them to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should try this,</v>

486
00:24:19.471 --> 00:24:21.180
<v Speaker 2>you should try that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's finally,</v>

487
00:24:21.181 --> 00:24:22.980
<v Speaker 2>he got to the point where you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what angel,</v>

488
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:28.430
<v Speaker 2>you should try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started experimenting and um,</v>

489
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.013
<v Speaker 2>that's how I got introduced to making </v>
<v Speaker 2>edibles and then I started trying them </v>

490
00:24:35.431 --> 00:24:36.264
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well honestly I tried a few edibles and </v>

491
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.220
<v Speaker 2>hated them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

492
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.490
<v Speaker 2>this is going back to like 2008 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

493
00:24:44.491 --> 00:24:45.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you.</v>

494
00:24:45.001 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Before they had perfected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

495
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that time he'd go to a dispensary and</v>

496
00:24:50.731 --> 00:24:55.200
<v Speaker 2>you see stuff that was just in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ziploc bags and,</v>

497
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally unappetizing to look at and </v>

498
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.540
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes didn't taste very good and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

499
00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:04.374
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found myself in those early days just </v>

500
00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:09.030
<v Speaker 2>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.030
<v Speaker 2>eating it real quick and just hoping for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

502
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.550
<v Speaker 1>we're now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like literally,</v>

503
00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like going into a great big</v>

504
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get any,</v>

505
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.840
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pizza sauces.</v>

506
00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:20.674
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

507
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.350
<v Speaker 1>this can be anything you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

508
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.300
<v Speaker 1>So you started making this and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really for yourself and then you started</v>

509
00:25:28.301 --> 00:25:29.134
<v Speaker 1>selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How quickly did you realize they were </v>

510
00:25:30.371 --> 00:25:34.330
<v Speaker 1>going to be some legal issues?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in California where it is legal?</v>

511
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

512
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.270
<v Speaker 2>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right away.</v>

513
00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

514
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.970
<v Speaker 2>there's still such a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception first of all.</v>

515
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

516
00:25:45.901 --> 00:25:48.480
<v Speaker 2>California was the first to allow for </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana.</v>

517
00:25:48.481 --> 00:25:52.650
<v Speaker 2>It's been that way for about 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

518
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond doing that,</v>

519
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.310
<v Speaker 2>there really aren't any regulations </v>
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>

520
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

521
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.430
<v Speaker 2>it's like the wild west or it has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

522
00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.743
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are a lot of people who want </v>

523
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:14.640
<v Speaker 2>to do the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to operate in a safe way,</v>

524
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.820
<v Speaker 2>but without guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without regulations,</v>

525
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't really do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

526
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there because of the perception problem,</v>

527
00:26:24.631 --> 00:26:29.130
<v Speaker 2>because of the stigma problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are no clear laws.</v>

528
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.990
<v Speaker 2>A dispensary's are still being attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>closed down,</v>

529
00:26:33.991 --> 00:26:35.760
<v Speaker 2>shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

530
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.470
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

531
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:40.200
<v Speaker 1>you're not making the dispensaries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

532
00:26:40.201 --> 00:26:41.034
<v Speaker 1>there was a dispensary maybe five blocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from me that about six ago was </v>

533
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:44.784
<v Speaker 1>closed down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was legal within the California set </v>

534
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:48.780
<v Speaker 1>of laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but federally,</v>

535
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:49.614
<v Speaker 1>because it's not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feds pretty much at anytime could </v>

536
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 1>come in and stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

537
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm at risk right now and we have no</v>

538
00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:58.910
<v Speaker 2>fans watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about that.</v>

539
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in,</v>

540
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 2>and it's not even just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that the,</v>

541
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.553
<v Speaker 2>I guess that is the case in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>instances that the feds do come in and </v>

542
00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:09.384
<v Speaker 2>shut them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even local municipalities are going </v>

543
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:15.540
<v Speaker 2>in and shutting down places because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're using,</v>

544
00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:16.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

545
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.070
<v Speaker 2>land use codes to evict people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened their landlords.</v>

546
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.600
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure shadow places down.</v>

547
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do you operate knowing that,</v>

548
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:33.610
<v Speaker 1>that sort of out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very precarious position to be in</v>

549
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.160
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a business person?</v>

550
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

551
00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:37.114
<v Speaker 2>first of all it's a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me it's primarily a passion </v>

552
00:27:41.561 --> 00:27:42.470
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

553
00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I do this because it means a lot to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in the industry and um,</v>

554
00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 2>to help change how help change </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspectives on it.</v>

555
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

556
00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I know that I believe that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are anti marijuana,</v>

557
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I really just a misinformed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

558
00:28:06.941 --> 00:28:09.580
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda,</v>

559
00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.693
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to take some time to get </v>

560
00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.160
<v Speaker 2>good real information out to people.</v>

561
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:19.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sorta like for people that are </v>

562
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 1>pro marijuana even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even recreationally,</v>

563
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:24.564
<v Speaker 1>but even medicinally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sorta the fault of you've had </v>

564
00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:28.890
<v Speaker 1>the government which scared people about</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

565
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:29.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think of those,</v>

566
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:32.190
<v Speaker 1>just those posters in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.130
<v Speaker 1>just like making everyone look evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed,</v>

568
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 1>and then even the Hollywood side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

569
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:38.544
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously very liberal and pro </v>

570
00:28:39.821 --> 00:28:42.480
<v Speaker 1>drug generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every movie related to Pod is just a</v>

571
00:28:42.481 --> 00:28:45.120
<v Speaker 1>bunch of goofballs doing ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

572
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.013
<v Speaker 1>So it makes it seem like it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you dumb or stupid or something </v>

573
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

574
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 1>There's really nothing in between those </v>
<v Speaker 1>two places,</v>

575
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:51.331
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

576
00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is between those two years,</v>

577
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.800
<v Speaker 2>you'd be surprised at how many of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fall in between.</v>

578
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Most people aren't at the extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

579
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that people are afraid to come</v>

580
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:04.314
<v Speaker 2>out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rightly so because because it is </v>

581
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:08.574
<v Speaker 2>still federally illegal and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there is still this stigma attached </v>

582
00:29:13.141 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

583
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 2>when I was working full time and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate world,</v>

584
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.283
<v Speaker 2>I definitely kept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might use a private because I didn't </v>

585
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:25.360
<v Speaker 2>want to be judged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

586
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.753
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel ashamed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want anyone to use that </v>

587
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 2>information against me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

588
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:35.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people fall into that </v>

589
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:38.994
<v Speaker 2>category and it's a shame because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy to keep those stereotypes </v>

590
00:29:43.811 --> 00:29:46.890
<v Speaker 2>going of the pot head stoner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

591
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to,</v>

592
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.553
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to dismiss the whole industry if that's </v>

593
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 2>all you have in your head when you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

594
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.370
<v Speaker 2>But there's so much more to it than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

595
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so fascinated by that because,</v>

596
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about,</v>

597
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay people coming out,</v>

598
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.370
<v Speaker 1>they're not trying to push anyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in gay.</v>

599
00:30:07.371 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 1>There is coming out for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

600
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:09.814
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist because I get emails all the </v>

601
00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:12.544
<v Speaker 1>time were atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in western societies where it's </v>

602
00:30:14.471 --> 00:30:15.304
<v Speaker 1>okay to be atheist will say I'm afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of coming out because you might have an </v>

603
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:21.790
<v Speaker 1>effect on my job or my parents or my </v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin or something like that.</v>

604
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And I never thought of it really in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of marijuana.</v>

605
00:30:25.481 --> 00:30:27.970
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a professional person you didn't want</v>

606
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:31.360
<v Speaker 1>to be seen a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did you remove that stigma?</v>

607
00:30:31.361 --> 00:30:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you go home to your parents and say,</v>

608
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go on and do this and weed</v>

609
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:42.320
<v Speaker 2>once I decided that this was important </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I wanted to do,</v>

610
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I definitely made a shift to being out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told my parents,</v>

611
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I'm doing.</v>

612
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I use cannabis for my migraines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use cannabis,</v>

613
00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

614
00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still a good mother,</v>

615
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a productive member of society.</v>

616
00:31:05.641 --> 00:31:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that they questioned me.</v>

617
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

618
00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 1>but you felt it was like sort of on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sell your case in a way or something.</v>

619
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting,</v>

620
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still,</v>

621
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.490
<v Speaker 2>even though they know what I do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is good.</v>

622
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believed that I'm providing a good.</v>

623
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

624
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they worry,</v>

625
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.680
<v Speaker 2>they worried they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

626
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:38.100
<v Speaker 2>they see how the laws are and see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

627
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a risk.</v>

628
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

629
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:43.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the laws that I simply cannot </v>

630
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 1>believe is this section one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

631
00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:48.274
<v Speaker 1>So this is that the federal government </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically says at this point that </v>

632
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:52.564
<v Speaker 1>marijuana has no medical benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a jillion studies that show </v>

633
00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:58.483
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a zillion examples of people </v>

634
00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 1>like yourself that show that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

635
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I've smoked weed after hurting my knee </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing basketball and fell better.</v>

636
00:32:06.551 --> 00:32:07.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

637
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.493
<v Speaker 1>most people know that this isn't true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the Obama administration </v>

638
00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:12.604
<v Speaker 1>that still is backing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when these dispensaries are closed </v>

639
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 1>here in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where again,</v>

640
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:20.140
<v Speaker 1>it is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is coming from Obama who was pretty</v>

641
00:32:20.141 --> 00:32:21.740
<v Speaker 1>good on weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

642
00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 1>it's so complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

643
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:23.973
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

644
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I had hoped for more change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

645
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did read the other day,</v>

646
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:31.474
<v Speaker 2>who knows if this is true that Gary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson predicted that Obama would we </v>

647
00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 2>classify or declassify it on his way out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

648
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:43.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of one by the way.</v>

649
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be amazing if he did that.</v>

650
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

651
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

652
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I had Gary Johnson on the show and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean a libertarian,</v>

653
00:32:55.061 --> 00:32:55.894
<v Speaker 1>as I was saying at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a libertarian should be the most pro </v>

654
00:32:58.151 --> 00:33:02.830
<v Speaker 1>we'd person there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is you and your life and you're not</v>

655
00:33:02.831 --> 00:33:03.664
<v Speaker 1>pushing it on kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing something that makes you </v>

656
00:33:05.561 --> 00:33:05.950
<v Speaker 1>feel bad.</v>

657
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

658
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem is just this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been this way for so long.</v>

659
00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:16.750
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to change course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're going pretty much</v>

660
00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.280
<v Speaker 2>one 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

661
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean to have cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

662
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:25.064
<v Speaker 2>on the schedule one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has led to so many people suffering </v>

663
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 2>needlessly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

664
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.343
<v Speaker 2>being put in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having criminal records that affect </v>

665
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.493
<v Speaker 2>the rest of their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's horrifying about it is that </v>

666
00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:41.374
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it impacts communities of color more so </v>

667
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:52.140
<v Speaker 2>this whole war on drugs is a failure and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

668
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:57.880
<v Speaker 2>it's been used as a way to target </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain communities.</v>

669
00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

670
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.373
<v Speaker 1>I think just this week there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that came out at one of </v>

671
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Nixon's advisors has now admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

672
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:06.983
<v Speaker 1>Part of what they did related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminalizing certain drugs was </v>

673
00:34:10.231 --> 00:34:14.340
<v Speaker 1>purposely aimed at minority communities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not just picking up</v>

674
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.130
<v Speaker 2>exactly fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

675
00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I read that same thing and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he admitted it was the hippies and,</v>

676
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.433
<v Speaker 2>and the African Americans that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be able to go into those </v>

677
00:34:26.071 --> 00:34:28.290
<v Speaker 2>communicate communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

678
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.370
<v Speaker 2>arrest their leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raid their homes with.</v>

679
00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:33.410
<v Speaker 2>That was the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

680
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:36.120
<v Speaker 2>and here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

681
00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still happening,</v>

682
00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.680
<v Speaker 2>it's still happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

683
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.950
<v Speaker 2>and so I think we're asking people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

684
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:48.270
<v Speaker 2>law enforcement to give up control of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

685
00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

686
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of law enforcement that,</v>

687
00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.653
<v Speaker 2>that believe that's for the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's still resistance because </v>

688
00:34:58.951 --> 00:35:02.010
<v Speaker 2>it's the way we've operated for so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

689
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

690
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So basically if you're a business owner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yourself or someone at a dispensary</v>

691
00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:07.004
<v Speaker 1>or you're just somebody that likes weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want this thing to flip as </v>

692
00:35:09.861 --> 00:35:12.830
<v Speaker 1>quickly as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically you want pretty much a lawsuit</v>

693
00:35:12.831 --> 00:35:17.831
<v Speaker 1>to get involved where the dispensary is </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut down and that case has to get up to</v>

694
00:35:17.841 --> 00:35:18.710
<v Speaker 1>the supreme court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

695
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.653
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that where you see that ultimately </v>

696
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.020
<v Speaker 1>the only way we're going to stop this </v>
<v Speaker 1>federally is through the Supreme Court?</v>

697
00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:24.854
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

698
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

699
00:35:26.081 --> 00:35:28.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read something that,</v>

700
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.203
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was normal issued it about </v>

701
00:35:31.491 --> 00:35:33.020
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

702
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.650
<v Speaker 2>that's probably not the fastest track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

703
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 2>it's more of a state's issue and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more states that,</v>

704
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.490
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

705
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.710
<v Speaker 2>legalize it then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll just kind of give us,</v>

706
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 2>we'll follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully,</v>

707
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders said he would schedule </v>

708
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:49.704
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Hillary Clinton said she'd move it to </v>

709
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 2>schedule to write waffling on this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned,</v>

710
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 2>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for California at least,</v>

711
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:02.430
<v Speaker 2>I can speak to that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

712
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:03.264
<v Speaker 2>that's what the La medical cannabis task</v>
<v Speaker 2>force is trying to accomplish here </v>

713
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.130
<v Speaker 2>locally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

714
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:08.964
<v Speaker 2>California is like 49 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>national market when it comes to </v>

715
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:12.624
<v Speaker 2>cannabis and La is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the center of all of that for us to </v>

716
00:36:16.621 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 2>not have common sense regulations for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this industry.</v>

717
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

718
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.180
<v Speaker 2>we all know it's here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.070
<v Speaker 2>the majority of La residents want it </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

720
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how are we going to provide access to</v>

721
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 2>people as part of it that it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivate people that smoke pot?</v>

722
00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.100
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was trying at the top,</v>

723
00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:38.934
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have this conversation without saying</v>

725
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:44.640
<v Speaker 2>things that sound silly like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some level of that,</v>

726
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.151
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

727
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I can think of my four years of college </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I sat on a couch stone,</v>

728
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 2>but if you had told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I would just go next door,</v>

729
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.280
<v Speaker 2>we could legalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably wouldn't have got up.</v>

730
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.800
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more fear that,</v>

731
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.793
<v Speaker 2>that has stopped the community from </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming together because when you know </v>

732
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:07.731
<v Speaker 2>that you could get busted at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to form alliances,</v>

733
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:08.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

734
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.080
<v Speaker 2>it promotes everyone having a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

735
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.363
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mentality of being just out for </v>

736
00:37:14.851 --> 00:37:15.930
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

737
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way it's been.</v>

738
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.983
<v Speaker 2>People operating kind of in the shadows </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to draw too much </v>

739
00:37:22.021 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 2>attention to themselves because who </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows what's gonna happen next week,</v>

740
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.290
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

741
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.350
<v Speaker 2>but that's what the task force is trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to accomplish is,</v>

742
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.193
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state of California recently passed </v>

743
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.810
<v Speaker 2>some laws that went into effect at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of this year,</v>

744
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:37.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

745
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Murcia medical marijuana regulation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Safety Act,</v>

746
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

747
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creates a path for legitimacy and,</v>

748
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.770
<v Speaker 2>and licensure for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for everyone that's in this industry,</v>

749
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's up to all the cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cities to,</v>

750
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.600
<v Speaker 2>to then enact regulations that comply </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

751
00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.913
<v Speaker 2>So La does have an opportunity now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're hoping to accomplish </v>

752
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:04.780
<v Speaker 2>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

753
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:10.490
<v Speaker 2>get some regulations on the books that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really encourages this industry.</v>

754
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:11.843
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

755
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.460
<v Speaker 2>we want it here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.130
<v Speaker 2>so what should that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

757
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.390
<v Speaker 2>how do we need to make that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

758
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

759
00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:20.574
<v Speaker 2>Reminds me of the fossil fuel versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>green energy argument because obviously </v>

760
00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:28.710
<v Speaker 2>like the fossil fuel lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big pharmacy has a lot of lobbyists,</v>

761
00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:29.544
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all paying all the politicians </v>

762
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 2>to basically keep weed illegal at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

763
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 2>keep cannabis illegal</v>

764
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 1>because they are trying to sell a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pills.</v>

765
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.150
<v Speaker 1>And it sort of goes back to what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>started with about creating a garden and</v>

766
00:38:43.151 --> 00:38:43.984
<v Speaker 1>a life that you could grow something out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the earth that could take care of </v>

767
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:50.020
<v Speaker 1>some of your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet we're so afraid of that and we'd</v>

768
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:53.470
<v Speaker 1>rather them handed to us in pill form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time,</v>

769
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.393
<v Speaker 1>half the commercial for that pill tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>you worse things than you had to take </v>

770
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.250
<v Speaker 1>four in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Side effects may include doing it.</v>

771
00:39:02.251 --> 00:39:04.510
<v Speaker 1>They should have to show those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>having those side effects,</v>

772
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.033
<v Speaker 1>show someone vomiting and on the toilet </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been diarrhea and thoughts as soon </v>

773
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:13.790
<v Speaker 1>as we hang gliding and they're dancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and it's like,</v>

774
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.690
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how much of that is just related to</v>

775
00:39:16.691 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 1>politics that the pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies don't want this to happen.</v>

776
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:20.210
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

777
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

778
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:27.100
<v Speaker 2>the way things are a benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people,</v>

779
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:28.483
<v Speaker 2>those people don't want to see things </v>
<v Speaker 2>change because that takes money out of </v>

780
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:36.050
<v Speaker 2>their pockets and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty simple.</v>

781
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.180
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

782
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.440
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

783
00:39:39.441 --> 00:39:42.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not about getting rich for me,</v>

784
00:39:42.681 --> 00:39:44.450
<v Speaker 2>it's about simplifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

785
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.313
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to just be as self </v>

786
00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:51.710
<v Speaker 2>sufficient as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

787
00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.700
<v Speaker 2>to grow my own food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grow my own medicine,</v>

788
00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:57.830
<v Speaker 2>to compost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

789
00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.030
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:39:59.031 --> 00:40:04.031
<v Speaker 2>to not have to go to a store for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that I need.</v>

791
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of the default mentality,</v>

792
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need something,</v>

793
00:40:08.961 --> 00:40:10.620
<v Speaker 2>you go out and buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

794
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.770
<v Speaker 2>you use something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done with it,</v>

795
00:40:12.771 --> 00:40:17.570
<v Speaker 2>you throw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're so disconnected from nature,</v>

796
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:18.703
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what we're doing to the </v>

797
00:40:20.361 --> 00:40:21.620
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

798
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.470
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not think about that.</v>

799
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.680
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

800
00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:31.730
<v Speaker 2>cannabis is an important part of taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of myself,</v>

801
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that,</v>

802
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

803
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

804
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.260
<v Speaker 2>it helps me in so many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

805
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to go to a doctor to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

806
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.090
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

807
00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.493
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

808
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see those guys,</v>

809
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:54.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you walk down Venice Boulevard right </v>

810
00:40:55.971 --> 00:40:56.804
<v Speaker 1>on the Strip there and we've got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys all dressed in green and there the </v>

811
00:40:58.821 --> 00:40:59.654
<v Speaker 1>four slash 20 doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a hat on with a weed leaf and </v>

812
00:41:01.431 --> 00:41:03.470
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that actually is doing some</v>

813
00:41:03.471 --> 00:41:05.780
<v Speaker 1>of the reverse effect because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

814
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.940
<v Speaker 1>this seems so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

815
00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

816
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.163
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of tourists taking pictures </v>

817
00:41:12.571 --> 00:41:14.720
<v Speaker 2>of those a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

818
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I think I did it exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

819
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.750
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

820
00:41:18.751 --> 00:41:21.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

821
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.830
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a spectacle.</v>

822
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's mostly what they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

823
00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm down there on Venice beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

824
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

825
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I do think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it points out kind of the,</v>

826
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

827
00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:38.643
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

828
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.140
<v Speaker 2>that there isn't really that much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>

829
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

830
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>

831
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:49.280
<v Speaker 2>between medicinal and recreational and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

832
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.073
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get a recommendation from a </v>

833
00:41:53.001 --> 00:41:55.790
<v Speaker 2>physician to get it in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

834
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty easy to do that.</v>

835
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Have there been any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

836
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 1>everything that I've read about what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in Colorado right now,</v>

837
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd say 90 percent of it has been very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

838
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Basically they're bringing in a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax revenue.</v>

839
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

840
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen anything about crime </v>

841
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 1>suddenly going up or suddenly other </v>
<v Speaker 1>spikes and other drug use.</v>

842
00:42:14.841 --> 00:42:15.674
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always say marijuana is a gateway </v>

843
00:42:16.941 --> 00:42:17.291
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

844
00:42:17.291 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 1>what do you say to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people say that</v>

845
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:19.791
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

846
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:22.130
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I wonder about,</v>

847
00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:22.964
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

848
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

849
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:25.154
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've used cannabis for many years and I </v>

850
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.500
<v Speaker 2>don't like to drink alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can occasionally,</v>

851
00:42:33.501 --> 00:42:38.410
<v Speaker 2>but it makes me a sneeze now I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>really congested and I don't,</v>

852
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I just don't really enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

853
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:44.970
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

854
00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's been research that shows</v>

855
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

856
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.310
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that can use drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not get addicted,</v>

857
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction is a,</v>

858
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.603
<v Speaker 2>is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to say that just because I smoke </v>

859
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.530
<v Speaker 2>cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

860
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:06.800
<v Speaker 2>headed down this road where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never come back.</v>

862
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's silly.</v>

863
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>

864
00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:09.723
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking how crazy it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they've demonized weed because </v>

865
00:43:12.581 --> 00:43:13.414
<v Speaker 1>when I said at the top of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never smoked weed until I was a </v>

866
00:43:14.831 --> 00:43:15.664
<v Speaker 1>sophomore in college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember smoking weed and then </v>

867
00:43:17.711 --> 00:43:19.900
<v Speaker 1>laughing or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever went on.</v>

868
00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

869
00:43:21.521 --> 00:43:23.500
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've told me weed is so horrible.</v>

870
00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:25.930
<v Speaker 1>So what about these other drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a weird way,</v>

871
00:43:25.931 --> 00:43:29.080
<v Speaker 1>by demonizing weed or marijuana and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>

872
00:43:29.081 --> 00:43:30.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever we're calling it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

873
00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:31.923
<v Speaker 1>they actually have convinced a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people I think to try other drugs </v>

874
00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.390
<v Speaker 1>because then you try weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

875
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:37.560
<v Speaker 1>this isn't so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

876
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:40.320
<v Speaker 2>what about crack and crack?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just saying.</v>

877
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

878
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

879
00:43:42.151 --> 00:43:47.151
<v Speaker 2>Because it's so clearly a </v>
<v Speaker 2>misinformation,</v>

880
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people aren't stupid,</v>

881
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:50.963
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

882
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

883
00:43:52.861 --> 00:43:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does send the wrong message.</v>

884
00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:54.830
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

885
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 1>do you think about how I noticed that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of my friends who used to be huge,</v>

886
00:43:58.581 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 1>huge potheads either don't smoke anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>or barely ever smoke or when they do,</v>

887
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 1>they only need the tiniest flub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said at the top,</v>

888
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:07.064
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke at this point maybe once a </v>

889
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take one puff,</v>

890
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:11.560
<v Speaker 1>a granddaddy purple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Grand Daddy,</v>

891
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.033
<v Speaker 1>which is an indycar because I told the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy I just want to melt into the couch </v>

892
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.820
<v Speaker 1>and watch tv and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really,</v>

893
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 1>it's once a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one pup,</v>

894
00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:18.674
<v Speaker 1>I'm good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But something about weed is different </v>

895
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:24.500
<v Speaker 1>than other drugs because people that use</v>
<v Speaker 1>it a lot of seem to.</v>

896
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I think George Carlin did a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

897
00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:29.090
<v Speaker 1>They seem to not grow out of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>

898
00:44:29.091 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>but it has a reverse addictive thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways.</v>

899
00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:32.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

900
00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 1>because for the people that get </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid,</v>

901
00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:35.280
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

902
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you would probably say,</v>

903
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:38.634
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be trying to go more than a </v>

904
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 1>sativa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

905
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.930
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

906
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:47.931
<v Speaker 2>so they have found that your body has an</v>
<v Speaker 2>endoccanabinoid system,</v>

907
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:53.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are receptors in your brain and</v>

908
00:44:53.141 --> 00:44:58.030
<v Speaker 2>all through your body that are there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept canabinoids.</v>

909
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

910
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.673
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you produce cannabinoids in your own </v>

911
00:45:03.011 --> 00:45:03.730
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

912
00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.470
<v Speaker 2>it's in breast milk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

913
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've found that what cannabis does,</v>

914
00:45:09.851 --> 00:45:10.684
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it affects your endocannabinoid system </v>

915
00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:13.834
<v Speaker 2>which then brings your body into balance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why it helps with so many </v>

916
00:45:19.631 --> 00:45:20.464
<v Speaker 2>elements and that's why for many years </v>
<v Speaker 2>people couldn't believe that it helps </v>

917
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.173
<v Speaker 2>with so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could it do this and this and this </v>

918
00:45:27.101 --> 00:45:28.000
<v Speaker 2>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

919
00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:28.893
<v Speaker 2>no drug does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because you have this built in </v>

920
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 2>regulation system in the endocannabinoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and cannabis helps bring.</v>

921
00:45:39.971 --> 00:45:40.804
<v Speaker 2>You're bringing that into balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it Kinda does make sense that if </v>

922
00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:45.970
<v Speaker 2>you're using it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:45:45.971 --> 00:45:46.804
<v Speaker 2>and that after a certain amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he need to use less because it's </v>

924
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:52.950
<v Speaker 2>just such an interesting</v>

925
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.180
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing about a drug,</v>

926
00:45:54.181 --> 00:45:55.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you know,</v>

927
00:45:55.271 --> 00:45:55.891
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

928
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you need more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it more,</v>

929
00:45:57.031 --> 00:45:57.864
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a lot of ways I know that that </v>

930
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 1>exists at some level with marijuana that</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my friends,</v>

931
00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:04.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to smoke more because it </v>

932
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:06.204
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hit them the way it used to or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll change strain or something like </v>

933
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.123
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people eventually either need </v>

934
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:13.020
<v Speaker 1>much less or have much less of a desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

935
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:16.200
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't fit any of the definitions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what addiction and drug.</v>

936
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need to.</v>

937
00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Normally with addiction you have to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>upping the dosage and the dosage and you</v>

938
00:46:21.461 --> 00:46:23.150
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for when I use,</v>

939
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.440
<v Speaker 2>when I have an edible cookie at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's 12,</v>

940
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:30.770
<v Speaker 2>13 milligrams and that's plenty for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

941
00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.693
<v Speaker 2>And I</v>

942
00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.330
<v Speaker 1>may not be migraine related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might just be</v>

943
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:37.190
<v Speaker 2>just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sleep aid,</v>

944
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if I'm feeling like it helps if your </v>

945
00:46:40.251 --> 00:46:41.390
<v Speaker 2>muscles are sore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:46:41.391 --> 00:46:46.391
<v Speaker 2>just relaxes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But 12 milligrams is not a lot.</v>

947
00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.440
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

948
00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.790
<v Speaker 2>if it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

949
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:56.780
<v Speaker 2>if that were true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction and,</v>

950
00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:01.030
<v Speaker 2>and having to have more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would be eating more,</v>

951
00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.300
<v Speaker 2>more cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

952
00:47:02.301 --> 00:47:04.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's one is fine</v>

953
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.730
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all carb free,</v>

954
00:47:05.731 --> 00:47:06.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

955
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.113
<v Speaker 1>So with some of the medicinal stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing a little research for </v>

956
00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:12.780
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see all kinds of crazy things.</v>

957
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see people that say literally,</v>

958
00:47:14.761 --> 00:47:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I cured brain cancer with just by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.463
<v Speaker 1>using cbd oil or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can see people that it </v>

960
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:22.920
<v Speaker 1>helped with pain or it helped with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nausea.</v>

961
00:47:22.921 --> 00:47:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I got my appetite back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really the gamut of everything.</v>

962
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.500
<v Speaker 1>What's like the most amazing case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever seen of,</v>

963
00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.910
<v Speaker 1>of helping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

964
00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:33.540
<v Speaker 1>something really serious like cancer or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's or somebody.</v>

965
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a good friend that had kronos,</v>

966
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.930
<v Speaker 2>has crohn's disease and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

967
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.823
<v Speaker 2>he really credits cannabis with giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>him his life back and he was suffering </v>

968
00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.590
<v Speaker 2>tremendously for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years.</v>

969
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:49.760
<v Speaker 2>And another friend of mine has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

970
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.890
<v Speaker 2>a young niece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

971
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 2>who had a brain tumor and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her family was treating it with the Rick</v>

972
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Simpson oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

973
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:02.880
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

974
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.460
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

975
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I've never tried it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

976
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:06.973
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

977
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:08.203
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick Simpson developed this method of </v>

978
00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:16.810
<v Speaker 2>making this concentrated oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

979
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.480
<v Speaker 2>and you can find directions on how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it yourself.</v>

980
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Was this like what they give very young </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids?</v>

981
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this sound to do with what happened</v>

982
00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:26.694
<v Speaker 1>in New Jersey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Kristy got in all that because I </v>

983
00:48:29.041 --> 00:48:32.850
<v Speaker 1>think he didn't want to pass it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then got sort of into it,</v>

984
00:48:32.851 --> 00:48:35.220
<v Speaker 1>which made no sense anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

985
00:48:35.221 --> 00:48:37.480
<v Speaker 1>wasn't he just allowing the CBD stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

986
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:38.940
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll,</v>

987
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.210
<v Speaker 1>we'll try that again.</v>

988
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.910
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

989
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that,</v>

990
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:48.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

991
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

992
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.253
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of people who really </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that it's helped them for so </v>

993
00:49:01.031 --> 00:49:02.740
<v Speaker 2>many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

994
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.360
<v Speaker 2>even if it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I have a bad back and I rub a topical on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

996
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.770
<v Speaker 2>on my back and I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

997
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not always about getting stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

998
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

999
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:17.944
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for a while I was volunteering in a </v>

1000
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.930
<v Speaker 2>cannabis physicians office and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1001
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:22.893
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would see different patients and how </v>

1002
00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:26.710
<v Speaker 2>they were using the medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1003
00:49:26.711 --> 00:49:28.300
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great for any kind of.</v>

1004
00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm a neuro neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1005
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 2>neuropathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:35.020
<v Speaker 2>any kind of nerve pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1007
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1008
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provides great relief for that.</v>

1009
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1010
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.920
<v Speaker 2>breast cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been studies showing that,</v>

1011
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:42.963
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've shown that it can really just </v>

1012
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>kill certain cancer cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1013
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.510
<v Speaker 2>to me that's incredible.</v>

1014
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.570
<v Speaker 1>So for the people that would say this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1015
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 1>they still have this stigma attached to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1016
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of them,</v>

1017
00:49:56.681 --> 00:49:59.980
<v Speaker 1>they don't want people to even deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own pain.</v>

1018
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:00.893
<v Speaker 1>It's unfathomable to me that if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>across from me had cancer or had </v>

1019
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rite eight or whatever it is,</v>

1020
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.550
<v Speaker 1>what right would I have to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1021
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that to yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>alleviate your pain.</v>

1022
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think goes on in the mind of</v>

1023
00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:17.460
<v Speaker 1>that person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1024
00:50:17.461 --> 00:50:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot imagine.</v>

1025
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1026
00:50:20.421 --> 00:50:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fear and misinformation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why.</v>

1027
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much again for having me </v>
<v Speaker 2>here because think it's,</v>

1028
00:50:27.721 --> 00:50:28.554
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so important to come out and speak </v>

1029
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:33.810
<v Speaker 2>on the topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1030
00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm fighting a stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1031
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.513
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do not consider myself a stoner </v>

1032
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 2>and I am very productive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1033
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:45.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1034
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I think that's</v>

1035
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:46.703
<v Speaker 1>the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's money to be made here for a lot </v>

1036
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening in Colorado right now.</v>

1037
00:50:50.301 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 1>It's happening across California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

1038
00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:54.540
<v Speaker 1>these are serious business people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1039
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like the new California gold rush </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way where you have to be willing to</v>

1040
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.310
<v Speaker 1>sort of put your butt on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose for hopefully not</v>

1041
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.820
<v Speaker 2>too much longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1042
00:51:03.821 --> 00:51:05.830
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

1043
00:51:05.831 --> 00:51:06.664
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the energy is definitely </v>

1044
00:51:08.861 --> 00:51:09.694
<v Speaker 2>going in the right direction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully we'll get some regulations in </v>

1045
00:51:13.691 --> 00:51:15.820
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially here in la because,</v>

1046
00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1047
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.353
<v Speaker 2>we are the center of this industry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we should take a leadership role in </v>

1048
00:51:23.111 --> 00:51:28.111
<v Speaker 2>creating regulations that could be used </v>
<v Speaker 2>other places as well.</v>

1049
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I'd really like to see is,</v>

1050
00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an industry that encourages </v>

1051
00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.953
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encourages a small business owners and </v>

1052
00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:43.360
<v Speaker 2>encourages creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1053
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:48.510
<v Speaker 2>and not a monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really another,</v>

1054
00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:53.820
<v Speaker 2>a goal of the task force is to allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to happen.</v>

1055
00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.193
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bring everyone in out of the </v>

1056
00:51:58.001 --> 00:52:03.001
<v Speaker 2>shadows and operate a legitimately.</v>

1057
00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know you don't buy the gateway drug</v>

1058
00:52:05.891 --> 00:52:06.724
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you stand on legalization of </v>

1059
00:52:08.021 --> 00:52:08.854
<v Speaker 1>all drugs in general?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think this is probably one of </v>

1060
00:52:11.111 --> 00:52:14.440
<v Speaker 1>the places where the argument gets tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>where suddenly you say,</v>

1061
00:52:14.441 --> 00:52:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm all in on weed and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot of people that say,</v>

1062
00:52:17.231 --> 00:52:18.064
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just all in on everything and then </v>

1063
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:20.194
<v Speaker 1>you could get what I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm basically for </v>

1064
00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:24.003
<v Speaker 1>legalization of most stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much I think people could make a </v>

1065
00:52:27.011 --> 00:52:29.860
<v Speaker 1>more sound case and say if you legalize </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff,</v>

1066
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.560
<v Speaker 1>people are going to just be trying all </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of really crazy.</v>

1067
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm not,</v>

1068
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm still sort of vacillating where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>

1069
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drugs,</v>

1070
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:45.100
<v Speaker 2>there are many drugs that aren't legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that people try and it doesn't limit</v>

1071
00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:47.940
<v Speaker 2>people's ability to access,</v>

1072
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can get</v>

1073
00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:50.780
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1074
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.500
<v Speaker 2>you're risking a going to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1075
00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

1076
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.373
<v Speaker 2>legalizing all drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that there are drugs that </v>

1077
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.770
<v Speaker 2>don't have any real health benefit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>are dangerous.</v>

1078
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think criminalizing activity</v>

1079
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1080
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:13.650
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the right answer.</v>

1081
00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to fight addiction,</v>

1082
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.490
<v Speaker 2>putting someone in prison is not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to solve that.</v>

1083
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:26.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm preventing them from having a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a life is not going to solve that.</v>

1084
00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:33.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy system that someone could </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to alleviate their pain because of a</v>

1085
00:53:33.131 --> 00:53:35.260
<v Speaker 1>chronic disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our,</v>

1086
00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:36.580
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1087
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.380
<v Speaker 1>the way we deal with them is by putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in jail.</v>

1088
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1089
00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:42.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>veteran veterans right now I really </v>

1090
00:53:43.511 --> 00:53:46.060
<v Speaker 2>fighting to get access to medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

1091
00:53:46.061 --> 00:53:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had to fight to be able to treat</v>

1092
00:53:50.081 --> 00:53:54.640
<v Speaker 2>their ptsd with cannabis is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1093
00:53:54.641 --> 00:53:56.320

<v Speaker 2>I think they've earned that.</v>

1094
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It has so many health benefits.</v>

1106
