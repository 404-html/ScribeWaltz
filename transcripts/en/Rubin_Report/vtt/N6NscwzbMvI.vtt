1
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is the first investor </v>
<v Speaker 1>in bitcoin.com,</v>

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.553
<v Speaker 1>blockchain.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and several other crypto currency </v>

3
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>websites who is also a libertarian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>individualistic and a peace advocate.</v>

4
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Roger Veer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to save over,</v>

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>but then I did a little research and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually veer.</v>

7
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Even though most people say this would </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead one to getting into cryptocurrency,</v>

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.273
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the exact reason that it's very </v>

9
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.114
<v Speaker 1>easy to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I would get into </v>

10
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrencies A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

11
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation because a,</v>

12
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned to you briefly before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started for about two years or so,</v>

13
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I've sort of been kind of looking into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this world.</v>

14
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:45.974
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the libertarian side of my audience of </v>

15
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very much into bitcoin,</v>

16
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>so I think probably for the first half </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this we have to just do,</v>

17
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>do one on one stuff.</v>

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready to have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your thinking cap on?</v>

19
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.850
<v Speaker 1>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

20
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Speaker 1>so for someone that's watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin,</v>

21
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:02.474
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it has some connotation to </v>

22
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Super Mario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>punching the question mark and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>coins out of this thing,</v>

24
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>which makes some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess at some level.</v>

25
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.453
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell is bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin is thanks to the invention of </v>

26
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin for the very first time in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire history of the world.</v>

27
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Any human being can now send and receive</v>
<v Speaker 1>any amount of money with any other human</v>

28
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>being anywhere on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly,</v>

29
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.223
<v Speaker 1>basically for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get permission from a </v>

30
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:32.014
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get permission from </v>

31
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:33.674
<v Speaker 1>the corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get permission from </v>

32
00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:35.674
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you not have to get their </v>

33
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:37.834
<v Speaker 1>permission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible for any of those </v>

34
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>entities to stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can now send money from,</v>

35
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 1>from here in la to to Moscow instantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like that for less than a penny.</v>

36
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.043
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing that the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>government can do that there's nothing </v>

37
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:52.504
<v Speaker 1>that the Chinese government can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that the American </v>

38
00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:54.604
<v Speaker 1>government can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think that it's a good thing </v>

39
00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:57.604
<v Speaker 1>that people have control of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and they're not susceptible to </v>

40
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>things like we had happened in Cyprus a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years back where the government just</v>

41
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 1>came in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

42
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a third of it.</v>

43
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's money in their bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>

44
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:08.644
<v Speaker 1>If you think things like that are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should love bitcoin and even if you </v>

45
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:12.604
<v Speaker 1>haven't used bitcoin yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might sound complicated and </v>

46
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think of it like email.</v>

47
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>If I sat here trying to explain to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>how email works,</v>

48
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.653
<v Speaker 1>it would sound really hard and confusing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how could anybody figure out how to </v>

49
00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>do this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you've used email,</v>

50
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not hard.</v>

51
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.853
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just type in the person's email </v>

52
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 1>address and you send them a message </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin's the same way.</v>

53
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 1>You just paste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copy and paste their bitcoin address and</v>

54
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you send them some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

55
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>so the best advice I can give to anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's new to bit coin,</v>

56
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>don't be afraid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on the Internet and uh,</v>

57
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.250
<v Speaker 1>get a bitcoin wallet and give it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

58
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>really easy to use once you've actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>used it.</v>

59
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to you that we take </v>

60
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 1>donations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.520
<v Speaker 1>at Rubin report.com/donate</v>
<v Speaker 1>a and we take bitcoin donations.</v>

62
00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:53.320
<v Speaker 1>We didn't do it for a while and we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people saying,</v>

63
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're missing a great opportunity here.</v>

64
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>So we did it and we have about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think around two and a half bitcoin.</v>

65
00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen it Kinda,</v>

66
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up and you can't really watch it </v>

67
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least from where I sit.</v>

68
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>You can't watch it everyday because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd start going crazy.</v>

69
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just like watching stocks everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

70
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>but what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What actually is.</v>

71
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:13.264
<v Speaker 1>And so I get the ease of transfer and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to talk to you about why some </v>

72
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.210
<v Speaker 1>governments kind of embraced it more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some really are against it and,</v>

73
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like people,</v>

74
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>that's what people want to like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like gold.</v>

75
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>We know what gold is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a thing.</v>

76
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>You can put it in your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what actually is Bitcoin,</v>

77
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>so with traditional monies that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are used to using like the dollar or the</v>

78
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.624
<v Speaker 1>euro or or or traditional payment </v>
<v Speaker 1>networks like paypal or visa or </v>

79
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>mastercard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things have one ledger that</v>

80
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>keeps track of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

81
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:39.874
<v Speaker 1>Paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a ledger at the pay pal world </v>

82
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>headquarters and maybe a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>backups.</v>

83
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.013
<v Speaker 1>They keep track of how many dollars you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in your account and how many </v>

84
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:46.654
<v Speaker 1>dollars I have in my account and when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>transfer some pay pal dollars from my </v>

85
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>account to your account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they update their ledger,</v>

86
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.073
<v Speaker 1>but because they're the ones that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge of that ledger and Keeping Track </v>

87
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:56.254
<v Speaker 1>of that ledger at any point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can reverse the transaction I made </v>

88
00:03:58.671 --> 00:03:59.504
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can take all the money out of your </v>

89
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.564
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can take all the money out my </v>

90
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The irs can go to them and say,</v>

91
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>take the money out of both of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>

92
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Anything can happen at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beyond our control.</v>

93
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:09.544
<v Speaker 1>Even though we like to think of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money that's in our pay pal account as </v>

94
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:12.724
<v Speaker 1>our money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality we have to trust paypal </v>

95
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>to hold it because paypal has that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>ledger,</v>

96
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>they're at the mercy of their higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>ups,</v>

97
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:21.860
<v Speaker 1>which are the government people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin.</v>

98
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Instead of there being one ledger that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps track of who has how many bitcoins</v>

99
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>and what account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a copy of this ledger,</v>

100
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.194
<v Speaker 1>but it's on everybody's computer around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that's running a copy of the </v>

101
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin full nodes software and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of there being,</v>

102
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two or three copies,</v>

103
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.234
<v Speaker 1>there's more than 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>copies of this ledger around the world </v>

104
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.103
<v Speaker 1>and those 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>copies of the ledger all stay in sync </v>

105
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:44.224
<v Speaker 1>with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those ledgers are in every country </v>

106
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:47.644
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I send some money to you </v>

107
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>via bitcoin for something that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>government doesn't like.</v>

108
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>There's no bitcoin company that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>

109
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no bitcoin server.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can unplug.</v>

110
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 1>All they could do is arrest the two of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

111
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't stop the bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 1>network as a whole.</v>

112
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.814
<v Speaker 1>It keeps right on going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real powerful invention of </v>

113
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin is this ledger that's not on any</v>
<v Speaker 1>one computer.</v>

114
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>The ledger is distributed across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire planet,</v>

115
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>so there's no single place that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>could go to,</v>

116
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>to stop or modify it or unplug it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it off.</v>

117
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:18.154
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's so exciting about bitcoin </v>

118
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.853
<v Speaker 1>is the only way to stop it would be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn off the entire Internet in the </v>

119
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>entire world and keep it turned off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in 2017,</v>

120
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a very likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

121
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.593
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect there is some bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be an evil guy somewhere </v>

122
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>twirling his mustache going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can shut off the entire Internet,</v>

123
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

124
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.921
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

125
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully not.</v>

126
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:37.624
<v Speaker 1>Then hopefully we can build even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies to prevent bad people from </v>

127
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>turning off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world's Internet.</v>

128
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And we saw what happened when they tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

129
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:44.210
<v Speaker 1>in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.183
<v Speaker 1>previously they turned off the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just within the country and people </v>

131
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:48.004
<v Speaker 1>were instantly rioting in the streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it led to an entire revolution in </v>

132
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>that country.</v>

133
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.933
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that would happen in a lot of </v>

134
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:53.824
<v Speaker 1>countries around the world that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to turn off the internet </v>

135
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

136
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>So I'm with you understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the ledger,</v>

137
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>the information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the true information of who has what and</v>

138
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>when they have it and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that when people say we're,</v>

139
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>we're mining for Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that actually mean?</v>

140
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.923
<v Speaker 1>So this ledgers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all across the entire world gets </v>

141
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>updated once on average every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

142
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>But it's who gets to decide who gets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make that update.</v>

143
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So the way that problem was solved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these people are doing these</v>

144
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>really complicated math problems and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only way to find the answer to this math</v>

145
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.403
<v Speaker 1>problem is just to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to guess over and over and </v>

146
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:33.014
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these bitcoin mining machines are </v>

147
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>guessing millions of times a second or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more than that.</v>

148
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>And when they find whichever machine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

149
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of these around the world,</v>

150
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:42.704
<v Speaker 1>whichever machine finds the right answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this math problem is then the one </v>

151
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.184
<v Speaker 1>that's designated to be able to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next update to this worldwide bitcoin </v>

152
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.083
<v Speaker 1>ledgers than all these different nodes </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world make their update and </v>

153
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:54.960
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transactions that the,</v>

154
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.073
<v Speaker 1>the networks that the next state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then all the computer start trying to </v>

155
00:06:57.861 --> 00:06:58.694
<v Speaker 1>guess again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the benefit of finding the right </v>

156
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>answer to this solution is at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get 12 and a half bitcoins.</v>

157
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:04.784
<v Speaker 1>If your computer is the one that finds </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right solution and 12 and a half </v>

158
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins at the moment is worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 80,</v>

159
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>$80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so.</v>

160
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.983
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should mention by the way that we're </v>

161
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 1>taping this probably about two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it's going to air.</v>

162
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>So anything we say related to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific numbers,</v>

163
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to take out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

164
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.333
<v Speaker 1>They got beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know what he's talking about </v>

165
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>because it was too bright for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

166
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

167
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>and almost certainly by the time this </v>
<v Speaker 1>airs,</v>

168
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>it'll be something that I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

169
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>even if we were doing this live right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

170
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>things would be changing on the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to check live on the,</v>

171
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:35.610
<v Speaker 1>on the phone to see what the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>prices to figure it out.</v>

172
00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bitcoin is volatile.</v>

173
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.473
<v Speaker 1>But from my point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be exposed to as much of that </v>

174
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:41.444
<v Speaker 1>volatility as I possibly can because </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin allows you to send and receive </v>

175
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 1>any amount of money with anyone anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world basically for free.</v>

176
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing anybody could do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>

177
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And there's a limited supply of bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will never,</v>

178
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever be more than 21 million bitcoin.</v>

179
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>So if you stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does that work exactly?</v>

180
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Because I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll never be more than 21 yet.</v>

181
00:07:58.851 --> 00:07:59.684
<v Speaker 1>We've got all these computers that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly working to get the next </v>

182
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>solution to the mathematical equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is there a finite number of.</v>

183
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.293
<v Speaker 1>So if one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one of these computers decided to </v>

184
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.564
<v Speaker 1>give itself more than the 12 and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins that are supposed to be </v>

185
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>allocated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other computers will reject that</v>

186
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:16.911
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

187
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>that's not part of the rules of the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

188
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 1>that in our software code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So any computer that deviates from that,</v>

189
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.163
<v Speaker 1>their transactions in whatever they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do just gets rejected and </v>

190
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.313
<v Speaker 1>ignored by the rest of the network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right from day one it was programmed </v>

191
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:30.764
<v Speaker 1>into the software code that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be more than 21 million </v>

192
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are released over time.</v>

193
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>So a half of the remaining bitcoins are </v>
<v Speaker 1>released every four years.</v>

194
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.480
<v Speaker 1>So in the first four years of Bitcoins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin,</v>

195
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>10 and a half million coins were </v>
<v Speaker 1>released in the next four years,</v>

196
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>half of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the next four years,</v>

197
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 1>half of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

198
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drops by half every four years.</v>

199
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what year will they all officially we</v>

200
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:50.804
<v Speaker 1>have more than 100 years until the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bitcoins are released out into </v>

201
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:54.120
<v Speaker 1>the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

202
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

203
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not a pressing problem at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

204
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:58.344
<v Speaker 1>but what would even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't have to go too far down </v>

205
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 1>that since it's 100 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what would happen when we hit,</v>

206
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>when we hit the point that they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

207
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>does that somehow drastically changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the game is played?</v>

208
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that by that point,</v>

209
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.850
<v Speaker 1>people that are doing bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions,</v>

210
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.013
<v Speaker 1>even if they're paying a fraction of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>penny per bitcoin transaction of people </v>

211
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>are doing billions of transactions per </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

212
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.233
<v Speaker 1>those fees have a fraction of a penny </v>
<v Speaker 1>per transaction will incentivize the </v>

213
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 1>miners to continue mining.</v>

214
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And we have 100 and something years to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out to figure that out.</v>

215
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:27.414
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect there will be some other </v>

216
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's more pressing problems than,</v>

217
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:32.150
<v Speaker 1>than that one at the moments here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

218
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

219
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>so it sounds to me that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly secure.</v>

220
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:38.184
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you just talk a little bit more </v>

221
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>about the general security?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bitcoin network,</v>

223
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.283
<v Speaker 1>all these computers around the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are doing mining a more accurate </v>

224
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:46.944
<v Speaker 1>description of what they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually they're securing the bitcoin </v>

225
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:49.284
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more computers that are mining </v>

226
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:51.144
<v Speaker 1>the more secure the bitcoin network is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bitcoin network is somewhere on </v>

227
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:54.954
<v Speaker 1>the order of several thousand times more</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful now than the world's top 500 </v>

228
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:04.131
<v Speaker 1>supercomputers combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's absolutely an incredible feat of</v>

229
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:05.600
<v Speaker 1>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

230
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 1>So how do you get that kind of computing</v>
<v Speaker 1>power?</v>

231
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.153
<v Speaker 1>Like are there just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume there's farms of servers just </v>

232
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 1>like it's just someone that invested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a farm,</v>

233
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:15.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that well how it works.</v>

234
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 1>And initially it was just people at home</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their bedroom because you know,</v>

235
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:18.834
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you found a block you would get a </v>

236
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.300
<v Speaker 1>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it wasn't that excited.</v>

237
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 1>But now today when you find a block on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blockchain,</v>

238
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.631
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus dollars.</v>

240
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 1>So now it's big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big business.</v>

241
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:29.424
<v Speaker 1>So people have big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant warehouses filled with tens of </v>

242
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars of this mining </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment using,</v>

243
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:35.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of megawatts of power per,</v>

244
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 1>per location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a big,</v>

245
00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 1>big business at this point and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>still do it at home.</v>

246
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.190
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important factors though</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the cost of electricity.</v>

247
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:45.024
<v Speaker 1>So the cheaper your electricity is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more profitable your bitcoin mining </v>

248
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>can be.</v>

249
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.523
<v Speaker 1>So I assume there's some bitcoin people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably want to go into solar and </v>

250
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:52.880
<v Speaker 1>moved to Nevada or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

251
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.723
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people going around </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at buying power plants and </v>

252
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>buying hydroelectric dams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of stuff.</v>

253
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 1>It's really become a worldwide major </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry at this point.</v>

254
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to you the DNA.</v>

255
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:04.650
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to do some </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions here.</v>

256
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 1>So blockchain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is blockchain?</v>

257
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.003
<v Speaker 1>Blockchain is just a fancy name for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide ledger that's kept on </v>

258
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:11.514
<v Speaker 1>everybody's computer that's running this</v>
<v Speaker 1>copy of the software and the ledger </v>

259
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 1>stays in sync with every other copies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

260
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically what a blockchain is.</v>

261
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's called a blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that ledger.</v>

262
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.383
<v Speaker 1>It's not updated all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's updated and steps and each step or </v>

263
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:24.534
<v Speaker 1>update is a block of new information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's attached and they're all chained </v>

264
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:30.150
<v Speaker 1>together mathematically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're all in order,</v>

265
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:30.984
<v Speaker 1>so if a new block gets added to the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the blockchain on average once every </v>

266
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes and now the blockchain is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

267
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.070
<v Speaker 1>coming up on half a million blocks long </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's been going on for,</v>

268
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

269
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 1>nine years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

270
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 1>What are most people use actually using </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin for right now?</v>

271
00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Like are they using it mostly just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transfer money from person to person or.</v>

272
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I noticed actually just two days I </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought something on overstock.com</v>

273
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:56.494
<v Speaker 1>and it was the first time that I ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw on an ecommerce site that I could </v>

274
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>have paid in bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had actually never seen that before,</v>

275
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:02.494
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are most people using bitcoin for </v>

276
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.130
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends on.</v>

277
00:12:05.131 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like asking what do most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people use money for?</v>

278
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 1>An imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my book,</v>

279
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin is money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people use money in different ways.</v>

280
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Some people save with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people spend it,</v>

281
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 1>some people gamble on the Internet with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

282
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:16.264
<v Speaker 1>some people buy drugs with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people do whatever it is they want </v>

283
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my point of view,</v>

284
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.614
<v Speaker 1>each each person owns their own money </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they should be free to do whatever </v>

285
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>they want with it.</v>

286
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.920
<v Speaker 1>So long as they're not initiating force </v>
<v Speaker 1>or fraud against other people.</v>

287
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.773
<v Speaker 1>And I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what any of the trends are </v>

288
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:30.664
<v Speaker 1>like are people really at the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting into bitcoin so they can </v>

289
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 1>save it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping that,</v>

290
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating it more as a stock than an than</v>

291
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.810
<v Speaker 1>actual cash or they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

292
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Then we can also talk about a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the split with bitcoin cash do.</v>

293
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.403
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a good segue to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you have any sense of what the </v>

294
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.920
<v Speaker 1>actual habits are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

295
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's a great segue into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

296
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:48.364
<v Speaker 1>So when I first got involved in Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the first person in the entire </v>

297
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 1>world to start investing in bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 1>startups.</v>

298
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.560
<v Speaker 1>So my first step where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pause there for a second.</v>

299
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 1>This is 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

300
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are our 2011 bitcoins are less than</v>

301
00:12:59.351 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>a dollar each.</v>

302
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what possessed you to get involved?</v>

303
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Like what did you see that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

304
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:05.980
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be something.</v>

305
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.233
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

306
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.693
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in silicon valley than playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with computers since I was little kid </v>

307
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 1>love computers all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

308
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 1>and my hobby was studying economics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

309
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.143
<v Speaker 1>just kind of by chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across one economics book in </v>

310
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.680
<v Speaker 1>junior high when my mother told me I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't play anymore Nintendo.</v>

311
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I had to go and do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked up a book off the bookshelf and</v>

312
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.190
<v Speaker 1>just by luck it was a book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism by loaded.</v>

313
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Bobby says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people may know who that is and</v>

314
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.890
<v Speaker 1>what that book is and most people I </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect won't.</v>

315
00:13:36.891 --> 00:13:37.724
<v Speaker 1>And when I picked up that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a pro socialism book </v>

316
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.750
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't really even know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism was,</v>

317
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.980
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of knew that Americans were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be opposed to socialism.</v>

318
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 1>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

319
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.473
<v Speaker 1>I should have an open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should at least hear what the other </v>

320
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:52.620
<v Speaker 1>side of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.630
<v Speaker 1>this point of view has to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turned out that,</v>

322
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the Wall Street Journal </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to Mommy says book socialism is</v>

323
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.430
<v Speaker 1>loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is devastating critique of socialism.</v>

324
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 1>And in this book he kind of points out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that prices are incredibly important and</v>

325
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:11.110
<v Speaker 1>without the pricing mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what raw resources should</v>

326
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:13.810
<v Speaker 1>be used to produce what consumer goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

327
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

328
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.800
<v Speaker 1>my glass of water here is made of glass </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't know.</v>

329
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how they make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>glass,</v>

330
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 1>but I guess some sand and they melt it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down or something like that.</v>

331
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 1>But without the price that we got it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from target for the record.</v>

332
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So we spare no expense around here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

333
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.553
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with the prices that go into the </v>

334
00:14:28.241 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 1>sand and then the factory and this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

335
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:31.324
<v Speaker 1>they know that maybe they should make </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses out of sand rather than glasses </v>

336
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>out of gold or glasses out of copper or </v>
<v Speaker 1>take your pick.</v>

337
00:14:36.221 --> 00:14:37.054
<v Speaker 1>And so all the prices all over the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>allocate all of these resources and all </v>

338
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 1>of these companies and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>factories and people and individuals all</v>

339
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:45.604
<v Speaker 1>the way to the time when you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>target and you look at the different </v>

340
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:48.250
<v Speaker 1>glasses there and you think this one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>glass,</v>

341
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:49.084
<v Speaker 1>this one's plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one suits my need better than this </v>

342
00:14:50.861 --> 00:14:51.694
<v Speaker 1>one and this one cost this much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it allocates the resources of the </v>

343
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without a pricing mechanism,</v>

344
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.463
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what raw resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be used to create what consumer </v>

345
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:01.970
<v Speaker 1>goods and reading this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

346
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:02.804
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

347
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Anytime the government gets involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any area of the economy,</v>

348
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.393
<v Speaker 1>they're causing a misallocation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and resources are being </v>

349
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:10.634
<v Speaker 1>diverted from their most economically </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient use to something that's less </v>

350
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:14.774
<v Speaker 1>economically efficient and saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's less economically efficient </v>

351
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:18.494
<v Speaker 1>is just a fancier way of saying you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the world a poorer place than it </v>

352
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:21.644
<v Speaker 1>otherwise would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I found these ideas incredibly </v>

353
00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:25.510
<v Speaker 1>interesting and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it I,</v>

354
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 1>it gave me a better understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

355
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>And so I read one economics book after </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

356
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:32.260
<v Speaker 1>after another after another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>

357
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.613
<v Speaker 1>I got to read these theories about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin of money and what the origin of </v>

358
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:37.124
<v Speaker 1>money is and the idea of the origin of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money is that it starts out as a </v>

359
00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 1>commodity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just any commodity.</v>

360
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 1>It has to be commodity that's easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizable,</v>

361
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 1>easily divisible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily transportable.</v>

362
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You can store it easily for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it won't go moldy or disappeared.</v>

363
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.593
<v Speaker 1>It has to have these certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that make something as </v>

364
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:54.854
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read about these theories in the </v>

365
00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:00.040
<v Speaker 1>books and I was pretty convinced by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>

366
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.690
<v Speaker 1>and not to go down a whole nother </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangent,</v>

367
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:05.750
<v Speaker 1>but I actually did some time in federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison in the US as well.</v>

368
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And when I was in federal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got it noted right there.</v>

369
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I was in federal prison,</v>

370
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I got to see firsthand in this micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison economy that sure enough,</v>

371
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.503
<v Speaker 1>the theories in the books that I'd read </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the origin of money were true in </v>

372
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:21.644
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got to see within the prison that </v>

373
00:16:22.871 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 1>sure enough people are using commodities</v>
<v Speaker 1>as money.</v>

374
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:26.594
<v Speaker 1>So in prison people use tobacco and </v>
<v Speaker 1>postage stamps and top ramen soups as </v>

375
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:32.570
<v Speaker 1>money because all of those things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily storable,</v>

376
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 1>easily transportable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily divisible,</v>

377
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.180
<v Speaker 1>easily recognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

378
00:16:37.181 --> 00:16:39.410
<v Speaker 1>and of course a limited supply is </v>
<v Speaker 1>important as well.</v>

379
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.243
<v Speaker 1>And so I got to see firsthand before my </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes that the theories that I had read </v>

380
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 1>about in the books are actually true in </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

381
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.610
<v Speaker 1>And then bitcoin came along and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin and I knew from the theories and</v>

382
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:53.444
<v Speaker 1>the books and from the practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and the empirical evidence I </v>

383
00:16:56.361 --> 00:16:57.194
<v Speaker 1>had from the prison economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew people were going to start using </v>

384
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:01.364
<v Speaker 1>it as money and because the supply of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin was limited and I knew people </v>

385
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.080
<v Speaker 1>were going to start using it as money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meant the price of bitcoin in terms</v>

386
00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:09.914
<v Speaker 1>of dollars would have to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my first step was to buy a bunch of </v>

387
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.110
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin and my next step was to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>building that.</v>

388
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to interrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at that early stage,</v>

389
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:17.751
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

390
00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:18.584
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you actually even buying it from </v>

391
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:20.870
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

392
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>So this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think February of 2011.</v>

393
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.770
<v Speaker 1>And so there wasn't really an easy way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy bitcoin at that point.</v>

394
00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no coinbase,</v>

395
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.580
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't much of anything other than</v>

396
00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:32.414
<v Speaker 1>this one company called Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gox and it wasn't really much of a </v>

397
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:37.004
<v Speaker 1>company at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sent my first wire to a person's </v>

398
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:40.424
<v Speaker 1>personal bank account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Jed mccaleb to his personal </v>

399
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 1>bank account in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got my first big ones in there.</v>

400
00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:46.994
<v Speaker 1>And then in parallel I was trying to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins from another guy off the </v>

401
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Internet for anybody who's been around </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Bitcoin for a while,</v>

402
00:17:51.611 --> 00:17:54.110
<v Speaker 1>they may have seen the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] sassiest bitcoins.</v>

403
00:17:54.111 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 1>So the guy behind that was also nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to send me some bitcoins.</v>

404
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 1>And so one time there was actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical there.</v>

405
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:00.933
<v Speaker 1>There still are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're more of a collector's item </v>

406
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:02.670
<v Speaker 1>at this point.</v>

407
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 1>And basically it's a physical coin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Hologram.</v>

408
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And when you peel a hologram off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that it's been tampered with</v>

409
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 1>and underneath the Hologram is the magic</v>
<v Speaker 1>number that's required to actually spend</v>

410
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 1>the bitcoins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

411
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.663
<v Speaker 1>do they start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they still do make those or maybe </v>

412
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:17.934
<v Speaker 1>someone somewhere still making them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was the reason just because at </v>

413
00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:21.594
<v Speaker 1>the beginning people needed some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical representation just to kind of </v>

414
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:24.954
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the main reason is it made it </v>

415
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 1>easier for people to get a hold of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin.</v>

416
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:29.814
<v Speaker 1>So I'm one of the main things that I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really help spread a bitcoin </v>

417
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.210
<v Speaker 1>adoption in the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2012,</v>

418
00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it was when bitcoins were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>three bucks each.</v>

419
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>I started selling these physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins and I accepted credit cards and</v>

420
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:45.660
<v Speaker 1>pay pal and I would ship them via Fedex </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had proof of delivery.</v>

421
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So it made it hard for people to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card charge backs or that sort of</v>

422
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:49.464
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we saw thousands and thousands of </v>

423
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 1>these physical bitcoins to people all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world that way.</v>

424
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.773
<v Speaker 1>And it was an easy way for people to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>their first bitcoin because then they </v>

425
00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:57.984
<v Speaker 1>could peel off the sticker and redeemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>them onto their computer or do whatever </v>

426
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 1>they wanted with them from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

427
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.353
<v Speaker 1>today they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're quite the collector's items </v>

428
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:05.334
<v Speaker 1>because there's not too many left of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those early [inaudible] CSF physical </v>

429
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:08.200
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

430
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.791
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

431
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:09.624
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make this initial investment in </v>

432
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:12.780
<v Speaker 1>2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012.</v>

433
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.430
<v Speaker 1>When did you start to realize that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really was becoming something?</v>

434
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 1>And as we speak right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Bitcoin is basically at its highest</v>

435
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.910
<v Speaker 1>value of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all time in effect.</v>

436
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

437
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I knew from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from day one,</v>

438
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:29.400
<v Speaker 1>once I put together the pieces in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and I understood that bitcoin could</v>

439
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.263
<v Speaker 1>be shut down or stopped or controlled in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any way and that there's a limited </v>

440
00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:33.954
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>

441
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I was so excited about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

442
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:38.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard about it.</v>

443
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 1>And as I was eating breakfast at around </v>
<v Speaker 1>10:00</v>

444
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.740
<v Speaker 1>AM with the full intent of going into my</v>
<v Speaker 1>office that day didn't make it.</v>

445
00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I stayed home and read about bitcoin all</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

446
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I stayed up all night the next day until</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 4:00</v>

447
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.130
<v Speaker 1>PM the next day and I got too tired and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I fell asleep for only about an hour and</v>

448
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:53.964
<v Speaker 1>then woke up again and read all about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin and I went on sleeping maybe an </v>

449
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.750
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half per night for about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole week until I got so sick from lack</v>

450
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:04.130
<v Speaker 1>of sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to call my friends,</v>

451
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.500
<v Speaker 1>help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sick and he came and picked me up</v>

452
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:08.334
<v Speaker 1>and drove me to the hospital and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me some sort of a sedative or </v>

453
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:11.664
<v Speaker 1>something and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I passed out asleep for maybe 12 or 16 </v>

454
00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.613
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then woke up again and it was all </v>

455
00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:17.394
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin and here we are about seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>years later and it's been all bitcoin </v>

456
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.933
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day for seven years now because </v>

457
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Speaker 1>this is literally.</v>

458
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.113
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>inventions in the entire history of </v>

459
00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:26.754
<v Speaker 1>humankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right up there on par with the </v>

460
00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 1>importance of the invention of the wheel</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the electricity or the transistor.</v>

461
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 1>That's how big of a deal the invention </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bitcoin is.</v>

462
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.500
<v Speaker 1>So I want to get into that and how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can sort of,</v>

463
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.423
<v Speaker 1>why you really believe this can change </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we deal with borders and </v>

464
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:45.090
<v Speaker 1>societies and nations and wars and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this a bit.</v>

465
00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 1>But let's just circle back quickly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

466
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.120
<v Speaker 1>The split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bitcoin cash,</v>

467
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.010
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

468
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 1>So when I first got excited about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin,</v>

469
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:54.454
<v Speaker 1>you could send and receive any amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin with anyone anywhere in the </v>

470
00:20:56.081 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 1>world and it was free most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the times it wasn't for you.</v>

471
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:01.743
<v Speaker 1>Pay a fraction of a penny and that led </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin from being worth almost nothing </v>

472
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 1>to this worldwide phenomenon that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

473
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.483
<v Speaker 1>but much more recently within the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year to a bunch of people that don't </v>

474
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:13.504
<v Speaker 1>have any background in economics or or </v>
<v Speaker 1>in business seem to think that people </v>

475
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:18.244
<v Speaker 1>will use bitcoin solely as a store of </v>
<v Speaker 1>value even if it costs tens or hundreds </v>

476
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:24.850
<v Speaker 1>or thousands of dollars to send bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one person to another.</v>

477
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 1>And so they've intentionally undermine </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin's usefulness in commerce.</v>

478
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 1>So bitcoin on August first split into </v>
<v Speaker 1>two versions of Bitcoin,</v>

479
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 1>there's now a bitcoin segwit and bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 1>cash.</v>

480
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Speaker 1>The bitcoin cash version of bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 1>still has fees are less than a penny you</v>

481
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:41.860
<v Speaker 1>can send and receive them with anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in the world,</v>

482
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin segwit.</v>

483
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:45.334
<v Speaker 1>Now the average fee is about $10 a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a bitcoin transaction on the way </v>

484
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:49.504
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

485
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 1>in fact I was sin sending my bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 1>segwit bitcoins to a bitcoin exchange to</v>

486
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:54.784
<v Speaker 1>buy more bitcoin cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin's the fee for me to send those </v>

487
00:21:57.431 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins for my computer to the bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange with $100.</v>

488
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 1>And so if you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have two versions of bitcoin and one</v>

489
00:22:04.931 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 1>is slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive and unreliable bitcoin segwit,</v>

490
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.200
<v Speaker 1>and you have another version of bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's super fast,</v>

491
00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:13.520
<v Speaker 1>reliable and cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the type to say,</v>

492
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:14.363
<v Speaker 1>and that's bitcoin cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a tough decision as to which </v>

493
00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 1>one people are going to start using it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in commerce.</v>

494
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 1>But these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

495
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.560
<v Speaker 1>So I might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be a little confused here.</v>

496
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:23.050
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm telling you that I have two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half Bitcoin,</v>

497
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say bitcoin and Segwit,</v>

498
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original,</v>

499
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:28.084
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

500
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's debatable as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

501
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.230
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on when you received those two</v>

502
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:34.180
<v Speaker 1>and a half bitcoins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was probably from a bunch of people</v>

503
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however many bitcoins you had on August,</v>

504
00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:37.984
<v Speaker 1>first of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you now have that many bitcoin cash as </v>

505
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:40.624
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you had two bitcoins </v>

506
00:22:41.921 --> 00:22:42.820
<v Speaker 1>exactly on August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

507
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you now have two bitcoins and into </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin cash.</v>

508
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I believe you said that you </v>

509
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:49.810
<v Speaker 1>were holding your bitcoins on coinbase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

510
00:22:49.811 --> 00:22:53.410
<v Speaker 1>And as we were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show base is a fantastic company,</v>

511
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a bitcoin wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit coin bank and they're holding</v>

512
00:22:57.761 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 1>the bitcoins on your behalf and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're holding the bitcoin cash on your</v>

513
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 1>behalf.</v>

514
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.583
<v Speaker 1>And so you're going to have to wait for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to get around to giving you access </v>

515
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>to their bitcoin cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think they will.</v>

516
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.013
<v Speaker 1>But if you were using a bit coin wallet </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which you're holding the bitcoins </v>

517
00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:11.074
<v Speaker 1>yourself on your own device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have access to your bitcoin </v>

518
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:15.010
<v Speaker 1>cash right there from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean?</v>

519
00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't have access to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was to right now,</v>

520
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:18.634
<v Speaker 1>log in and I got to do all that stuff on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my phone and all of the password </v>

521
00:23:20.621 --> 00:23:21.454
<v Speaker 1>craziness and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy that you have to do all </v>

522
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:23.794
<v Speaker 1>those things obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean I don't have access to </v>

523
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:26.824
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only have access to the bitcoin </v>

524
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 1>segwit version of bitcoin on coinbase </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

525
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.173
<v Speaker 1>They've promised to give everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to their bitcoin cash at some </v>

526
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.470
<v Speaker 1>point and hopefully they'll do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner rather than later.</v>

527
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.303
<v Speaker 1>But August first was a couple of months </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago now and they still haven't gotten </v>

528
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:41.140
<v Speaker 1>around to doing it and I'm confident </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they will,</v>

529
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:43.443
<v Speaker 1>but it's nice to have access to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>money now and not have to wait around </v>

530
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 1>for somebody else to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's very important.</v>

531
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 1>And I always tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a bitcoin wallet,</v>

532
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.013
<v Speaker 1>not a Bitcoin Bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why wouldn't everyone want bitcoin </v>

533
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:55.500
<v Speaker 1>cash though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless I'm missing something.</v>

534
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone is going to want </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin cash.</v>

535
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 1>There's book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what was the logic?</v>

536
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:01.514
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the reason everyone's not using </v>

537
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:03.194
<v Speaker 1>it yet is that this bitcoin Seibert </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of bitcoin managed to bring </v>

538
00:24:08.861 --> 00:24:09.694
<v Speaker 1>along all of the existing infrastructure</v>
<v Speaker 1>in bitcoin that's been around for nine </v>

539
00:24:13.571 --> 00:24:15.220
<v Speaker 1>years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years now.</v>

540
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin cash has only been around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of months since August first,</v>

541
00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:23.440
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that bitcoin cash is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported on the bitcoin.com</v>

542
00:24:23.441 --> 00:24:24.274
<v Speaker 1>wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supported in the blockchain dot </v>

543
00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Info Wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a coin base as public as they said,</v>

544
00:24:27.491 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 1>they're going to support it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

545
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.793
<v Speaker 1>it's supported in the bitpay wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting more and more support from </v>

546
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.680
<v Speaker 1>wallets and merchant processors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchanges.</v>

547
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:35.523
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a matter of time when </v>

548
00:24:36.581 --> 00:24:37.414
<v Speaker 1>people are faced between a fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap and reliable version of bitcoin </v>

549
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's super slow and expensive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreliable version of bitcoin.</v>

550
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.313
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the argument from the slow </v>

551
00:24:45.581 --> 00:24:46.414
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that don't agree with you on </v>

552
00:24:47.591 --> 00:24:49.030
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the actual argument?</v>

553
00:24:49.031 --> 00:24:52.420
<v Speaker 1>If we're really just talking about slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeds and a clunkier process,</v>

554
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.970
<v Speaker 1>obviously that doesn't sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to have fast,</v>

555
00:24:54.971 --> 00:24:56.980
<v Speaker 1>cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable transactions on Bitcoin,</v>

556
00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.890
<v Speaker 1>it requires a more expensive computer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>run a full node,</v>

557
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but the vast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vast,</v>

558
00:25:01.511 --> 00:25:04.360
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of bitcoin users aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>running a full note anyhow.</v>

559
00:25:04.361 --> 00:25:07.840
<v Speaker 1>You've probably never run a full node in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your entire life and nobody,</v>

560
00:25:07.841 --> 00:25:08.674
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of these coin based users are </v>

561
00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:10.024
<v Speaker 1>running a full node.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coinbase runs a number of full notes to </v>

562
00:25:11.411 --> 00:25:14.320
<v Speaker 1>support your bitcoin transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have</v>

563
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.513
<v Speaker 1>the bitcoin cash version will require </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger blocks which require a more </v>

564
00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:23.880
<v Speaker 1>powerful CPU and more storage space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now today you can run a bitcoin</v>

565
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 1>full node for the Bitcoin segwit </v>
<v Speaker 1>version,</v>

566
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.110
<v Speaker 1>literally on a $25 raspberry Pi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are ready to take.</v>

567
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.003
<v Speaker 1>What is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Raspberry Pi is a $25 computer and </v>

568
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the name of the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a cup.</v>

569
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

570
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.400
<v Speaker 1>there's an actual competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are another thing on pies now.</v>

571
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.423
<v Speaker 1>But wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a computer called the raspberry </v>

572
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Pi I to the number of acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see there's a lot of terms here.</v>

573
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>We're running this thing on cakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

574
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 1>So you can run the Bitcoin segwit </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of Bitcoin on a $25 computer.</v>

575
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin cash today can still run under </v>
<v Speaker 1>$25 computer,</v>

576
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 1>but in the future as bitcoin cash </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more popular,</v>

577
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.283
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll take $100 computer or even a</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 or even a thousand or a couple </v>

578
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:05.780
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollar computer at some at some</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

579
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.303
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people aren't running full nodes </v>

580
00:26:08.271 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 1>anyhow and if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you caught it cost five or 10 or $100</v>

581
00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:16.910
<v Speaker 1>to use bitcoin segwit and it cost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>penny to use bitcoin cash.</v>

582
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.080
<v Speaker 1>It's clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were,</v>

583
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you've been accepting donations on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

584
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.433
<v Speaker 1>I think you got most of those donations </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the price of bitcoin transaction </v>

585
00:26:24.841 --> 00:26:25.674
<v Speaker 1>skyrocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason the price of Bitcoin </v>

586
00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:27.344
<v Speaker 1>segwit transactions skyrocket is there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>one megabyte worth of transactions that </v>

587
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 1>can happen each 10 minute period that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can hold about 2000 bitcoin transactions</v>

588
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.850
<v Speaker 1>in the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 people were using bitcoin every</v>

589
00:26:37.851 --> 00:26:38.684
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could do it for free and your </v>

590
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:41.144
<v Speaker 1>transaction will be included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that bitcoin is this worldwide </v>

591
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:44.394
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 2000 people are trying to use </v>

592
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:47.304
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin every 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want your transaction to be </v>

593
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:50.214
<v Speaker 1>included in the blockchain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if more than 2000 people are trying </v>

594
00:26:51.961 --> 00:26:52.794
<v Speaker 1>to use every 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to bid against each other and </v>

595
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:56.184
<v Speaker 1>the top bidders are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>included in the next block on the </v>

596
00:26:58.141 --> 00:26:58.530
<v Speaker 1>blockchain.</v>

597
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:03.530
<v Speaker 1>So now the fees are about $10 per per </v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction because anybody that pays $9</v>

598
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.120
<v Speaker 1>has been outbid by the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying $10.</v>

599
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 1>So bitcoin cash a solution to that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

600
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Just make the blocks bigger than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>megabyte.</v>

601
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:11.484
<v Speaker 1>It's 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight terabyte hard drive is about 100 </v>

602
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 1>bucks at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they're only going to get cheaper</v>

603
00:27:17.161 --> 00:27:17.994
<v Speaker 1>year after year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're feeling basically is that the </v>

604
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:20.664
<v Speaker 1>technology will always sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computing power that we need for this </v>

605
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 1>will always sort of stay in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

606
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.303
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just because it keeps getting faster </v>

607
00:27:27.221 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 1>and there's this great thing called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moore's law,</v>

608
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:32.190
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That computing power doubles about every</v>

609
00:27:32.191 --> 00:27:37.191
<v Speaker 1>18 months and so if a eight terabyte </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard drive today is $100 in a year and a</v>

610
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.303
<v Speaker 1>half from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be about $50 and a year </v>

611
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:40.780
<v Speaker 1>half after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

612
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.580
<v Speaker 1>$25.</v>

613
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.413
<v Speaker 1>And before you know what their garbage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the landfill and people laugh at a </v>

614
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:46.950
<v Speaker 1>eight terabyte hard drive the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd laugh.</v>

615
00:27:46.951 --> 00:27:47.784
<v Speaker 1>I bet eight megabyte hard drive today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember eight megabyte hard </v>

616
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 1>drives and I remember when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>several hundred dollars and I'm not that</v>

617
00:27:53.521 --> 00:27:56.640
<v Speaker 1>old of a guy in the same as going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to happen with computers.</v>

618
00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Before we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned the window before.</v>

619
00:27:58.891 --> 00:27:59.724
<v Speaker 1>I remember when the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was four megabyte game came </v>

620
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:05.000
<v Speaker 1>out on Sega Genesis and it's big deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were going.</v>

621
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.040
<v Speaker 1>People were going completely bananas </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

622
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.440
<v Speaker 1>That is many lifetimes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

623
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 1>just real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's circle back to this,</v>

624
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.200
<v Speaker 1>to this Wallet Verse Bank Thing Because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

625
00:28:13.201 --> 00:28:14.034
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe I could be a little clearer </v>

626
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:16.134
<v Speaker 1>on what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So coinbase as a bank is really just </v>

627
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 1>holding my bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were,</v>

628
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.803
<v Speaker 1>if I had this in a wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's actually part of the actual </v>

629
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:25.910
<v Speaker 1>blockchain right here.</v>

630
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.053
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't in a bitcoin wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interfacing directly with the </v>

631
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 1>actual bitcoin network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when you use a bitcoin bank like</v>

632
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.073
<v Speaker 1>coinbase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interfacing with coinbase and </v>

633
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:35.544
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please broadcast my transaction to the </v>

634
00:28:36.991 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin network and most of the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>

635
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.850
<v Speaker 1>but like your bitcoin cash at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

636
00:28:41.851 --> 00:28:42.684
<v Speaker 1>you don't have access to it and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually recommend that on your website </v>

637
00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:45.564
<v Speaker 1>you should put a bitcoin cash address up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there because right now people want to </v>

638
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:48.864
<v Speaker 1>tip you in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin is going to cost them five or </v>

639
00:28:50.431 --> 00:28:51.264
<v Speaker 1>$10 in network fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they wanted to give you a dollar </v>

640
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.593
<v Speaker 1>in Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to pay six or $11 </v>

641
00:28:56.641 --> 00:28:57.474
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think too many people are </v>

642
00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:00.900
<v Speaker 1>going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These don't seem like the type of people</v>

643
00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:01.734
<v Speaker 1>that would make sense to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if they want it to tip you in </v>

644
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:04.044
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a dollar they'll have to send a </v>

645
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:06.204
<v Speaker 1>dollar and a penny and that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerable to people and I'm more than </v>

646
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 1>happy after we record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you this bitcoin cash.</v>

647
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say,</v>

648
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:12.124
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got my own farm out their servers </v>

649
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:13.914
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to fiddle around with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then why would someone use a bank </v>

650
00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:17.604
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they just didn't understand the </v>

651
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like yourself.</v>

652
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.293
<v Speaker 1>I think you didn't realize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between coinbase and a real </v>

653
00:29:22.651 --> 00:29:25.230
<v Speaker 1>big coin wallet until now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

654
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.083
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think we did a pretty decent job </v>

655
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:28.434
<v Speaker 1>there of the little stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like we basically got the </v>

656
00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:31.764
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I missing something on the one one </v>

657
00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.310
<v Speaker 1>for anybody that feels like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing anything on the [inaudible],</v>

658
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:36.303
<v Speaker 1>go go to bitcoin dot Khan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit biased because that's </v>

659
00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:40.110
<v Speaker 1>my website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fantastic resource.</v>

660
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Get a bitcoin wallet and start using</v>

661
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.330
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like email.</v>

662
00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 2>If you'd never actually used email and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you only heard people discuss the show,</v>

663
00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 2>it would seem hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you've used it,</v>

664
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:51.110
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same with bitcoin.</v>

665
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.993
<v Speaker 2>So go and actually use it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and use it with bitcoin cash because it </v>

666
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:55.204
<v Speaker 2>won't cost you $5 each time you use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll cost you less than a penny each </v>

667
00:29:57.821 --> 00:29:59.200
<v Speaker 2>time you make a transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

668
00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:00.970
<v Speaker 2>so the part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so shifting from all that,</v>

669
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:01.804
<v Speaker 2>the part of this that I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting beyond just the </v>

670
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:04.954
<v Speaker 2>financial discussion and just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the future of commerce is going </v>

671
00:30:08.631 --> 00:30:09.464
<v Speaker 2>to work and all that is you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that bitcoin can change the way </v>

672
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 2>governments act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

673
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.400
<v Speaker 2>the way we as individuals respond to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

674
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:20.290
<v Speaker 2>and talk to our governments and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

675
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.373
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm giving you a sort of a broad </v>

676
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:23.360
<v Speaker 2>question there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

677
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.273
<v Speaker 2>tell me about that.</v>

678
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.133
<v Speaker 2>I hear people asking me all the time or </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't is going to regulate bitcoin and </v>

679
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:29.960
<v Speaker 2>what about government regulation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin?</v>

680
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.200
<v Speaker 2>But I think they're asking the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

681
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:33.034
<v Speaker 2>The real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real end game here is isn't that </v>

682
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.490
<v Speaker 2>governments are going to regulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

683
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin is going to regulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>

684
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.833
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin is going to limit the power that</v>
<v Speaker 2>every government on the planet has to </v>

685
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:44.554
<v Speaker 2>control people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A look at what happened a few years ago </v>

686
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:48.490
<v Speaker 2>in Cyprus where every single person </v>
<v Speaker 2>there had,</v>

687
00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big percentage of their bank account </v>

688
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:52.143
<v Speaker 2>just completely wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin gives the ability to people to </v>

689
00:30:55.151 --> 00:30:58.240
<v Speaker 2>opt out of that sort of system in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States here,</v>

690
00:30:58.241 --> 00:30:59.074
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government can print as much money </v>

691
00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:01.354
<v Speaker 2>at any time for any reason and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>better believe that they're doing that </v>

692
00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:06.940
<v Speaker 2>all the time if you're using bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sort of thing can happen.</v>

693
00:31:06.941 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And one of these really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that had never occurred to me when</v>

694
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:10.781
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

695
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:11.614
<v Speaker 2>going on my binge ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any economics books as a kid was a by </v>

696
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:19.021
<v Speaker 2>Milton Friedman and he pointed out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of bracket creep and the government</v>

697
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 2>inflates the currency every single year.</v>

698
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.120
<v Speaker 2>So maybe having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

699
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 2>two or three percent inflation and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

700
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:26.560
<v Speaker 2>you're one year to the next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not that big of a deal,</v>

701
00:31:26.561 --> 00:31:28.780
<v Speaker 2>but compounding year after year after </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

702
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 2>before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$100,000</v>

703
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.270
<v Speaker 2>isn't intended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 20 years from now,</v>

704
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:36.180
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna be that big of an income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

705
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.100
<v Speaker 2>But the government tax brackets are </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to stay about the same.</v>

706
00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:39.934
<v Speaker 2>So maybe $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>income today is the equivalent of </v>

707
00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:43.294
<v Speaker 2>$100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your income after however many years it </v>

708
00:31:45.341 --> 00:31:47.680
<v Speaker 2>takes to compound to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of being in a,</v>

709
00:31:47.681 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 percent tax bracket,</v>

710
00:31:49.361 --> 00:31:50.194
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be in a 45 percent tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>bracket even though you're not actually </v>

711
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:56.290
<v Speaker 2>earning any more money each year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin is the exact opposite of that.</v>

712
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:57.124
<v Speaker 2>There's no central authority that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make more bitcoins out of thin air </v>

713
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.453
<v Speaker 2>unlike the US dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a really powerful way of </v>

714
00:32:02.141 --> 00:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>people to opt out of this government </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflation racket that they had that they</v>

715
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 2>used to bump everybody into higher tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>brackets year after year.</v>

716
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of,</v>

717
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:13.150
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of hard to picture what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>would actually look like in the future.</v>

718
00:32:13.151 --> 00:32:13.984
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everything you're predicting and </v>

719
00:32:15.281 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 2>would like to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

720
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:17.883
<v Speaker 2>even effect as the years go by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will obviously be buying more </v>

721
00:32:21.611 --> 00:32:25.290
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin using the US dollar in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>country they're in,</v>

722
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.283
<v Speaker 2>whatever their currencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna use that less and that </v>

723
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 2>that vary by just doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The governments will in effect have less</v>

724
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:36.730
<v Speaker 2>control over the people because all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

725
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.133
<v Speaker 2>all of your interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of your exchanges will have nothing </v>

726
00:32:40.401 --> 00:32:41.234
<v Speaker 2>to do with the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Sam grinning from ear to ear as </v>

727
00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 2>someone who's this white is in Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is illegal in China?</v>

728
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:47.354
<v Speaker 2>Or are they just changed something or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't there something just in the last </v>

729
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.480
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've changed a lot of things in,</v>

730
00:32:51.481 --> 00:32:52.314
<v Speaker 2>in China at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day it doesn't </v>

731
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.720
<v Speaker 2>matter if you have access to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

732
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 2>you can use bitcoin and this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

733
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 2>really exciting.</v>

734
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's worth pointing out too,</v>

735
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:05.560
<v Speaker 2>like I wasn't born a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

736
00:33:05.561 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really have any political views</v>

737
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the more economics I studied,</v>

738
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.043
<v Speaker 2>the more of a libertarian I became and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it was kind of really depressing </v>

739
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>because I looked around the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments are manipulating the economy</v>

740
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:18.524
<v Speaker 2>and all these ways that are preventing </v>
<v Speaker 2>or slowing down the entire world's rate </v>

741
00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:24.850
<v Speaker 2>of economic growth and economic growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

742
00:33:24.851 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.750
<v Speaker 2>two or three or four percent per year </v>
<v Speaker 2>from one year to the next.</v>

744
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:30.584
<v Speaker 2>That's not that big of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but compounded year after year after </v>

745
00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:34.310
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really makes a huge,</v>

746
00:33:34.311 --> 00:33:35.144
<v Speaker 2>huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even if the government is just </v>

747
00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:37.484
<v Speaker 2>slowing down the rate of economic growth</v>
<v Speaker 2>by just one percent and I think it's </v>

748
00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:40.484
<v Speaker 2>substantially more than that compound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that times 100 or a couple of hundred </v>

749
00:33:43.461 --> 00:33:44.294
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd all have flying cars and space </v>

750
00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:48.800
<v Speaker 2>stations by now and be living forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of little nano technology.</v>

751
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.633
<v Speaker 2>Robots that can go on our body and fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's wrong with us and who </v>

752
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:54.620
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't want it,</v>

753
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 2>don't participate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not forced to participate.</v>

754
00:33:56.811 --> 00:33:57.644
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were slowing down the rate of progress </v>

755
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:01.244
<v Speaker 2>of all of humankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And bitcoin is this incredibly powerful </v>

756
00:34:04.161 --> 00:34:06.200
<v Speaker 2>tool to help speed up that rate of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

757
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.293
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different ways I could </v>

758
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:09.500
<v Speaker 2>go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

759
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.640
<v Speaker 2>so the dystopian future part of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I guess I would fear is that if,</v>

760
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.450
<v Speaker 2>if the government loses control of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>monetary system,</v>

761
00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:18.284
<v Speaker 2>all the governments whose control and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way they can stop us now is to </v>

762
00:34:21.111 --> 00:34:21.944
<v Speaker 2>go after the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't it stand to reason that </v>

763
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:26.090
<v Speaker 2>governments would start going after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet?</v>

764
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 2>They're like literally the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

765
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Speaker 2>like actually try to disconnect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet,</v>

766
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:31.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe whatever that.</v>

767
00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.040
<v Speaker 2>But lots of governments are dependent on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet as well.</v>

768
00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:37.970
<v Speaker 2>But there's also lots of smart people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are building these mesh networks in</v>

769
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:38.804
<v Speaker 2>which it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not dependent on the same sort of </v>

770
00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:43.550
<v Speaker 2>centralized infrastructure that allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet is today.</v>

771
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:44.683
<v Speaker 2>And those technologies are only going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get more and more powerful and cheaper </v>

772
00:34:47.241 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 2>and cheaper and cheaper thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moore's law.</v>

773
00:34:49.341 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 2>And before we know it will all be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to connect with everybody else.</v>

774
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:54.270
<v Speaker 2>And we won't be dependent on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.870
<v Speaker 2>these big esps and how do they go about </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

776
00:34:56.871 --> 00:34:59.540
<v Speaker 2>like a mesh network like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically in effect,</v>

777
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:02.390
<v Speaker 2>getting us off Google and verizon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever else,</v>

778
00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:03.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that,</v>

779
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.093
<v Speaker 2>those won't be the only pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do these guys get out of that </v>

780
00:35:06.081 --> 00:35:06.890
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

781
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:07.723
<v Speaker 2>well I think we're of a similar age and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure both of us remember before </v>

782
00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:11.504
<v Speaker 2>there were smartphones and before there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were iphones and before there was Siri </v>

783
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:14.570
<v Speaker 2>and Google and all these things.</v>

784
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:15.403
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now you have the entire database of </v>

785
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:20.480
<v Speaker 2>human knowledge right in your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you buy a used iphone,</v>

786
00:35:20.481 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you can get it for about a hundred bucks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another couple of years that's going</v>

787
00:35:23.751 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 2>to buy a cheap android phone for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks right now.</v>

788
00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>

789
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 2>So the hardware to do this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get cheaper and cheaper.</v>

790
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 2>The technology is going to become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more accessible.</v>

791
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.463
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be cheaper and cheaper for </v>

792
00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:38.630
<v Speaker 2>anybody to put satellites up in space </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe government,</v>

793
00:35:38.631 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 2>you're going to try and stop this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

794
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.063
<v Speaker 2>do bad things to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they start trying to shut down </v>

795
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:46.170
<v Speaker 2>the world's Internet to prevent people </v>
<v Speaker 2>from using their own money,</v>

796
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.050
<v Speaker 2>that's just a fantastic example that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government people are the bad people and</v>

797
00:35:50.051 --> 00:35:51.840
<v Speaker 2>they're not our friends and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>here to help us.</v>

798
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that's here trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

799
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 2>we're going to turn off the Internet if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you use money without our permission.</v>

800
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Those are bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't support them.</v>

801
00:35:59.311 --> 00:36:00.690
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't want anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

802
00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:03.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's just more proof that we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>need bitcoin to opt out of there.</v>

803
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 2>They're violent curse of system to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control us all.</v>

804
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:09.900
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't be their tax cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>livestock.</v>

805
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a great sell for libertarianism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

806
00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Like if mean this is what I am always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

807
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.670
<v Speaker 2>selling the ideas of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you think people,</v>

808
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.710
<v Speaker 2>everyone complains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government's horrible all the time.</v>

809
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:20.723
<v Speaker 2>You have half the people want to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>them more money and give them more </v>

810
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:22.681
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

811
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:24.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the opposite.</v>

812
00:36:24.241 --> 00:36:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't starve them,</v>

813
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:27.510
<v Speaker 2>but let's try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's try it that way.</v>

814
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.170
<v Speaker 2>So I think I'm follow the logic here.</v>

815
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.160
<v Speaker 2>So when you talk about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why this would basically stop wars to do</v>

816
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:35.994
<v Speaker 2>you mean because of economic reasons or </v>
<v Speaker 2>because basically we wouldn't be giving </v>

817
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.133
<v Speaker 2>the economic reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning countries wouldn't have an </v>

818
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:42.803
<v Speaker 2>economic incentive to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also that the people wouldn't be </v>

819
00:36:44.671 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 2>giving them enough money to fight in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

820
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a couple of reasons.</v>

821
00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since we have quite a big audience,</v>

822
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I've never talked about one of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly,</v>

823
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 2>a really up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will they think about that one too?</v>

824
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:56.650
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's throw one of,</v>

825
00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.513
<v Speaker 2>one of the easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple reasons is that lots of </v>

826
00:36:59.131 --> 00:37:01.650
<v Speaker 2>governments fund their wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inflation.</v>

827
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:02.903
<v Speaker 2>They just print money and they use that </v>
<v Speaker 2>money to buy guns and bombs and tanks </v>

828
00:37:05.461 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 2>and they use it to murder people all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world.</v>

829
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And a war is just a euphemism for </v>
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>

830
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

831
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.500
<v Speaker 2>you're killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes some bad people get killed,</v>

832
00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:14.334
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innocent civilians are getting killed </v>

833
00:37:16.351 --> 00:37:17.184
<v Speaker 2>all over the world and let's say </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody came in here and stole my </v>

834
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:20.580
<v Speaker 2>wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran off down the street.</v>

835
00:37:20.581 --> 00:37:23.330
<v Speaker 2>If I started chasing them down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street and shooting guns and I,</v>

836
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I shot a dozen innocent people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't steal my wallet.</v>

837
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

838
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.713
<v Speaker 2>it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was trying to get the bad guy </v>

839
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:31.480
<v Speaker 2>who stole my wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go to jail for being a murder,</v>

840
00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:35.010
<v Speaker 2>for killing all those incident people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say let's take for granted.</v>

841
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Let's say Saddam Hussein was a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad guy who deserved to be killed.</v>

842
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 2>They murdered more than half a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraqi children to do it.</v>

843
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's murder.</v>

844
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:46.260
<v Speaker 2>You're killing kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

845
00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter how bad of a Guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saddam Hussein is.</v>

846
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't go and kill a bunch of kids to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them,</v>

847
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.330
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly what the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States government did,</v>

848
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.720
<v Speaker 2>and if any individual did that trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch a common thief,</v>

849
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.980
<v Speaker 2>you would go to jail for it.</v>

850
00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.813
<v Speaker 2>But for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just have amnesia or a closed </v>

851
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:04.650
<v Speaker 2>eyes when when governments do the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>

852
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:05.484
<v Speaker 2>if you're murdering innocent people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a murderer and that's what </v>

853
00:38:08.221 --> 00:38:09.054
<v Speaker 2>governments do and they do it primarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>through printing money and use that to </v>

854
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:12.924
<v Speaker 2>pay people to go and drop these bombs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and guns and tanks and bitcoin takes </v>

855
00:38:15.841 --> 00:38:20.841
<v Speaker 2>that power away from them because if the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end game is to have bitcoin replaced</v>

856
00:38:21.271 --> 00:38:24.420
<v Speaker 2>the dollar of place to your place placed</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and when I'm saying Bitcoin to Dan,</v>

857
00:38:24.421 --> 00:38:26.420
<v Speaker 2>referring to bitcoin cash to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

858
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.193
<v Speaker 2>but replace all those things and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes away government's ability to </v>

859
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:31.014
<v Speaker 2>inflate the currency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay for all these things and people </v>

860
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:34.380
<v Speaker 2>maybe sometimes they worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

861
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:37.300
<v Speaker 2>what about schools and roads and bridges</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hospitals?</v>

862
00:38:37.301 --> 00:38:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love schools.</v>

863
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 2>They love hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love roads and bridges.</v>

864
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.123
<v Speaker 2>Things that people like people will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than willing to pay for </v>

865
00:38:43.781 --> 00:38:44.614
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in paying to drop </v>

866
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 2>bombs on people in countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to an I'm probably never</v>

867
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 2>going to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think 99 percent of the people out</v>

868
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:53.710
<v Speaker 2>there in the world also are interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in doing that.</v>

869
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:55.540
<v Speaker 2>And for the one percent that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in doing it,</v>

870
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 2>do that with your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't force me to participate.</v>

871
00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other really,</v>

872
00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 2>really interesting way that I've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever spoken about publicly up until now.</v>

873
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:05.944
<v Speaker 2>But I think bitcoin and cryptocurrencies</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a big enough part of our society at </v>

874
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:09.364
<v Speaker 2>this point where I'm not really worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the attacks from governments on </v>

875
00:39:12.791 --> 00:39:13.624
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And initially that was my strategy from </v>

876
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:15.904
<v Speaker 2>day one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to spread bitcoin to as many </v>

877
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:20.430
<v Speaker 2>people around the world as quickly as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly could.</v>

878
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.130
<v Speaker 2>They would become too big and too wide </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread to be shut down.</v>

879
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:24.303
<v Speaker 2>So if people are using bitcoin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrencies to buy their groceries </v>

880
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:29.890
<v Speaker 2>and their diapers and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can government shut it down?</v>

881
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:30.724
<v Speaker 2>But here's an interesting way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you think we've hit that </v>

882
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 2>threshold yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're,</v>

883
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting,</v>

884
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.790
<v Speaker 2>we're getting pretty darn close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at this point,</v>

885
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:37.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

886
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:38.561
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

887
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:39.394
<v Speaker 2>a hundred something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 something governments around the </v>

888
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If one government wants to shut it down,</v>

889
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 2>that probably makes other governments </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it even more.</v>

890
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I would guess maybe there's a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at this moment.</v>

891
00:39:48.331 --> 00:39:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China has been cracking down a bit,</v>

892
00:39:49.781 --> 00:39:51.920
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would guess trump in the u.</v>

893
00:39:51.921 --> 00:39:52.754
<v Speaker 2>s government maybe like bit coin a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more now that China doesn't </v>

894
00:39:54.701 --> 00:39:55.534
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we could use a little bit of that </v>

895
00:39:58.781 --> 00:39:59.790
<v Speaker 2>leverage with China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

896
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Because how much do we owe them an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual dollar?</v>

897
00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:02.443
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can pay them back in bitcoin </v>

898
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.293
<v Speaker 2>for pennies on the dollar in the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>once the RMB goes to nothing because </v>

899
00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 2>everybody's using cryptocurrencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But another really,</v>

900
00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 2>really interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's go back in time.</v>

901
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:14.230
<v Speaker 2>And a bad guy that everybody agrees </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon,</v>

902
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:15.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adolf Hitler.</v>

903
00:40:15.131 --> 00:40:15.964
<v Speaker 2>I think pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I could do one show without a </v>

904
00:40:18.221 --> 00:40:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Hitler reference while I'm playing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe in my example here as well.</v>

905
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.953
<v Speaker 2>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you can find people out </v>

906
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:26.044
<v Speaker 2>there that don't think he was a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the vast majority of society does </v>

907
00:40:28.601 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 2>think he was a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Adolf Hitler started doing bad things</v>

908
00:40:32.651 --> 00:40:33.484
<v Speaker 2>with money stolen from people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of taxes and what did the rest of </v>

909
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:36.934
<v Speaker 2>the world do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started stealing money from other </v>

910
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:38.854
<v Speaker 2>people in the form of taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had kidnapping and slavery in the form </v>

911
00:40:41.351 --> 00:40:42.040
<v Speaker 2>of a draft.</v>

912
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:42.873
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like lots of people went </v>

913
00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:44.284
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure lots of people went in </v>

914
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:47.620
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily and we should be clear with </v>
<v Speaker 2>our language,</v>

915
00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:48.454
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The draft is the moral equivalent of </v>

916
00:40:50.141 --> 00:40:50.974
<v Speaker 2>kidnapping and slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are literally kidnapping people </v>

917
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:53.853
<v Speaker 2>and enslaving them and sending them off </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some far off land to fight against </v>

918
00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>their will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't do that,</v>

919
00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:00.170
<v Speaker 2>they go to jail and half the time when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they go off to the far off land,</v>

920
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:01.023
<v Speaker 2>they get killed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the draft is the moral equivalent of </v>

921
00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 2>kidnapping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery.</v>

922
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:04.744
<v Speaker 2>So Adolf Hitler is a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody agrees with that almost </v>

923
00:41:07.691 --> 00:41:08.524
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then the rest of the governments </v>

924
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:12.220
<v Speaker 2>around the world start going and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this crazy bad stuff.</v>

925
00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:13.054
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would happen if we had this online </v>

926
00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:15.784
<v Speaker 2>anonymous digital cash in which people </v>
<v Speaker 2>could pool their resources and set up a </v>

927
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:20.974
<v Speaker 2>betting pool and anybody that correctly </v>
<v Speaker 2>predict the right day that Adolf Hitler </v>

928
00:41:25.421 --> 00:41:28.270
<v Speaker 2>dries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can anonymously collect this,</v>

929
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars in,</v>

930
00:41:29.761 --> 00:41:30.594
<v Speaker 2>in anonymous digital cash that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>all chipped in a buck here and a buck </v>

931
00:41:33.261 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 2>there and 10 bucks a year.</v>

932
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:35.443
<v Speaker 2>I bet you could have raised a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money for someone to correctly predict </v>

933
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:42.030
<v Speaker 2>the right day that Adolf Hitler dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

934
00:41:42.031 --> 00:41:43.660
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said dystopian before.</v>

935
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going real dystopia.</v>

936
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Dystopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is this a utopia?</v>

937
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:48.554
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if people could have raised 10 </v>

938
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.593
<v Speaker 2>million bucks voluntarily for around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and Adolf Hitler can't round up </v>

939
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and send them off to the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 2>camps anymore.</v>

940
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 2>Is that a dystopia or a utopia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

941
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

942
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:01.274
<v Speaker 2>so it's a utopia in this explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a piece of me and I love all </v>

943
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:06.620
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these Topian movies,</v>

944
00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 2>which is why I can go down this road and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of different ways.</v>

945
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a piece that's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

946
00:42:10.881 --> 00:42:11.714
<v Speaker 2>you could really end up creating some </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane vigilante system where it's not </v>

947
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:17.120
<v Speaker 2>just Hitler that's going to be taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

948
00:42:17.121 --> 00:42:18.220
<v Speaker 2>but any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

949
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.590
<v Speaker 2>anybody that gets smeared by the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>

950
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:25.250
<v Speaker 2>and then this is constantly happening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that actually don't deserve it.</v>

951
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.160
<v Speaker 2>So that would be the dystopian part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in this part,</v>

952
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:33.200
<v Speaker 2>so I've been thinking about this for </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than a decade since before bitcoin.</v>

953
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

954
00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:37.131
<v Speaker 2>it's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

955
00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:37.964
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to see know Justin Bieber </v>
<v Speaker 2>or people like that we'll be having bad </v>

956
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:44.070
<v Speaker 2>things happen to happen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the net,</v>

957
00:42:44.071 --> 00:42:45.320
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look in the last century,</v>

958
00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:46.154
<v Speaker 2>governments murdered more than a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>million people around the world and </v>

959
00:42:49.971 --> 00:42:50.804
<v Speaker 2>that's all a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in effect you think it would cause </v>

960
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.880
<v Speaker 2>governments to police themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically to do good things because they</v>

961
00:42:58.881 --> 00:42:59.890
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a,</v>

962
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:02.290
<v Speaker 2>basically a ransom on them or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

963
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really the idea here.</v>

964
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 2>It it might do that or it might just </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it too dangerous for governments in</v>

965
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:09.104
<v Speaker 2>the traditional form that we have today </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they go around and boss people </v>

966
00:43:11.181 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 2>around and threatened to send them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

967
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.140
<v Speaker 2>If they don't obey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it'll make that sort of thing.</v>

968
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Not Possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a voluntary yes to.</v>

969
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I think all human interaction should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a voluntary basis.</v>

970
00:43:20.661 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 2>A starbucks asks me to buy their coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't tell me to buy their coffee.</v>

971
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:25.664
<v Speaker 2>If I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I decided I don't want to buy </v>

972
00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:29.270
<v Speaker 2>starbucks coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing bad happens to me at all,</v>

973
00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:31.670
<v Speaker 2>but if I decide I don't want to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama care,</v>

974
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.190
<v Speaker 2>if I was a US citizen living in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>

975
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I would go to jail for not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I think health insurance to obamacare</v>

976
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.040
<v Speaker 2>is a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pay for it myself.</v>

977
00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:40.874
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to be forced at the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a gun or with the threat of being </v>

978
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:45.740
<v Speaker 2>sent to jail to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to participate in that sort of thing and</v>

979
00:43:45.741 --> 00:43:46.574
<v Speaker 2>that's what governments are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The very definition of government is a </v>

980
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:49.124
<v Speaker 2>monopoly on the use of force and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing people to do things against </v>

981
00:43:52.191 --> 00:43:53.024
<v Speaker 2>their will and if you think forcing </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful people to do things against </v>

982
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:56.210
<v Speaker 2>their will is a bad thing.</v>

983
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.703
<v Speaker 2>You should be opposed to the state and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what the end effect of the </v>

984
00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.170
<v Speaker 2>invention of cryptocurrencies will be on</v>
<v Speaker 2>governments,</v>

985
00:44:03.171 --> 00:44:05.900
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure it will vastly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vastly,</v>

986
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:09.860
<v Speaker 2>vastly limit their power and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great thing for all of humankind.</v>

987
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.753
<v Speaker 2>It liberates the individual and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>speeds up the rate of economic growth </v>

988
00:44:13.191 --> 00:44:14.024
<v Speaker 2>for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe there's some scary things </v>

989
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:17.900
<v Speaker 2>that'll happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the benefits far,</v>

990
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 2>far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far outweigh the drawbacks.</v>

991
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.280
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that some people are probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching this going,</v>

992
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.111
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

993
00:44:24.111 --> 00:44:24.944
<v Speaker 2>This guy is just trying to talk a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin because he probably owns a lot </v>

994
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:29.840
<v Speaker 2>of bitcoin and he'll talk it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk it up,</v>

995
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:30.890
<v Speaker 2>talk it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it going,</v>

996
00:44:30.891 --> 00:44:31.724
<v Speaker 2>and then when he feels it's hit its peak</v>
<v Speaker 2>or when he wants to cash out cash out </v>

997
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:38.670
<v Speaker 2>and then that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is some truth.</v>

998
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.503
<v Speaker 2>I own a lot of bitcoin and bitcoin cash </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes really successful over the </v>

999
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:43.620
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All make a lot of money.</v>

1000
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I've already made a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've already donated millions to,</v>

1001
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:47.703
<v Speaker 2>to charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I donated several hundred thousand </v>

1002
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:52.830
<v Speaker 2>dollars to help Ross Ulbricht,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1003
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 2>get his appeal going and hopefully get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of prison for those that don't know,</v>

1004
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Ross Ulbricht is the person that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1005
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.173
<v Speaker 2>convicted of creating the Silk Road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the first online anonymous </v>

1006
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:04.344
<v Speaker 2>marketplace in which people could buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sell anything that sole purpose </v>

1007
00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:09.170
<v Speaker 2>wasn't to harm other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1008
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:13.680
<v Speaker 2>that guy for creating a website now has </v>
<v Speaker 2>a double life sentence,</v>

1009
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 2>plus 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't kill a single person.</v>

1010
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:17.243
<v Speaker 2>He built a website and now the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government sent them to jail for two </v>

1011
00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:20.424
<v Speaker 2>life sentences plus 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his mom would make a fantastic guest </v>

1012
00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 2>on your show in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an incredibly wonderful woman.</v>

1013
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 2>And can you imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1014
00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:29.514
<v Speaker 2>if you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine your son got sent to jail and </v>

1015
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:32.784
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna die in prison for having </v>
<v Speaker 2>built a website that allows people to </v>

1016
00:45:35.131 --> 00:45:36.930
<v Speaker 2>buy and sell things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mainly Pot,</v>

1017
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.550
<v Speaker 2>is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was going to say?</v>

1018
00:45:38.551 --> 00:45:39.384
<v Speaker 2>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mainly drugs is what people were using </v>

1019
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 2>it for and if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are drugs?</v>

1020
00:45:42.211 --> 00:45:43.044
<v Speaker 2>Drugs are things that make people feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy and there's a bunch of alcohol on </v>

1021
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:47.850
<v Speaker 2>the shelf behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that drug okay.</v>

1022
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Pots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay in California,</v>

1023
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:50.574
<v Speaker 2>but in the neighboring state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like because a bunch of people </v>

1024
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:56.700
<v Speaker 2>that you and I have never met got </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and wrote down words on a piece</v>

1025
00:45:56.701 --> 00:45:58.860
<v Speaker 2>of paper and then call those words a </v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

1026
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:00.953
<v Speaker 2>Writing down words on a piece of paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>and calling you a lot doesn't alter </v>

1027
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 2>morality either.</v>

1028
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.823
<v Speaker 2>It's perfectly moral for me to smoke pot</v>
<v Speaker 2>or drink alcohol or smoke crack or it's </v>

1029
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:10.860
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the politicians getting together and</v>

1030
00:46:10.861 --> 00:46:11.694
<v Speaker 2>writing down words on a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling it a law doesn't alter morality </v>

1031
00:46:14.581 --> 00:46:15.414
<v Speaker 2>in any way whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this poor young man is going to </v>

1032
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 2>die in prison unless he somehow gets an </v>
<v Speaker 2>appeal or it gets out,</v>

1033
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for making a website that allowed people</v>

1034
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.340
<v Speaker 2>to buy and sell these things that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>them feel happy.</v>

1035
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:27.174
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for anybody who's drank some alcohol or </v>

1036
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:31.710
<v Speaker 2>smoke some pot before they do it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes them feel happy.</v>

1037
00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.200
<v Speaker 2>It makes their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improves people's lives.</v>

1038
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:35.034
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people get out of hand and get </v>

1039
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:37.860
<v Speaker 2>addicted and do bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1040
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:39.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's life.</v>

1041
00:46:39.361 --> 00:46:40.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people die all the time.</v>

1042
00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Some people eat greasy hamburgers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get obese and die of a heart attack.</v>

1043
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:47.340
<v Speaker 2>It's their life to do it with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the politicians lives.</v>

1044
00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned a second ago that you </v>

1045
00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:54.441
<v Speaker 2>were a citizen of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually renounce your citizenship.</v>

1046
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.800
<v Speaker 2>About what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>About five years ago?</v>

1047
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand and 14.</v>
<v Speaker 2>May Fourth,</v>

1048
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>February fourth.</v>

1049
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the crowning achievements of</v>

1050
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:02.460
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had.</v>

1051
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 2>My only regret is that I didn't do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sooner.</v>

1052
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are a citizen of Japan.</v>

1053
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.451
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1054
00:47:07.451 --> 00:47:08.284
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a citizen of Japan either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually a citizen of a wonderful </v>

1055
00:47:10.111 --> 00:47:12.210
<v Speaker 2>country in the Caribbean called Saint </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kitts,</v>

1056
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 2>which is probably a country nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever heard of because there's only about</v>

1057
00:47:16.051 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 2>45,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the entire country.</v>

1058
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.570
<v Speaker 2>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1059
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:20.423
<v Speaker 2>why did I think it was Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that I've been living in Japan for </v>

1060
00:47:22.231 --> 00:47:24.310
<v Speaker 2>over a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan's my main home base.</v>

1061
00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Japan is a wonderful country.</v>

1062
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:26.423
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who hasn't visited there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were in for a real treat if you go </v>

1063
00:47:28.511 --> 00:47:29.910
<v Speaker 2>and visit Japan at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1064
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.250
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what caused this decision a couple of</v>

1065
00:47:33.251 --> 00:47:34.260
<v Speaker 2>years back and why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>St?</v>

1066
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.201
<v Speaker 2>Kit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1067
00:47:35.201 --> 00:47:38.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first got out of federal prison,</v>

1068
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.453
<v Speaker 2>I felt I had been treated incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfairly by the United States </v>

1069
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:42.484
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For people that are interested in the </v>

1070
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:44.524
<v Speaker 2>details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about it or Roger really </v>

1071
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.130
<v Speaker 2>shooting maybe real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should just hit on that.</v>

1072
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:48.964
<v Speaker 2>So why were you in prison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1073
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:50.350
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the short summaries,</v>

1074
00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:51.184
<v Speaker 2>I read all these economic books and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got really excited about the power of </v>

1075
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 2>economic freedom to make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better place.</v>

1076
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought the best way to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>more people about the wonderful benefits</v>

1077
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.324
<v Speaker 2>of economic freedom was to run for </v>
<v Speaker 2>California state assembly as a </v>

1078
00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:05.830
<v Speaker 2>libertarian candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the year 2000,</v>

1079
00:48:05.831 --> 00:48:07.630
<v Speaker 2>I ran for state assembly as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>

1080
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:08.893
<v Speaker 2>I got to have a debate against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican and Democratic candidates at </v>

1081
00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:11.854
<v Speaker 2>San Jose State University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that debate I called the ATF and </v>

1082
00:48:14.861 --> 00:48:15.694
<v Speaker 2>FBI a bunch of jackbooted thugs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderers and reference to all the </v>

1083
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.430
<v Speaker 2>children that they burned to death in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>church in Waco,</v>

1084
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Texas in I think 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was.</v>

1085
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:25.803
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe their parents were religious nuts </v>

1086
00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:28.954
<v Speaker 2>and really believed in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>magic skype people in Jesus this and </v>

1087
00:48:31.331 --> 00:48:32.164
<v Speaker 2>Jesus that</v>

1088
00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:38.290
<v Speaker 2>even if their parents were religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts burning to death,</v>

1089
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:42.220
<v Speaker 2>all the kids doesn't help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You murdered a bunch of kids.</v>

1090
00:48:42.221 --> 00:48:43.054
<v Speaker 2>So if you're somebody that goes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>burst at the bunch of kids in a church </v>

1091
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:47.320
<v Speaker 2>because their parents are religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts,</v>

1092
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.670
<v Speaker 2>you're not a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I called the ATF and FBI agents,</v>

1093
00:48:51.671 --> 00:48:52.504
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of jackbooted thugs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderers in reference to what they did </v>

1094
00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 2>in Waco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas back then.</v>

1095
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.243
<v Speaker 2>I still think there are a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>jackbooted thugs and murderers for what </v>

1096
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.820
<v Speaker 2>they did there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not just that,</v>

1097
00:49:00.821 --> 00:49:02.230
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of examples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1098
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:06.900
<v Speaker 2>it turned out there were some plain </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothed atf agents and the audience,</v>

1099
00:49:06.901 --> 00:49:11.280
<v Speaker 2>and at that point I was torn to your 21 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old somewhere in that ballpark and</v>

1100
00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I had already had some success in </v>
<v Speaker 2>business and they really didn't like the</v>

1101
00:49:15.271 --> 00:49:16.104
<v Speaker 2>things that this young man was saying as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started looking into me and </v>

1102
00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:19.651
<v Speaker 2>figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1103
00:49:19.651 --> 00:49:21.540
<v Speaker 2>how can we prosecute this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so at the time,</v>

1104
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:22.403
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling computer components on </v>

1105
00:49:23.491 --> 00:49:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Ebay and I was also selling a product </v>
<v Speaker 2>called a pest control report,</v>

1106
00:49:26.671 --> 00:49:29.370
<v Speaker 2>2000 on Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically a firecracker used by</v>

1107
00:49:29.371 --> 00:49:31.570
<v Speaker 2>farmers to scare birds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other cornfield.</v>

1108
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:34.650
<v Speaker 2>And today that sounds a bit crazy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell firecrackers on Ebay.</v>

1109
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:35.723
<v Speaker 2>This was in 1999 or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was back when he had a guns and </v>

1110
00:49:39.841 --> 00:49:41.250
<v Speaker 2>ammo section.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could buy ar,</v>

1111
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 2>fifteens and shotguns and ammunition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had a fireworks section and it,</v>

1112
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.220
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a big deal to be selling those</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things,</v>

1113
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.290
<v Speaker 2>so I was selling them on Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1114
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.510
<v Speaker 2>for those that are familiar Kybella </v>
<v Speaker 2>sporting goods catalog,</v>

1115
00:49:51.511 --> 00:49:55.020
<v Speaker 2>but they were selling the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 2>product in their catalog.</v>

1116
00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Anybody could order them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd ship them to you in the mail.</v>

1117
00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:00.120
<v Speaker 2>This was before nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't a big deal back then.</v>

1118
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.293
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wound up being the only person in the </v>

1119
00:50:02.511 --> 00:50:05.130
<v Speaker 2>entire nation to be prosecuted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling those without a permit.</v>

1120
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Even while I was in prison to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

1121
00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.720
<v Speaker 2>we're still selling the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 2>product without a permit.</v>

1122
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:10.943
<v Speaker 2>Eventually the manufacturing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other resellers were all asked to </v>

1123
00:50:12.811 --> 00:50:15.360
<v Speaker 2>stop selling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them went to prison and them had</v>

1124
00:50:15.361 --> 00:50:17.460
<v Speaker 2>to pay a fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them had any problem whatsoever.</v>

1125
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:18.563
<v Speaker 2>I was the only person in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>nation to go to prison or have any </v>

1126
00:50:20.581 --> 00:50:23.700
<v Speaker 2>problem for selling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did 10 months in federal prison,</v>

1127
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.863
<v Speaker 2>had three months of a federal probation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The day I was allowed to leave the </v>

1128
00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:28.850
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left the country,</v>

1129
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I looked into announcing my citizenship </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that time.</v>

1130
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:32.623
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately it's very expensive to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>citizenship somewhere else and it's </v>

1131
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.823
<v Speaker 2>extra difficult if you're a felon in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States to get citizenship </v>

1132
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I looked into it at the time,</v>

1133
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.820
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of work.</v>

1134
00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have as much money then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I decided to,</v>

1135
00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's good enough to just live </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of the US.</v>

1136
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Needed to pick a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't sure where to go.</v>

1137
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had had one Japanese girlfriend before</v>

1138
00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:57.920
<v Speaker 2>in the United States and it was a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1139
00:50:57.921 --> 00:50:58.754
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1140
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I figured there were more to be had in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

1141
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:01.610
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1142
00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:02.443
<v Speaker 2>if I had had a Russian girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have wound up in Russia for </v>

1143
00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Brazilian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have been Brazil.</v>

1144
00:51:05.511 --> 00:51:07.430
<v Speaker 2>It was just kind of by chance there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

1145
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but Harry m more than a decade later and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very settled in and,</v>

1146
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak fluent Japanese at this point.</v>

1147
00:51:12.441 --> 00:51:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I can give your next interview in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese if you'd like.</v>

1148
00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.193
<v Speaker 2>But why say kitts though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ultimately was saying is one of the </v>

1149
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:20.894
<v Speaker 2>few countries in the world where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get citizenship very quickly by </v>

1150
00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:24.483
<v Speaker 2>investing in real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I bought some real estate in St </v>

1151
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Kitts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visited the island in person.</v>

1152
00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I love St Kate's St Kitts is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gorgeous place,</v>

1153
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:34.430
<v Speaker 2>like the low all years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 72 degrees and the highest,</v>

1154
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:36.230
<v Speaker 2>maybe 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 degrees.</v>

1155
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Not very humid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful weather all year round.</v>

1156
00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:39.224
<v Speaker 2>So I've been spending every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter there that I think this winter </v>

1157
00:51:41.211 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 2>will be by like fourth or fifth year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1158
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:45.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm headed there after La.</v>

1159
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's a great place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1160
00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on a.</v>

1161
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.720
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking for a holiday place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to St Kitts.</v>

1162
00:51:50.721 --> 00:51:51.554
<v Speaker 2>I really recommended it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now you're on that board of tourism </v>

1163
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:54.080
<v Speaker 2>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>

1164
00:51:54.081 --> 00:51:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to come and say hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a small place in Saint Kitts.</v>

1165
00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.473
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what now I can obviously understand now </v>

1166
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:02.900
<v Speaker 2>after hearing your story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I had read about,</v>

1167
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:03.883
<v Speaker 2>obviously beforehand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand your frustrations of </v>

1168
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:06.344
<v Speaker 2>course with the government and all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things and that they singled out one </v>

1169
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:11.420
<v Speaker 2>person who all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1170
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.930
<v Speaker 2>what was it like actually that moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you would,</v>

1171
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I assume you have to sign a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>documents and what are you doing?</v>

1172
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:19.510
<v Speaker 2>You slap a guy high five at the end or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

1173
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.530
<v Speaker 2>what was that actual moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great story too.</v>

1174
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:25.040
<v Speaker 2>So I had to go to the US embassy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barbados and uh,</v>

1175
00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the name of the clerk </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1176
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:27.644
<v Speaker 2>but if he happens to see the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thank you for being such a good sport </v>

1177
00:52:29.931 --> 00:52:31.700
<v Speaker 2>and having a good sense of humor with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

1178
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:34.250
<v Speaker 2>So I went up to the and you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an interview,</v>

1179
00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:36.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to renounce your citizenship.</v>

1180
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:38.920
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that really surprised me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't know this,</v>

1181
00:52:38.921 --> 00:52:42.350
<v Speaker 2>is you're not telling them that you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop being an American.</v>

1182
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:45.530
<v Speaker 2>You're asking for their permission to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop being an American.</v>

1183
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.510
<v Speaker 2>And I asked the guy at the window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1184
00:52:47.511 --> 00:52:51.020
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen somebody be denied </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to stop being an American?</v>

1185
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:51.531
<v Speaker 2>And said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1186
00:52:51.531 --> 00:52:53.540
<v Speaker 2>it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

1187
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.403
<v Speaker 2>really was stunning to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have thought that if you don't </v>

1188
00:52:56.961 --> 00:52:59.060
<v Speaker 2>want to be an American anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be up to you.</v>

1189
00:52:59.061 --> 00:52:59.894
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our masters in Washington DC decide if </v>

1190
00:53:02.391 --> 00:53:04.490
<v Speaker 2>they're going to allow you to stop being</v>
<v Speaker 2>an American.</v>

1191
00:53:04.491 --> 00:53:05.690
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1192
00:53:05.691 --> 00:53:09.860
<v Speaker 2>this clerk at the window when I came up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I gave my bundle of paperwork,</v>

1193
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:12.590
<v Speaker 2>there was a fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fee is even higher now.</v>

1194
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:13.101
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fees,</v>

1195
00:53:13.101 --> 00:53:16.520
<v Speaker 2>2000 something dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I announced I think it was $440.</v>

1196
00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:17.691
<v Speaker 2>And he asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1197
00:53:17.691 --> 00:53:19.870
<v Speaker 2>do you want to pay with cash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit card or bitcoin?</v>

1198
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.520
<v Speaker 2>And I had the same look on my face that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just did not.</v>

1199
00:53:23.521 --> 00:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I said what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1200
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:25.973
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you know that I would be </v>

1201
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:28.460
<v Speaker 2>interested in paying in Bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1202
00:53:28.461 --> 00:53:29.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know all about you.</v>

1203
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.510
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've googled you.</v>

1204
00:53:30.511 --> 00:53:31.344
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1205
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.840
<v Speaker 2>can actually pay him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was.</v>

1206
00:53:32.841 --> 00:53:33.674
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just kidding.</v>

1207
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so basically you had to fill out,</v>

1208
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.190
<v Speaker 2>they knew you were coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1209
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:39.990
<v Speaker 2>You need an appointment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1210
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:41.820
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was just messing with you,</v>

1211
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a good sense of humor and then,</v>

1212
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:46.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have the initial,</v>

1213
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview and he,</v>

1214
00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:50.580
<v Speaker 2>ca he cautions you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1215
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he warns you.</v>

1216
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1217
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the draft is the moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of kidnapping and slavery and</v>

1218
00:53:57.941 --> 00:53:59.010
<v Speaker 2>war mass murder.</v>

1219
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I think taxation is theft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
00:54:01.081 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a voluntary,</v>

1221
00:54:02.641 --> 00:54:03.510
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in,</v>

1222
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in government.</v>

1223
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 2>And he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1224
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I have to caution you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you stopped being a US citizen,</v>

1225
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.240
<v Speaker 2>you won't be allowed to serve in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>armed forces.</v>

1226
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'm probably okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to warn you that,</v>

1227
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I've been a felon for,</v>

1228
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years now,</v>

1229
00:54:20.101 --> 00:54:22.950
<v Speaker 2>something more than 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a felon you're not even allowed to</v>

1230
00:54:22.951 --> 00:54:24.540
<v Speaker 2>vote anyhow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I philosophically,</v>

1231
00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really interested in voting at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>

1232
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.830
<v Speaker 2>And even back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't really interested in voting,</v>

1233
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.391
<v Speaker 2>but he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1234
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 2>if you renounce your US citizenship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't be allowed to vote,</v>

1235
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.770
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just throwing you all the eggs.</v>

1236
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.040
<v Speaker 2>And then another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1237
00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:38.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

1238
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 34,</v>

1239
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:43.260
<v Speaker 2>I think he said if you were announced </v>
<v Speaker 2>your US citizenship,</v>

1240
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 2>you won't be allowed to collect social </v>
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>

1241
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:46.973
<v Speaker 2>And I'm pretty sure that's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be around by the time I'm old enough to </v>

1242
00:54:49.611 --> 00:54:50.444
<v Speaker 2>retire also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was like a real breakup </v>

1243
00:54:51.631 --> 00:54:52.560
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

1244
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:53.394
<v Speaker 2>they were pulling out all the stops and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he has his script that he has to cost </v>

1245
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there might've been one more</v>

1246
00:54:57.481 --> 00:54:57.911
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all,</v>

1247
00:54:57.911 --> 00:55:00.180
<v Speaker 2>all of those were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of like,</v>

1248
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:01.530
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was I thinking?</v>

1249
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hooray,</v>

1250
00:55:02.491 --> 00:55:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to be free of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>security and all of this stuff.</v>

1251
00:55:06.841 --> 00:55:07.674
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1252
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1253
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:10.873
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a decision that people take </v>

1254
00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:13.230
<v Speaker 2>lightly either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big,</v>

1255
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.550
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big step in life.</v>

1256
00:55:14.551 --> 00:55:15.300
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1257
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.370
<v Speaker 2>they make you have a one week cooling </v>
<v Speaker 2>off period.</v>

1258
00:55:17.371 --> 00:55:18.204
<v Speaker 2>So he cautioned me of all those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I had to hang around for </v>

1259
00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:22.640
<v Speaker 2>another week on the island where I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know anybody.</v>

1260
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Then went back a week later and signed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the paperwork and this and that.</v>

1261
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:26.790
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was free.</v>

1262
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.180
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you did it.</v>

1264
00:55:30.181 --> 00:55:32.820
<v Speaker 2>So now you're a felon without US </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizenship.</v>

1265
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so every single time I come into the</v>

1266
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:38.710
<v Speaker 2>country now I get sent to the secondary </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspection and one,</v>

1267
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 2>there was another guy a because it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>

1268
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1269
00:55:41.551 --> 00:55:42.384
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a passport anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is there something on your passport </v>

1270
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.580
<v Speaker 2>get flagged in the US system as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1271
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:51.414
<v Speaker 2>watch out for this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so another interesting thing like </v>

1272
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's met me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pretty white collar kind of guy,</v>

1273
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:57.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but since my actual charges dealing </v>

1274
00:55:59.100 --> 00:55:59.933
<v Speaker 2>explosives without a license and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth pointing out that the crime isn't </v>

1275
00:56:03.121 --> 00:56:05.520
<v Speaker 2>dealing with explosives to crime is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it without the license,</v>

1276
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:06.363
<v Speaker 2>without permission slip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's automatically considered to </v>

1277
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:09.760
<v Speaker 2>be a violent felony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1278
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 2>not only am I a felon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a violent felon as well.</v>

1279
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:13.883
<v Speaker 2>And so when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a buddy that would sell </v>

1280
00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:17.840
<v Speaker 2>firecrackers out of his basement in </v>
<v Speaker 2>highschool now,</v>

1281
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:19.720
<v Speaker 2>pretty common when we were probably in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1282
00:56:19.721 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties in highschool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1283
00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:23.043
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1284
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.083
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1285
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:27.480
<v Speaker 1>I get flagged on their computer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1286
00:56:27.481 --> 00:56:28.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch out for this case.</v>

1287
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:29.403
<v Speaker 1>They the me to the secondary inspection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're real uptight about it </v>

1288
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:34.120
<v Speaker 1>and they're watching me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then other times they're like,</v>

1289
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it's sold firecrackers and Ebay.</v>

1290
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:37.324
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1291
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you're that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

1292
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.533
<v Speaker 1>But apparently they have some list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>notes about being on their computer and </v>

1293
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:45.154
<v Speaker 1>they have to read all the past notes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about me and then write new notes about </v>

1294
00:56:48.011 --> 00:56:51.430
<v Speaker 1>the time that I'm coming into the list </v>
<v Speaker 1>of notes they have to read about me gets</v>

1295
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:53.620
<v Speaker 1>longer every single time I come into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1296
00:56:53.621 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's a bit of a burden guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like an episode of Seinfeld on</v>

1297
00:56:57.671 --> 00:56:59.450
<v Speaker 1>crack or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1298
00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:00.431
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think,</v>

1299
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I think we did a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything here.</v>

1300
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.823
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do the one on one stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I know you've talked about many </v>

1301
00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:07.990
<v Speaker 1>times before and I wanted to get some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bio if you had to,</v>

1302
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:08.853
<v Speaker 1>just to wrap this whole thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to predict where this is all </v>

1303
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:12.990
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're very hopeful for all of</v>

1304
00:57:12.991 --> 00:57:13.571
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1305
00:57:13.571 --> 00:57:15.250
<v Speaker 1>there is some upside down stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1306
00:57:15.251 --> 00:57:17.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't even talk about the red.</v>

1307
00:57:17.001 --> 00:57:19.530
<v Speaker 1>It's split and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that are,</v>

1308
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:20.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got your haters and trolls and </v>

1309
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:23.230
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll deal with them.</v>

1310
00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Don't send them to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll deal with him.</v>

1311
00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:25.853
<v Speaker 1>Fear not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you had to give me like a </v>

1312
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 1>prediction of where you see all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next couple years,</v>

1313
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:32.440
<v Speaker 1>what do you think's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of hundred years ago,</v>

1314
00:57:32.441 --> 00:57:34.960
<v Speaker 1>if I told you there's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>separation of church and state,</v>

1315
00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:36.363
<v Speaker 1>you would think I'm a nutcase and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heretic and I might get burnt at the </v>

1316
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:39.820
<v Speaker 1>stake for saying such a thing.</v>

1317
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the invention of Bitcoin,</v>

1318
00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:43.504
<v Speaker 1>it would sound crazy to say that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a separation of money in </v>

1319
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:46.504
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now that doesn't sound so crazy </v>

1320
00:57:48.491 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 1>anymore and it's starting to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>right before our eyes.</v>

1321
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think within another couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

1322
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.060
<v Speaker 1>all currencies are going to be at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the control of,</v>

1323
00:57:57.061 --> 00:57:58.050
<v Speaker 1>of governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People aren't,</v>

1324
00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.190
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to be using dollars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>euros and yen.</v>

1325
00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.033
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be using bitcoin cash </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ethereum and Minero and things like </v>

1326
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:04.451
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1327
00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a wonderful,</v>

1328
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:08.320
<v Speaker 1>wonderful thing for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all of humankind.</v>

1329
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:09.154
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a separation of church and </v>

1330
00:58:10.541 --> 00:58:11.374
<v Speaker 1>state was a great thing for all of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of separation of money in state is </v>

1331
00:58:13.361 --> 00:58:14.440
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:15.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>

1333
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I thoroughly enjoy this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1334
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:18.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find I always learn a little something</v>

1335
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:19.174
<v Speaker 1>when I'm doing these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I learned a lot here and as </v>

1336
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1337
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.350
<v Speaker 1>these are ideas.</v>

1338
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:24.183
<v Speaker 1>The ideas that I try to put into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>business that I built a business here </v>

1339
00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:27.873
<v Speaker 1>are the same ideas that I try to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it on the philosophical level and </v>

1340
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:33.880
<v Speaker 1>now we've got to turn these two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>five into into something major,</v>

1341
