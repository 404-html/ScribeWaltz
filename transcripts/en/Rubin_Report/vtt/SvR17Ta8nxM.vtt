1
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.263
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are on location at the blaze studios </v>

2
00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:08.774
<v Speaker 1>here in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas and I'm sitting across from Mr </v>

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Blades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glenn Beck or I sir,</v>

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My man.</v>

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.643
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for letting us do an on </v>

6
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoot.</v>

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.433
<v Speaker 2>Not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're here for about 10 minutes </v>

8
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.314
<v Speaker 2>and then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to probably be on </v>

9
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:25.810
<v Speaker 2>the moon and then a stop at the Mars and</v>

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>you know a little bit about traveling a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

11
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.100
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in between a thousand things </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

12
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

13
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cool.</v>

14
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to spend a lot of time talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this book here,</v>

15
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>addicted to outrage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just do everything.</v>

16
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:44.810
<v Speaker 1>So right now we're about two and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks away from this big term election.</v>

17
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I suspect something completely bananas </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next two and a half weeks.</v>

18
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:51.524
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can already just see between </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the cabin are stuff that we've </v>

19
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:54.644
<v Speaker 1>been dealing with the general outrage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the things you're writing about </v>

20
00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:57.584
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said this to a group of friends </v>

21
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:00.494
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>

22
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 2>I think at this point a spaceship could </v>
<v Speaker 2>appear.</v>

23
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay and hover over New York City and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

24
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

25
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what would surprise me now</v>

26
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>will we be arguing about the gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns are the aliens?</v>

27
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

29
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.463
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely insane how everything </v>

30
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is upside down.</v>

31
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Everything is upside down.</v>

32
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think we're in a unique time?</v>

33
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Because that's one of the questions when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out there with Peterson,</v>

34
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>often people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

35
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:33.721
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.554
<v Speaker 1>everyone says we've never been more </v>
<v Speaker 1>partisan and were angrier than ever and </v>

37
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:38.364
<v Speaker 1>all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about this seem </v>

38
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>unique.</v>

39
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

40
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a glutton for history and uh,</v>

41
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have been in perilous times before.</v>

42
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we've hit the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 2>confrontations yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we are approaching it.</v>

44
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.583
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we really are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can't do because I'm actually </v>

45
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:00.404
<v Speaker 1>worried about the amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to see this on twitter all the </v>

46
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:02.661
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People saying,</v>

47
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil wars come in and you know,</v>

48
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like murmur about what would be the</v>

49
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>most horrific possible outcome of all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

50
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.703
<v Speaker 2>Or remind me to talk about the window </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think we have a window right </v>

51
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:13.704
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

52
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 2>but we have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

53
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 2>we've been worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

54
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.523
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Jefferson and Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adams Adams was called a Hermaphrodite </v>

55
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 2>by Jefferson Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson,</v>

56
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 2>his campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.983
<v Speaker 2>called him a hermaphrodite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam said back that if you elect Thomas </v>

58
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.893
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be blood in the streets and </v>

59
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:42.774
<v Speaker 2>the heads of our children and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughters will be on Pike's into every </v>

60
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've had rhetoric like this</v>

61
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.153
<v Speaker 1>for ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be thrilled to vote for either one </v>

62
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.153
<v Speaker 1>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take either I don't care heads on </v>

63
00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:57.571
<v Speaker 1>pikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be fine.</v>

64
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it all does go to in the last couple</v>

65
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>of weeks,</v>

66
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this Hillary Clinton Line on </v>

67
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 2>cnn talking to Christiane Amanpour about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we can't be civil because these,</v>

68
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning the Conservatives or Republicans</v>

69
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>are so against our values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

70
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 2>this is dangerous stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the difference,</v>

71
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.850
<v Speaker 2>we have been in these places before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we knew our founding documents,</v>

72
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 2>we knew who we served or who are God </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

73
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know who our God is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

74
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 2>is it money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it fame?</v>

75
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Is it anger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what our God is now.</v>

76
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew.</v>

77
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you wait,</v>

78
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 2>let me pause you there for a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>

79
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>when you say that about what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>founders believed,</v>

80
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 2>now they were also saying separation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>church and state the whole time.</v>

81
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:46.831
<v Speaker 2>So if you were just laying out what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>believed when you say we,</v>

82
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>who are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God was,</v>

83
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so George Washington,</v>

84
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>they did believe in the division of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Church and state.</v>

85
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Clearly I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

86
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 2>that just means if you're an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an atheist.</v>

87
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 2>We're friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're cool,</v>

88
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 2>let's get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a god person,</v>

89
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.660
<v Speaker 2>you'd do your God thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do your atheist thing,</v>

90
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.513
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we have what Adam Smith called moral </v>

91
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>sentiment in common?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

92
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Capitalism has lost the first volume of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam Smith.</v>

93
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.620
<v Speaker 2>The second volume is wealth of nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first volume is moral sentiments and</v>

94
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 2>that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

95
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:28.354
<v Speaker 2>this is an invisible hand and the market</v>
<v Speaker 2>is powerful and it will create whatever </v>

96
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be careful what you ask for.</v>

97
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you are always tempering the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral sentiment.</v>

98
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Make sure that you're a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decent,</v>

99
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 2>fair minded people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've lost that.</v>

100
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 2>We're losing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

101
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm concerned and I,</v>

102
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.313
<v Speaker 2>I talk about this a bit in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this coming for almost two </v>

103
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:00.454
<v Speaker 2>decades and I had been warning against </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and for the very first time I'm at </v>

104
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 2>the place where I'm on the air now </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

105
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.933
<v Speaker 2>this is the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the time that I said would come </v>

106
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>and now is the time for you to remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are.</v>

107
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.153
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our outrage is taking us away from </v>

108
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I've looked at this for so long,</v>

109
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have studied revolutions,</v>

110
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've studied giant movements of chaos.</v>

111
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you about,</v>

112
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

113
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

114
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the red month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

115
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.360
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

116
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.363
<v Speaker 2>I can show you what's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were three people in for </v>

117
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>people in grand movements that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten it right.</v>

118
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 2>There was Abraham Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was Martin Luther King.</v>

119
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.200
<v Speaker 2>There was Gandhi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's bond bonhoeffer.</v>

120
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you know who dietrich bonhoeffer was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

121
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Bonhoeffer last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

122
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Bon hoffer was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

123
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pastor,</v>

124
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lutheran in Germany.</v>

125
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 2>He was on the air when the fewer </v>
<v Speaker 2>declared.</v>

126
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 2>He was furious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was taken.</v>

127
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.114
<v Speaker 2>His broadcast was cutting short because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing a broadcast called the </v>

128
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 2>furor principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is wrong.</v>

129
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Don't go this way.</v>

130
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 2>He on Kristallnacht.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The very next morning he was shopping in</v>

131
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 2>those stores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Jewish stores.</v>

132
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pacifist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tried to turn the Germans back and </v>

133
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop it.</v>

134
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

135
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 2>You're going the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't do it.</v>

136
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>He eventually escaped from Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was in New York,</v>

137
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 2>not here very long because he felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty.</v>

138
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>How can I leave my country when it's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this much trouble?</v>

139
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 2>He went back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He realized there's no noise.</v>

140
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Has Stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy may be violence is the answer.</v>

141
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.830
<v Speaker 2>He was involved in one of the attempts </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill Hitler.</v>

142
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>He went to a concentration camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died.</v>

143
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 2>He was executed like five days before </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler died.</v>

144
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read his writings,</v>

145
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 2>he's gone to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's Jesus.</v>

146
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 2>He's Martin Luther King.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

147
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got it,</v>

148
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 2>and I read them and read them and read </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

149
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did he fail?</v>

150
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Silence in the face of evil is evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself not to stand is to stand.</v>

151
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 2>He's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love one another.</v>

152
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.373
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turret stopped playing the organ so you </v>

153
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:41.140
<v Speaker 2>can hear the train going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twits.</v>

154
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.073
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He failed because Germans had already </v>

155
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 2>gone over the cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had because of world war one.</v>

156
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Then the treaty of Versailles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the 19 twenties,</v>

157
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 2>they had already lost their Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian principles.</v>

158
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 2>They had lost their center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

159
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gandhi would have failed.</v>

160
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 2>People think of Gandhi is starving </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself to get the British to comply.</v>

161
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he starved himself to say to his own,</v>

162
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:13.484
<v Speaker 2>people do not rise up in anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were this close to losing and he </v>

163
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 2>knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was appealing to the sense of decency</v>

164
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:24.254
<v Speaker 2>and fairness of the British culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he knew the people because of their </v>

165
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Judeo Christian worldview would see this</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression and go,</v>

166
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we have a window and it's closing,</v>

167
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>if we give into our anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our outrage,</v>

168
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 2>and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

169
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.153
<v Speaker 2>I can't take it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will lose and that window of the </v>

170
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Judeo Christian values will close and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're done.</v>

171
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting because one of the </v>

172
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>themes that keeps coming up as I'm on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this tour is people</v>

173
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>keep asking me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much worse is it going to get before</v>

174
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of reset and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

175
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

176
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.203
<v Speaker 1>I don't want two months from now or four</v>
<v Speaker 1>years from now to look back at right </v>

177
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>before the 2018 elections and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

178
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>weren't those the good old days because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've gone on on the train to hell.</v>

179
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>So do you think there's actually no way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop it at this point?</v>

180
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

181
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I think they behind it.</v>

182
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Here's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the scenarios that I'm looking at</v>

183
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.080
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm working gaming,</v>

184
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of these.</v>

185
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I know the prediction business always </v>
<v Speaker 2>works out.</v>

186
00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:27.610
<v Speaker 2>So let's see here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

187
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.940
<v Speaker 2>So if you're wargaming yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at the next election.</v>

188
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.010
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

189
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.080
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats probably gonna win the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

190
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They win the house,</v>

191
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to at least subpoena his </v>

192
00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:40.024
<v Speaker 2>tax records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to give up tax records </v>

193
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.930
<v Speaker 2>and that will be brought to the supreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>court.</v>

194
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Remember that marker number one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

195
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.290
<v Speaker 2>day number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any place they can go on</v>

196
00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:52.120
<v Speaker 2>impeachment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to impeach him.</v>

197
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Even if they don't have anything they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>already said it.</v>

198
00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:56.650
<v Speaker 2>They have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to do it.</v>

199
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.890
<v Speaker 2>It'll be the senate that will throw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will throw it to the Senate.</v>

200
00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.360
<v Speaker 2>That's where the trial happens.</v>

201
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.030
<v Speaker 2>So impeachment just means or taking you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to court.</v>

202
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.440
<v Speaker 2>So that's day number two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Day number three,</v>

203
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump has already filed with the Supreme</v>

204
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Court saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

205
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not testifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not turning over my tax records.</v>

206
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

207
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin has already said he's already seen</v>

208
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:22.660
<v Speaker 2>that that's a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president shouldn't have to,</v>

209
00:10:22.661 --> 00:10:27.190
<v Speaker 2>so day number three when trump has </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought it to the Supreme Court,</v>

210
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.100
<v Speaker 2>then the house says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

211
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Cavanaugh's should recuse himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at a year where,</v>

212
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the three branches of government,</v>

213
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.180
<v Speaker 2>the administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

214
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.033
<v Speaker 2>plus the house and the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them will be fighting with each </v>

215
00:10:44.891 --> 00:10:47.350
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be fighting with this branch and</v>

216
00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:48.880
<v Speaker 2>there'll be fighting with the supreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>court.</v>

217
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.223
<v Speaker 2>When cavenaugh doesn't recuse himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will file articles of impeachment </v>

218
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.483
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>

219
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.943
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're leading all of these ideas </v>

220
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

221
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.880
<v Speaker 1>these ideas are trickling out or.</v>

222
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you have the press.</v>

223
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:07.210
<v Speaker 2>The fourth branch already in chaos has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has absolutely no credibility at all.</v>

224
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.580
<v Speaker 2>It's deranged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that pushes which you would call the</v>

225
00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 2>fifth branch or the first branch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people into the streets.</v>

226
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 2>How do you solve?</v>

227
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.100
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before we get to the streets,</v>

228
00:11:21.101 --> 00:11:24.910
<v Speaker 1>can I give you the one option that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think maybe saves us from all of that,</v>

229
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.680
<v Speaker 1>which is that the Republicans win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least hold in the midterms.</v>

230
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

231
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.560
<v Speaker 1>as long shot is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is finally the Democrats go,</v>

232
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to drop identity politics.</v>

233
00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:41.110
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get away from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist,</v>

234
00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrat,</v>

235
00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:43.580
<v Speaker 1>socialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I.</v>

236
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence that they would ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>look in the mirror.</v>

237
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:47.590
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've only doubled down every time.</v>

238
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I see that as the only out to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going.</v>

239
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 2>So I think if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't win the house,</v>

240
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 2>if you win the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God forbid if they went in the house and</v>

241
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 2>the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's chaos.</v>

242
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 2>But if you win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they win the house,</v>

243
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:00.724
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that scenario is going to play out in </v>

244
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:03.544
<v Speaker 2>some form or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that just gets worse and worse and </v>

245
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:06.304
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a friend of mine just </v>

246
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 2>last night about this and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

247
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 2>just exactly what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I followed it up with what you said.</v>

248
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.873
<v Speaker 2>Show me the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's no evidence I am </v>

249
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 2>spartacus is all of a sudden going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

250
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not spartacus.</v>

251
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm the carpenter from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.320
<v Speaker 2>from Nazareth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

254
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that the danger all along?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

255
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:31.800
<v Speaker 1>this is directly linked to your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

256
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I remember before the election I kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

257
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.213
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when I still considered myself </v>

258
00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:36.954
<v Speaker 1>on the left and someone that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically only voted Democrat my entire </v>

259
00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:40.854
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the one time I voted Republican </v>

260
00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:42.894
<v Speaker 1>was a Bloomberg's third term in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>City after he had flipped like 87 times </v>

261
00:12:46.771 --> 00:12:47.604
<v Speaker 1>over or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure if he was Republican </v>

262
00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:49.950
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

263
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.650
<v Speaker 1>but that I kept saying before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

264
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.860
<v Speaker 1>if you keep calling trump Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then no matter what he does,</v>

265
00:12:58.021 --> 00:12:58.854
<v Speaker 1>and no matter what reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will never be able to get yourself </v>

266
00:13:01.651 --> 00:13:03.900
<v Speaker 1>out of that little thing place you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>painted yourself.</v>

267
00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

268
00:13:05.341 --> 00:13:06.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

269
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I lived this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived this.</v>

270
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I said I'm the guy who got in so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble saying,</v>

271
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I think Barack Obama may be a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

272
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I immediately corrected it in that on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the spot and said,</v>

273
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 2>that's not quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now understand.</v>

274
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I explain it in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now understand how to express that.</v>

275
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't up on anti colonialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly wasn't up on postmodernism,</v>

276
00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm hearing all these terms that mean</v>

277
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:36.904
<v Speaker 2>nothing to me and yet they're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking groups to me and to a lot of </v>

278
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:44.460
<v Speaker 2>people in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the definition of racist.</v>

279
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't understand the difference.</v>

280
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.280
<v Speaker 2>The other part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other part at.</v>

281
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's now social justice.</v>

282
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well social justice seems wrong to me.</v>

283
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.603
<v Speaker 2>That's how I defined it then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was so divisive what I said that </v>

284
00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:05.680
<v Speaker 2>and I was really at the time struggling </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what is happening,</v>

285
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 2>how is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is this guy?</v>

286
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got more and more straightened,</v>

287
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

288
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>didn't make a lot of friends on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

289
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.163
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

290
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work.</v>

291
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 2>My base got stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bass learned things,</v>

292
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.530
<v Speaker 2>but my base also as things went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got more and more angry as did I.</v>

293
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't this working well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you cannot call people names and</v>

294
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 2>expect them to come over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>

295
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:40.894
<v Speaker 2>I just saw a new poll today that shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's eight percent of the </v>

296
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:46.300
<v Speaker 2>American public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>8,000</v>

297
00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:47.134
<v Speaker 2>people interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight percent of the American public is </v>

298
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 2>the diehard progressive radical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

299
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

300
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the never give up.</v>

301
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.233
<v Speaker 2>Conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traditional conservative is about 29 </v>

302
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:03.930
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

303
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.790
<v Speaker 2>They're both on the edges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty seven,</v>

304
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 2>29 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in that area.</v>

305
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.823
<v Speaker 2>Still on the edges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority is now being called </v>

306
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 2>the exhausted class and it's the class </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

307
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 2>And I'm in this guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be this way.</v>

308
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of this.</v>

309
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Everybody is a racist.</v>

310
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Not everybody is a homophobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the stop it.</v>

311
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.293
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cabinet Jordan Peterson got into </v>

312
00:15:34.911 --> 00:15:38.420
<v Speaker 2>trouble and I tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted back to him.</v>

313
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I think this might be the first time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree,</v>

314
00:15:41.851 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 2>but I put I think because,</v>

315
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that didn't see it,</v>

316
00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Speaker 1>basically he said that what would </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably be best.</v>

317
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:52.600
<v Speaker 1>And he did this in a tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is never the best way to do it.</v>

318
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He's already.</v>

319
00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:57.490
<v Speaker 1>He's already had his mayor Kulpa on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and released to a correct correction.</v>

320
00:15:57.491 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 1>A clarification in a blog form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

321
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.233
<v Speaker 1>but basically he said the best outcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the cabinet gets confirmed but </v>

322
00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:04.864
<v Speaker 1>then steps down and what he meant was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't saying the cabinet did do </v>

323
00:16:08.411 --> 00:16:09.244
<v Speaker 1>anything or didn't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there's any chance for a little </v>

324
00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:14.350
<v Speaker 1>bit of healing where everyone gets a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little egg on their face,</v>

325
00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:15.184
<v Speaker 1>but also it gets a little bit of dignity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to walk away with and the country </v>

326
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.710
<v Speaker 1>doesn't come apart at the seams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what he tried to do in a tweet.</v>

327
00:16:20.711 --> 00:16:24.010
<v Speaker 1>And in his blog post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's acknowledged that trying to do that</v>

328
00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:24.820
<v Speaker 1>in a tweet,</v>

329
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.490
<v Speaker 2>probably not the best name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do that in a tweet.</v>

330
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:28.763
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the people who are reading it are </v>

331
00:16:30.551 --> 00:16:33.670
<v Speaker 2>generally all about politics and tearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other apart.</v>

332
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I put,</v>

333
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I think because knowing Jordan the </v>
<v Speaker 2>little that I do,</v>

334
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a deep philosophical thinker.</v>

335
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.900
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feeling was,</v>

336
00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:49.570
<v Speaker 2>and it turns out it was right that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at that and saying,</v>

337
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

338
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.853
<v Speaker 2>in a normal world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a good world where we're all really </v>

339
00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:54.934
<v Speaker 2>trying to do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we really were all trying to do </v>

340
00:16:58.421 --> 00:16:59.710
<v Speaker 2>the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with him,</v>

341
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.420
<v Speaker 2>it would have been the best thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have Jordan say,</v>

342
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.590
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to have Kevin,</v>

343
00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you,</v>

344
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.493
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's bring the country back </v>

345
00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:10.894
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nominate somebody else and let's go </v>

346
00:17:13.061 --> 00:17:13.894
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other side would have gone </v>

347
00:17:14.891 --> 00:17:15.724
<v Speaker 2>through exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would have rewarded them in the end </v>

348
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:22.300
<v Speaker 2>because they got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're talking about the machines</v>

349
00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:26.110
<v Speaker 2>of destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So reality doesn't play a role.</v>

350
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.453
<v Speaker 2>At some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this 70 percent of America is going to </v>

351
00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:34.960
<v Speaker 2>stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut up,</v>

352
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.990
<v Speaker 2>both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you shocked</v>

353
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.430
<v Speaker 1>how many people in that 70 percent are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just afraid to do that?</v>

354
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Because when we do these meet and greets</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the peterson events,</v>

355
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the number one question I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked is what can I do?</v>

356
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid to speak and I cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

357
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.763
<v Speaker 1>from people that I'm sitting this close </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and I see this look in their eyes of </v>

359
00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 1>fear and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm that brave.</v>

360
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

361
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain it,</v>

362
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>but I don't wake up every morning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

363
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.120
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do today to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google and fight the political powers?</v>

364
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Or I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing what I think is right.</v>

365
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:11.934
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

366
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.940
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that goes to.</v>

367
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.823
<v Speaker 2>I brought my family thousand 11 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Auschwitz and I did it again because I </v>

368
00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:23.904
<v Speaker 2>see over the horizon I think and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>stood outside of the gates and we had a </v>

369
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:37.740
<v Speaker 2>prayer and then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

370
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.953
<v Speaker 2>we are here because we have to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ugliest thing man has done and we </v>

371
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:51.390
<v Speaker 2>have to decide who we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who we're going to be.</v>

372
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.793
<v Speaker 2>Because if you weren't prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean prepare for that kind </v>

373
00:18:57.031 --> 00:19:00.330
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really know who you are.</v>

374
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.730
<v Speaker 2>You will not stand when the jackbooted </v>
<v Speaker 2>thugs come down the street.</v>

375
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.120
<v Speaker 2>You have to know who you are and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe.</v>

376
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 2>So I had them read a story of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>righteous of the nation.</v>

377
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:17.100
<v Speaker 2>They could pick anyone who saved Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really try to get into their head.</v>

378
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.173
<v Speaker 2>I lined up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a just a family kind of conversation </v>

379
00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 2>with this sweet woman.</v>

380
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.780
<v Speaker 2>She just died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think last week,</v>

381
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.990
<v Speaker 2>90 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a Christian.</v>

382
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:31.350
<v Speaker 2>She was 16 years old when she saved the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first Jew.</v>

383
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Her whole family did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was remarkable.</v>

384
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

385
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 2>we talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two things I learned on that trip.</v>

386
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.390
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we were leaving,</v>

387
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

388
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.323
<v Speaker 2>I have a responsibility that's different</v>
<v Speaker 2>than most because I speak to so many </v>

389
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

390
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I believe that people have that tree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>righteousness in them.</v>

391
00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 2>I think they have that goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to do the right thing.</v>

392
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 2>How do I water it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She told me something so profound.</v>

393
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.090
<v Speaker 2>It's so game changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

394
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>she looked at me so puzzled and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

395
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.793
<v Speaker 2>you misunderstand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The righteous didn't suddenly become </v>

396
00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:18.114
<v Speaker 2>righteous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just refused to go over the cliff </v>

397
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:21.923
<v Speaker 2>with the rest of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is remember what </v>

398
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you've always believed was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just stand and just go,</v>

399
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are crazy.</v>

400
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a hero.</v>

401
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.680
<v Speaker 2>She was looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't let me film her.</v>

402
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:37.683
<v Speaker 2>She only let me take one picture of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wanted to nothing because she's </v>

403
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a hero.</v>

404
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I just remembered what was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's remarkable.</v>

405
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the default position</v>

406
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.323
<v Speaker 1>of humanity is to cower?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is that in these moments it seems </v>

407
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 1>like it's a lot easier to cower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

408
00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:57.304
<v Speaker 1>I mean even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's the thing when people say </v>

409
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 1>this to me about how do I get braver or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

410
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:06.511
<v Speaker 1>it's like we live in the freest place in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of the world and if you're,</v>

411
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're afraid now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine the second.</v>

412
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.070
<v Speaker 1>That thing gets turned a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how afraid you are going to be.</v>

413
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:12.904
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like like fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure there's a psychological </v>

414
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:16.714
<v Speaker 1>component to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fear does something in the brain </v>

415
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 1>that may be bravery or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it really is about just knowing</v>

416
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:23.840
<v Speaker 1>what you are and what do.</v>

417
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a first fear.</v>

418
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Shuts your brain down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

419
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.793
<v Speaker 2>It's shuts reason down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in fight or flight and that's a </v>

420
00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.560
<v Speaker 2>good thing because you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

421
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.281
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

422
00:21:38.281 --> 00:21:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Should I hit them a little harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>swinging,</v>

423
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:46.130
<v Speaker 2>so fear and anger really bad and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why we're addicted.</v>

424
00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will swing.</v>

425
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.500
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get shake that or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't think it's biological.</v>

426
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

427
00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:01.700
<v Speaker 2>the other person we met with in Poland </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the chief rabbi and he said,</v>

428
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 7,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were 7,000</v>

429
00:22:05.251 --> 00:22:08.640
<v Speaker 2>people that stood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

430
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

431
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.720
<v Speaker 2>have you been outwards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I have it when you go,</v>

432
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.600
<v Speaker 2>there's churches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a block away.</v>

433
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.910
<v Speaker 2>There are houses everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were old.</v>

434
00:22:17.911 --> 00:22:22.230
<v Speaker 2>They were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I left there and I was enraged.</v>

435
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.123
<v Speaker 2>I remember her crying and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and looking at the houses and screaming </v>

436
00:22:28.591 --> 00:22:31.260
<v Speaker 2>in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the hell were you?</v>

437
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Where were you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meet with him and I said,</v>

438
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.330
<v Speaker 2>how out of all the millions of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

439
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.620
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking that's a small number.</v>

440
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.340
<v Speaker 2>You said that's an incredible number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

441
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:50.953
<v Speaker 2>People you're in a scary movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look away when something like this </v>

442
00:22:56.661 --> 00:22:57.494
<v Speaker 2>is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is human nature to look away or to </v>

443
00:23:01.701 --> 00:23:04.080
<v Speaker 2>dismiss and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

444
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:04.923
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

445
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.773
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

446
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.780
<v Speaker 2>we have this gift of fear that warns us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we use logic and sometimes we use it</v>

447
00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:14.204
<v Speaker 2>just to protect ourselves because Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people are afraid of </v>

448
00:23:18.531 --> 00:23:19.364
<v Speaker 2>standing.</v>

449
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I think they're afraid of knowing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

450
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.323
<v Speaker 2>You look at the people who stand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who stand are the ones who </v>

451
00:23:30.441 --> 00:23:31.580
<v Speaker 2>are going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:23:31.581 --> 00:23:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I learned something new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned something.</v>

453
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.220
<v Speaker 2>It's changed me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not standing.</v>

454
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.710
<v Speaker 2>You're not standing because you're brave</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to take a stand.</v>

455
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.300
<v Speaker 2>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

456
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I just scales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fell off my eyes.</v>

457
00:23:43.161 --> 00:23:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I just learned something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you are inquisitive,</v>

458
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 2>when you are based in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

459
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

460
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I really want to know you have already </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared to hear,</v>

461
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 2>but do you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I,</v>

462
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I know you know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've talked about it.</v>

463
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I went through it and you went through </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

464
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.510
<v Speaker 2>You do come to a point to where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

465
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.310
<v Speaker 2>if I take another step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in my life could change,</v>

466
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.203
<v Speaker 2>my friends might change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might look at me differently and </v>

467
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:19.210
<v Speaker 2>you take that step and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

468
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I want to know the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where people fail.</v>

469
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.070
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>

470
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.903
<v Speaker 2>If you can't take that leap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I really think you're </v>

471
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:31.754
<v Speaker 2>seeing people like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing the inquisitive because </v>

472
00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 2>that's in their nature to question </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

473
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.200
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense.</v>

474
00:24:39.201 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're like that,</v>

475
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.493
<v Speaker 2>you most likely have already passed that</v>
<v Speaker 2>line of uncomfortability because you've </v>

476
00:24:46.341 --> 00:24:49.100
<v Speaker 2>had things that you realized you went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh crap.</v>

477
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.293
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I guess I don't believe that </v>

478
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:52.510
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

479
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just don't know how I could wake </v>

480
00:24:54.971 --> 00:24:57.970
<v Speaker 1>up and put stuff in my hair and look in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mirror and go,</v>

481
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.190
<v Speaker 1>that's why I just don't know how I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

482
00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 1>but I know some people do it and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

483
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:02.643
<v Speaker 1>I think this is what Jordan would </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe as sort of the slow road to </v>

484
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:05.074
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will just diminish yourself and </v>

485
00:25:06.221 --> 00:25:09.430
<v Speaker 1>diminish yourself every everyday of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life until the end.</v>

486
00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:10.743
<v Speaker 2>You have to stop looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to turn around because it will </v>

487
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.220
<v Speaker 2>always present you with the option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

488
00:25:18.221 --> 00:25:19.054
<v Speaker 2>you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You looked out and you saw them just </v>

489
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.350
<v Speaker 2>lining up a family of Jews shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

490
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what do you do once you see it?</v>

491
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.480
<v Speaker 2>It presents you with a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I go back to sleep or do I stand so</v>

492
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.861
<v Speaker 1>I know every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

493
00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:37.690
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to always be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

494
00:25:37.691 --> 00:25:38.524
<v Speaker 1>both sides are going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're equally horrible and all of </v>

495
00:25:40.871 --> 00:25:43.090
<v Speaker 1>those things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like the easy,</v>

496
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.073
<v Speaker 1>the easy way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that that's what you're </v>

497
00:25:45.221 --> 00:25:46.630
<v Speaker 1>doing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's sort of the easy way to do it</v>

498
00:25:46.631 --> 00:25:48.460
<v Speaker 1>and we all fall in that trap sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

499
00:25:48.461 --> 00:25:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Because just for brevity sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's easier to say that,</v>

500
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.043
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that for all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that that absolutely despise </v>

501
00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:57.520
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

502
00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.443
<v Speaker 1>that hate everything about the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right basically has been in power </v>

503
00:26:00.821 --> 00:26:01.654
<v Speaker 1>for last two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of good things happening </v>

504
00:26:03.491 --> 00:26:07.600
<v Speaker 1>in the country related to economics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we're not entering foreign</v>

505
00:26:07.601 --> 00:26:08.434
<v Speaker 1>wars and there's some interesting things</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening with North Korea in a series </v>

506
00:26:11.081 --> 00:26:16.000
<v Speaker 1>of other things and the state has not </v>
<v Speaker 1>used its power to silence anyone.</v>

507
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.163
<v Speaker 1>What I fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I don't think it's an </v>

508
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:19.811
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

509
00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:20.644
<v Speaker 1>both sides are crazy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the left is about state power </v>

510
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.060
<v Speaker 1>and what I fear is they've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

511
00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:28.894
<v Speaker 1>half of the country's Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot be civil with them because </v>

512
00:26:30.971 --> 00:26:33.730
<v Speaker 1>they're coming to get us and if these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people took power,</v>

513
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.103
<v Speaker 1>well now we have everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just laid out because they don't mind </v>

514
00:26:37.541 --> 00:26:40.420
<v Speaker 1>using the apparatus of the state to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish their goals,</v>

515
00:26:40.421 --> 00:26:42.970
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying Republicans are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always write about this stuff and they.</v>

516
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 1>They screw up all</v>

517
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 2>the little government things that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should care about and all of that.</v>

518
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.323
<v Speaker 2>The left has become everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said the tea party was that we </v>

519
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:53.580
<v Speaker 2>weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't.</v>

520
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 2>They have become violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have become unreasonable.</v>

521
00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 2>They want to silence people and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>will silence people.</v>

522
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.500
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're seeing people's start </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin to stand up and say,</v>

523
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.930
<v Speaker 2>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

524
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.990
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of my fears with Donald Trump.</v>

525
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 2>And the great thing is he says a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of it never happens.</v>

526
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fear is,</v>

527
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has said,</v>

528
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:21.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should look into the license of</v>

529
00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 2>these companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

530
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.143
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he means it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you signal that to people on the </v>

531
00:27:28.261 --> 00:27:31.470
<v Speaker 2>right or the left your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically saying,</v>

532
00:27:31.471 --> 00:27:32.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on the,</v>

533
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.910
<v Speaker 2>that's on the field of play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not on the field of play.</v>

534
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.273
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there's an interesting </v>

535
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.860
<v Speaker 2>libertarian argument whether the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government should be giving licensing.</v>

536
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.151
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

537
00:27:41.151 --> 00:27:41.984
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they should have license </v>

538
00:27:42.511 --> 00:27:43.101
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

539
00:27:43.101 --> 00:27:43.471
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

540
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't want the government to</v>

541
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:46.680
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

542
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.260
<v Speaker 2>you've been a little harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to look into your life.</v>

543
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

544
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get them out of that.</v>

545
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.793
<v Speaker 2>Here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing that people aren't </v>

546
00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 2>thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Government is about to become,</v>

547
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.813
<v Speaker 2>unless it marries into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty inconsequential because it will </v>

548
00:28:04.841 --> 00:28:07.930
<v Speaker 2>never be able to keep up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

549
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.180
<v Speaker 2>So it was that the saving grace here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

550
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.163
<v Speaker 2>not that I was going to give Google a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the left is concentrating their </v>

551
00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:20.281
<v Speaker 2>power in silicon valley and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really silence people.</v>

552
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.810
<v Speaker 2>The guy who wrote IBM and the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

553
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.090
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name.</v>

554
00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Really Brilliant Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well thought out.</v>

555
00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:33.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking and I'm talking about </v>

556
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:43.080
<v Speaker 2>how the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they silence people and how they,</v>

557
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.973
<v Speaker 2>they coordinate people off and then just</v>
<v Speaker 2>get smaller and smaller groups and then </v>

558
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:50.700
<v Speaker 2>they eventually put you behind a wall in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ghetto.</v>

559
00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:52.683
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

560
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:57.340
<v Speaker 2>they would build the wall higher and </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher so people couldn't hear or see.</v>

561
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what Google and facebook are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing?</v>

562
00:29:02.031 --> 00:29:06.620
<v Speaker 2>We're building digital ghettos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the ability now.</v>

563
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.783
<v Speaker 2>You can speak all you want Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm changing the algorithm and </v>

564
00:29:12.291 --> 00:29:14.480
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

565
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you look at what the deal with facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

566
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.813
<v Speaker 2>I promote them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give them my 10 million listeners and </v>

567
00:29:24.771 --> 00:29:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

568
00:29:25.791 --> 00:29:29.600
<v Speaker 2>you can find me at facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's communicate.</v>

569
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Then they take those listeners that </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

570
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.160
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

571
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:40.220
<v Speaker 2>and then they changed the algorithm and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't communicate to my own people.</v>

572
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and know this is happening across</v>

573
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.903
<v Speaker 1>the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably saw my insane tweet thread </v>

574
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:45.574
<v Speaker 1>about all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started tweeting all of these </v>

575
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real people,</v>

576
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 1>not Russian bots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian avatars.</v>

577
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I was taking purposely real people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>real names and real pictures and they're</v>

578
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 1>all saying they're unsubscribed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were people who pay.</v>

579
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.740
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just the free people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the people who pay for Youtube,</v>

580
00:29:58.741 --> 00:30:01.810
<v Speaker 1>red or youtube TV still getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsubscribed and it's like,</v>

581
00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:05.280
<v Speaker 1>what did we all sign up for here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there I do.</v>

582
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 1>You like the biblical analogies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do one here.</v>

583
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.190
<v Speaker 1>There was David versus Goliath and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think dave can take down Google</v>

584
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:14.543
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave.</v>

585
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

586
00:30:15.841 --> 00:30:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being slightly hyperbolic obviously,</v>

587
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.810
<v Speaker 1>but I think that these things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>become so big.</v>

588
00:30:21.811 --> 00:30:22.644
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this I guess is what the essence of the </v>

589
00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:24.114
<v Speaker 1>story was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

590
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.223
<v Speaker 1>That this Goliath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Google has become so big that it </v>

591
00:30:27.481 --> 00:30:30.780
<v Speaker 1>will crumble under its own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the weight of its own crap,</v>

592
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.913
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there will be enough people inside </v>

593
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.600
<v Speaker 1>the broken machine that will wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hope that individuals basically,</v>

594
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I hope all you got is hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

595
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your,</v>

596
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.960
<v Speaker 2>your three to five years away from it </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a cage,</v>

597
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their behavior with China,</v>

598
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.200
<v Speaker 2>which I outline in the book is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific.</v>

599
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what China,</v>

600
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.573
<v Speaker 2>what the road China is going down is </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying and Google is right there </v>

601
00:30:58.951 --> 00:31:00.320
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

602
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.910
<v Speaker 2>and that is evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is evil.</v>

603
00:31:02.911 --> 00:31:03.744
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be evil.</v>

604
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.470
<v Speaker 2>That is the definition of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

605
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 2>and if they just slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.723
<v Speaker 2>the guy who closes the door on the gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>chamber was most likely a guy that was </v>

607
00:31:16.651 --> 00:31:19.890
<v Speaker 2>fixing trucks before the war and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal guy.</v>

608
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't suddenly become evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You slowly move into it.</v>

609
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.283
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're surrounded by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of people that are all absolutely </v>

610
00:31:30.151 --> 00:31:30.984
<v Speaker 2>convinced that they are right and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other voice is wrong and therefore we </v>

611
00:31:35.251 --> 00:31:40.251
<v Speaker 2>just have to filter them out with ai and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they are gobbling,</v>

612
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.253
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really disturbing and the problem </v>

613
00:31:46.711 --> 00:31:47.790
<v Speaker 2>is going to happen.</v>

614
00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to start hitting massive job</v>

615
00:31:51.871 --> 00:31:53.280
<v Speaker 2>loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 20,</v>

616
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:54.001
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

617
00:31:54.001 --> 00:31:55.290
<v Speaker 2>21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22.</v>

618
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.350
<v Speaker 2>That's when you're going to really start</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel the effects of,</v>

619
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.170
<v Speaker 2>of Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

620
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.950
<v Speaker 2>when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at history and we know it,</v>

621
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.053
<v Speaker 2>all the politicians now are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get those jobs back from </v>

622
00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:08.634
<v Speaker 2>China because they're leaving China </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they get into expensive in </v>

623
00:32:10.741 --> 00:32:13.200
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not getting those jobs back.</v>

624
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And especially because a ai and robotics</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

625
00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.733
<v Speaker 2>are growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have 30 percent unemployment by </v>

626
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.953
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

627
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.640
<v Speaker 2>30 percent permanent unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look at this,</v>

628
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.940
<v Speaker 2>what do politicians always do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got to find a bad guy.</v>

629
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now it's China,</v>

630
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.130
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as people realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

631
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.920
<v Speaker 2>it's silicon valley that's taking my </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

632
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.323
<v Speaker 2>The then says it's those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people that are building the </v>

633
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:45.194
<v Speaker 2>robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless those people also see over the </v>

634
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:51.014
<v Speaker 2>horizon and become buddy buddy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their friends in Washington and they </v>

635
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:56.954
<v Speaker 2>work together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have a surveillance state that </v>

636
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we ever get out of.</v>

637
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

638
00:33:08.141 --> 00:33:10.960
<v Speaker 1>So I think the first time we sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I asked you this,</v>

639
00:33:10.961 --> 00:33:12.310
<v Speaker 1>so this seems like the right segue for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

640
00:33:12.311 --> 00:33:13.144
<v Speaker 1>So for everything that we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about here and the addiction to our age </v>

641
00:33:15.431 --> 00:33:16.264
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a certain amount of </v>

642
00:33:17.081 --> 00:33:18.790
<v Speaker 1>people that are watching this and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

643
00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Glenn Beck was one of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was peddling this stuff.</v>

644
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:22.523
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

645
00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I know you pretty well right now</v>

646
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.460
<v Speaker 1>and I feel like you are honest in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and you've.</v>

647
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.430
<v Speaker 1>You've had some mayor Kulpa is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things you've said.</v>

648
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.533
<v Speaker 1>Even just a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got into something on twitter with </v>

649
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:39.810
<v Speaker 1>my friend in new eyes and you fully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sent you a clip of something that you</v>

650
00:33:39.811 --> 00:33:42.630
<v Speaker 1>did about him a couple of years back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fully,</v>

651
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.640
<v Speaker 1>you apologized immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

652
00:33:44.641 --> 00:33:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to talk to you and learn more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of those things.</v>

653
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Just about him today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's coming in.</v>

654
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:50.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know and I loop you guys in an </v>

655

656
00:33:51.781 --> 00:33:52.614
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

657
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.873
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

658
00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:57.070
<v Speaker 1>is there anything you can add to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>about just sort of how you've changed?</v>

659
00:33:57.071 --> 00:33:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember a moment,</v>

660
00:33:58.421 --> 00:33:59.254
<v Speaker 1>was there something about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe there are people that are </v>

661
00:34:00.791 --> 00:34:01.624
<v Speaker 1>going down that road right now that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still want more of the outrage and </v>

662
00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:05.440
<v Speaker 1>stiller is still are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

663
00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:06.483
<v Speaker 1>as they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit posting on twitter and the rest of </v>

664
00:34:08.621 --> 00:34:09.490
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

665
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.740
<v Speaker 1>if you were trying to get somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn back.</v>

666
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.863
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were really personal </v>

667
00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:18.160
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went from the,</v>

668
00:34:18.161 --> 00:34:18.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

669
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.610
<v Speaker 2>that global poll that comes out around </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas time,</v>

670
00:34:21.611 --> 00:34:22.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

671
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.970
<v Speaker 2>most admired man of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

672
00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I was tied with the pope just behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nelson Mandela.</v>

673
00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

674
00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.730
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twelve months later,</v>

675
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm no longer on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hated.</v>

676
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I was saying the same things on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was saying on Fox.</v>

677
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was confusing.</v>

678
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

679
00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:51.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be hated by half of the </v>

680
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:55.670
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

681
00:34:55.671 --> 00:34:59.620
<v Speaker 2>unless you're just a maniacal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 2>ego maniac that is just beyond any kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of redemption.</v>

683
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.460
<v Speaker 2>You cannot be hated by half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

684
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

685
00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 2>a false hero for the other half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and not go,</v>

686
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that.</v>

687
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

688
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:24.570
<v Speaker 2>So who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What part of it most people will go,</v>

689
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:25.763
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spent millions of dollars to </v>

690
00:35:27.151 --> 00:35:29.850
<v Speaker 2>destroy my reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take things out of context.</v>

691
00:35:29.851 --> 00:35:30.684
<v Speaker 2>And they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also did things because my </v>

692
00:35:34.931 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 2>philosophy at the time was if I can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough eyeballs,</v>

693
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.500
<v Speaker 2>if I can get people to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which puts me in leader Hosan,</v>

694
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>singing Edelweiss,</v>

695
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.843
<v Speaker 2>I can get people to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I present them with facts and my </v>

696
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:56.790
<v Speaker 2>opinion of where it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It forget about everything else.</v>

697
00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 2>They'll hang onto the facts and someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the press will go,</v>

698
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to prove him wrong.</v>

699
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 1>They never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never would look at the facts.</v>

700
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.053
<v Speaker 1>So this is always where they just want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to belittle you and changes to silence </v>

701
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.650
<v Speaker 1>us</v>

702
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.110
<v Speaker 2>and I and I helped them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

703
00:36:15.111 --> 00:36:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I added to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying it's somebody else.</v>

704
00:36:18.201 --> 00:36:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I am taking my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my responsibility.</v>

705
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.720
<v Speaker 2>But the biggest thing is now on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side,</v>

706
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.350
<v Speaker 2>I can look and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

707
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 2>all of you in the press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said I was the worst.</v>

708
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Let let me go get the transcripts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what I just said.</v>

709
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:43.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what you said to the 10th power </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>

710
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't work.</v>

711
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:50.070
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong and it won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody wants to do that.</v>

712
00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

713
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to point to the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

714
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's willing to go to me.</v>

715
00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.530
<v Speaker 1>But you think that 70 percent that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned before,</v>

716
00:37:00.531 --> 00:37:02.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're starting to do that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

717
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

718
00:37:03.201 --> 00:37:04.034
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find how to get out of </v>

719
00:37:05.811 --> 00:37:06.644
<v Speaker 1>this and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that 70 percent where I'm </v>

720
00:37:08.421 --> 00:37:09.254
<v Speaker 1>meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a select group because </v>

721
00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:11.114
<v Speaker 1>they're coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming to see me and Jordan and </v>

722
00:37:12.261 --> 00:37:13.330
<v Speaker 1>take 70 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

723
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.300
<v Speaker 2>take 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 committed,</v>

724
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:21.070
<v Speaker 2>10 percent committed changes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventeen is your tipping point,</v>

725
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.233
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't take all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Revolution was fought by about 20 </v>

726
00:37:25.541 --> 00:37:27.380
<v Speaker 2>percent of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

727
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Those were the ones who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in this.</v>

728
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.740
<v Speaker 2>We have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to understand it.</v>

729
00:37:35.741 --> 00:37:36.574
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the book is about postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how that works and what its goals </v>

730
00:37:41.051 --> 00:37:44.560
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does postmodern even mean?</v>

731
00:37:44.561 --> 00:37:46.660
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the modern world?</v>

732
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:51.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not about a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the scientific process.</v>

733
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:56.490
<v Speaker 2>It's about exploration and empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>data and testing a and B and living with</v>

734
00:37:58.661 --> 00:38:01.240
<v Speaker 2>the results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the modern world is.</v>

735
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.200
<v Speaker 2>So when you realize,</v>

736
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.063
<v Speaker 1>so you would say postmodern really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti modern in essence it because it's </v>

737
00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:11.030
<v Speaker 1>going against the ways that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to measure anything.</v>

738
00:38:11.031 --> 00:38:13.030
<v Speaker 1>The way we've been able to look at it.</v>

739
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.143
<v Speaker 2>Only you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you don't understand postmodernism </v>

740
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.450
<v Speaker 2>and you read the headline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I did,</v>

741
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:25.810
<v Speaker 2>math is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You either go,</v>

742
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.920
<v Speaker 2>these people are out of their minds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't take it anymore,</v>

743
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.010
<v Speaker 2>or you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how?</v>

744
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 2>How did they get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you asked that question,</v>

745
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:44.460
<v Speaker 2>you start to go and peel the layers down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see the core of this idea,</v>

746
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.473
<v Speaker 2>good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what came out of the modern era of </v>

747
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.800
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they say,</v>

748
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:56.750
<v Speaker 1>this is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bad.</v>

749
00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:58.040
<v Speaker 1>That that really is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

750
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 2>and anything that holds this up must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>

751
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 2>If that's math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's you,</v>

752
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you understand that.</v>

753
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 2>It's all about deconstruction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>deconstruction is all about chaos.</v>

754
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:18.040
<v Speaker 2>You must not do anything to hasten the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos it.</v>

755
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:19.223
<v Speaker 2>You have to restrain yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best way to fight this isn't about </v>

756
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Gandhi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

757
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I want to be just like Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

758
00:39:24.341 --> 00:39:25.174
<v Speaker 2>I want to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the best way to win is to restrain </v>

759
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 2>yourself from adding any of the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Clear,</v>

760
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 2>be stuffed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoken.</v>

761
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Be the person that everybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

762
00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:36.664
<v Speaker 2>When everybody is arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of look around the room and </v>

763
00:39:38.471 --> 00:39:39.304
<v Speaker 2>there's maybe three people over there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just laughing and having fun </v>

764
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 2>and just because you will be the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will control the room.</v>

765
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:47.620
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else will kill themselves,</v>

766
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.910
<v Speaker 2>but the the majority of people will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

767
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I hate this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll make their way over to you.</v>

768
00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.613
<v Speaker 2>That's what we have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to stop fighting on the stupid </v>

769
00:40:01.301 --> 00:40:03.460
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stupid stuff.</v>

770
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Gay wedding cakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good God,</v>

771
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.104
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feeling homosexuals right now today in </v>

772
00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:13.300
<v Speaker 2>parts of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you say?</v>

773
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 2>We start there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you say?</v>

774
00:40:14.591 --> 00:40:18.970
<v Speaker 2>We talk about something that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a difference,</v>

775
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.660
<v Speaker 2>really makes a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get to the gay wedding cakes.</v>

776
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just let's be good people first.</v>

777
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:27.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting how people just </v>

778
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:32.950
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do the intellectual work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's like we have these,</v>

779
00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.830
<v Speaker 1>we have these phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have endless distractions.</v>

780
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.023
<v Speaker 1>To the point that perhaps 20 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have a moment standing on a </v>

781
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:43.870
<v Speaker 1>corner waiting for a friend to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner where you'd have to think,</v>

782
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.033
<v Speaker 1>but we can distract ourselves to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where we actually never have to </v>

783
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:48.724
<v Speaker 1>think anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time you just stood </v>

784
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:51.551
<v Speaker 1>somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

785
00:40:51.551 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I know you're aware of all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

786
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:54.280
<v Speaker 1>but where it was say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you,</v>

787
00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Glenn back just stood somewhere on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner waiting for your wife to meet you</v>

788
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>and you weren't looking at your phone or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't.</v>

789
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do what you did,</v>

790
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 1>but I can't do it for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

791
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.090
<v Speaker 1>many employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

792
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I only have like five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

793
00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:10.820
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

794
00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.920
<v Speaker 2>I try to do it once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't make it every time,</v>

795
00:41:15.921 --> 00:41:20.780
<v Speaker 2>but just not going to be online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not pick up your device,</v>

796
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.160
<v Speaker 2>go out on a date with your wife and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>not carry a device.</v>

797
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

798
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 2>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's important,</v>

799
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I learned something.</v>

800
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.153
<v Speaker 2>My alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was struggling with so many things </v>

801
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.270
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

802
00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.290
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't want to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to think about,</v>

803
00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to think about the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had done in my life.</v>

804
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:51.890
<v Speaker 2>The things that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

805
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:55.520
<v Speaker 2>poor me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just didn't want to think about it and I</v>

806
00:41:55.521 --> 00:41:56.354
<v Speaker 2>would turn on the radio and I'd turn it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up loud and I'd be driving my car and I </v>

807
00:42:01.071 --> 00:42:03.650
<v Speaker 2>never really consciously connected the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

808
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.463
<v Speaker 2>It got to the point where it was so bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if I didn't have something to </v>

809
00:42:08.381 --> 00:42:09.214
<v Speaker 2>distract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would literally be by myself and I go </v>

810
00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>

811
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.910
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la.</v>

812
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Just to block out my thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

813
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:17.223
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized when I was finally no </v>

814
00:42:22.571 --> 00:42:25.980
<v Speaker 2>longer I was sober and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

815
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not just not drinking,</v>

816
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:30.703
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the time that I was driving </v>

817
00:42:33.461 --> 00:42:34.294
<v Speaker 2>someplace and I must have been driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>for about an hour and I hadn't turned </v>

818
00:42:36.701 --> 00:42:37.534
<v Speaker 2>anything on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized at one point I'm just </v>

819
00:42:39.581 --> 00:42:41.240
<v Speaker 2>driving and I kind of come to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:42:41.241 --> 00:42:42.720
<v Speaker 2>kind of come to thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

821
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.890
<v Speaker 2>about what's in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening.</v>

822
00:42:44.891 --> 00:42:45.431
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

823
00:42:45.431 --> 00:42:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what's in the rate.</v>

824
00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:47.903
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been alone with myself and my </v>

825
00:42:51.521 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 2>thoughts for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sign of mental health.</v>

826
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:58.103
<v Speaker 2>We're sick,</v>

827
00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.390
<v Speaker 1>we're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the,</v>

828
00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:02.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the book,</v>

829
00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:07.030
<v Speaker 1>in the forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a very graciously,</v>

830
00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:07.864
<v Speaker 1>and I'm humbled that you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you included me in a list of names of </v>

831
00:43:10.211 --> 00:43:11.800
<v Speaker 1>people that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

832
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that you put in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

833
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

834
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 2>ben had this and I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even wrote to,</v>

835
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:23.570
<v Speaker 2>to Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an inscription on this page like</v>

836
00:43:23.571 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 2>two days later he calls me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

837
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.510
<v Speaker 2>we were with each other for two days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

838
00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks very much.</v>

839
00:43:30.411 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 2>And then like at midnight one night I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get this text,</v>

840
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.183
<v Speaker 2>he's a busy guy and I know to those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to step out in front of the </v>

841
00:43:36.471 --> 00:43:40.370
<v Speaker 2>crowd to question reason and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous conversations,</v>

842
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.460
<v Speaker 2>men with whom I may strongly disagree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with at times.</v>

843
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:44.294
<v Speaker 2>But we'll all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will always consider real founders of </v>

844
00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:50.270
<v Speaker 2>reason and contemporary heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro,</v>

845
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson,</v>

846
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Bret Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris,</v>

847
00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Sacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pendulum let</v>

848
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.043
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I don't want to make this </v>

849
00:43:57.431 --> 00:43:58.264
<v Speaker 1>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the one that I thought was most </v>

850
00:43:59.231 --> 00:44:01.720
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually with Sam Harris because</v>

851
00:44:01.721 --> 00:44:02.554
<v Speaker 1>I suspect you guys probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he disagrees with Jordan Peterson on </v>

852
00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:08.920
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everything,</v>

853
00:44:08.921 --> 00:44:10.810
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialism,</v>

854
00:44:10.811 --> 00:44:12.760
<v Speaker 1>meaning of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole damn thing.</v>

855
00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:16.000
<v Speaker 1>You guys probably disagree on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

856
00:44:16.001 --> 00:44:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Plus one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we went through,</v>

857
00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:20.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought well this is what it's all</v>

858
00:44:20.051 --> 00:44:21.940
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it's all about.</v>

859
00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.350
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But would you have ever.</v>

860
00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were writing a book,</v>

861
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:26.343
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still would have done that when I've </v>

862
00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 1>often joked that my library is a library</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a serial killer because</v>

863
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I was too broke to actually go get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>formal education,</v>

864
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 2>so I would go to barnes and noble or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>library and I'd go,</v>

865
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:44.010
<v Speaker 2>who hates each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this opinion,</v>

866
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.450
<v Speaker 2>who hates this opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person,</v>

867
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 2>and I would read them both and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at them and say,</v>

868
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.100
<v Speaker 2>is there enter anything where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>intersect?</v>

869
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.233
<v Speaker 2>Because that I know is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If both these people are from opposite </v>

870
00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:05.130
<v Speaker 2>ends of the spectrum and they both say </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>

871
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I know that one line in both books is </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

872
00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.123
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so start small and build the basis of </v>

873
00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:12.564
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what motivated me was aligned from </v>

874
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Jefferson that he wrote to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>nephew Peter car.</v>

875
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Peter's parents had both died when his </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad was ill.</v>

876
00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:25.194
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you please educate my son when he </v>

877
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:28.014
<v Speaker 2>comes of age?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Thomas writes this unbelievable </v>

878
00:45:31.111 --> 00:45:31.800
<v Speaker 2>letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

879
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.510
<v Speaker 2>in mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do this in literature.</v>

880
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:36.420
<v Speaker 2>You have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last thing is religion.</v>

881
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's changed my life.</v>

882
00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to religion,</v>

883
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.033
<v Speaker 2>above all things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix reason firmly in her seat and </v>

884
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:49.494
<v Speaker 2>question with boldness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the very existence of God for if </v>

885
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:56.400
<v Speaker 2>there be a god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must surely rather honest questioning</v>

886
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.630
<v Speaker 2>over blindfolded fear.</v>

887
00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 2>We break down on the word honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honest questioning.</v>

888
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.573
<v Speaker 2>You and I like each other and get along </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you haven't asked me a setup </v>

889
00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.420
<v Speaker 2>question and I've never asked you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>setup question.</v>

890
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.390
<v Speaker 2>It's an honest question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang on just a second.</v>

891
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.060
<v Speaker 2>But that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

892
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:20.490
<v Speaker 2>that is in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

893
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That keeps you young.</v>

894
00:46:22.271 --> 00:46:25.150
<v Speaker 2>That keeps you alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minute you start.</v>

895
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.920
<v Speaker 2>I knew my father was going to die.</v>

896
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.410
<v Speaker 2>My father was the kind of guy who always</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a book in this packet pocket.</v>

897
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Self educated man and a,</v>

898
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:43.310
<v Speaker 2>there's always exploring and questioning</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was so granola,</v>

899
00:46:43.761 --> 00:46:46.610
<v Speaker 2>fruit loop being one with the universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of guy.</v>

900
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.850
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call them up.</v>

901
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:53.750
<v Speaker 2>We were best friends for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

902
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd call them sometimes two,</v>

903
00:46:56.621 --> 00:46:59.080
<v Speaker 2>three times a day and we'd just talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about books,</v>

904
00:46:59.081 --> 00:47:01.330
<v Speaker 2>we're reading and things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did you hear this opinion?</v>

905
00:47:01.331 --> 00:47:03.820
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about the future of the past,</v>

906
00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

907
00:47:06.061 --> 00:47:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read this fantastic book.</v>

908
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to read this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to send it to you.</v>

909
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:15.570
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

910
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:18.890
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

911
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.070
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired.</v>

912
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've learned enough.</v>

913
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three years later he was,</v>

914
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.370
<v Speaker 2>he was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

915
00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:36.750
<v Speaker 2>when you are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're built to explore.</v>

916
00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:38.730
<v Speaker 2>And when you're not exploring</v>

917
00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.573
<v Speaker 4>what's left,</v>

918
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.433
<v Speaker 1>w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you be doing if you weren't </v>

919
00:47:42.871 --> 00:47:43.704
<v Speaker 1>doing this?</v>

920
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I told my wife when she married me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one reason I've lucked out so much.</v>

921
00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:53.480
<v Speaker 2>My wife hates fame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She hates wealth.</v>

922
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:57.920
<v Speaker 2>She hates red carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She ate all of it because she married me</v>

923
00:47:57.921 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 2>and her family was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

924
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.250
<v Speaker 2>got married him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is a loser.</v>

925
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.940
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to a but he's not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to amount to anything.</v>

926
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she married me because I'm the </v>

927
00:48:09.231 --> 00:48:13.460
<v Speaker 2>first out of every generation that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can find going back,</v>

928
00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm the first male that has not become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>baker.</v>

929
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:22.760
<v Speaker 2>And so I would probably probably be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chef in some place or A.</v>

930
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at baking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

931
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I was just gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you bake me a cake?</v>

932
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at baking pies.</v>

933
00:48:29.111 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 1>My father said baking</v>

934
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 2>sun is about formulas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cooking is winging it.</v>

935
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not good with formulas.</v>

936
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impatient.</v>

937
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.481
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

938
00:48:40.481 --> 00:48:41.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely a,</v>

939
00:48:41.481 --> 00:48:44.930
<v Speaker 1>a winging it Kinda guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So generally speaking,</v>

940
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.793
<v Speaker 1>do you feel it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first half of what we've done here </v>

941
00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.990
<v Speaker 1>was sorta fire and brimstone sorta or </v>
<v Speaker 1>laying out,</v>

942
00:48:50.991 --> 00:48:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

943
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.270
<v Speaker 1>this thing could really go off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rails.</v>

944
00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.210
<v Speaker 1>I think the last 20 minutes or so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a little more hopeful.</v>

945
00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:01.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm an optimistic catastrophist you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>not want me.</v>

946
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.313
<v Speaker 2>You do not want to be anywhere near me </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the titanic until we get to the </v>

947
00:49:07.191 --> 00:49:09.890
<v Speaker 2>iceberg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we're going to the iceberg,</v>

948
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding me?</v>

949
00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Have you counted</v>

950
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:13.900
<v Speaker 1>the lifeboats?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's not enough light bulbs.</v>

951
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 1>We're headed into cold area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there is,</v>

952
00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 1>if these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be irresponsible,</v>

953
00:49:19.421 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice,</v>

954
00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:21.904
<v Speaker 1>but they're arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gunna hit the iceberg and all </v>

955
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:25.703
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>

956
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soon as we hit that iceberg,</v>

957
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make it.</v>

958
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:35.290
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna make it because I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when people are awake,</v>

959
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 2>they will awaken to who they truly are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think Americans are different.</v>

960
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.330
<v Speaker 2>We have this spirit in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of exploration.</v>

961
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:51.340
<v Speaker 2>We're the people who crossed the oceans </v>
<v Speaker 2>were the people that cross the rockies.</v>

962
00:49:51.341 --> 00:49:52.174
<v Speaker 2>I have to tell you if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were alive during the time when we </v>

963
00:49:57.071 --> 00:49:59.570
<v Speaker 2>were exploring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I d,</v>

964
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think I would have made it </v>
<v Speaker 2>past the Missouri,</v>

965
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.370
<v Speaker 2>but definitely I would have gotten to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Denver and went,</v>

966
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:07.160
<v Speaker 2>okay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not knowing any.</v>

967
00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 2>We're not crossing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

968
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I always think every time I'm on the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

969
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.550
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The five a that goes by the,</v>

970
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:16.960
<v Speaker 2>the Getty Museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

971
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:17.794
<v Speaker 2>which is that</v>

972
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:18.401
<v Speaker 1>the four?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

973
00:50:18.401 --> 00:50:18.850
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

974
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.590
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

975
00:50:20.591 --> 00:50:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

976
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.980
<v Speaker 1>We bumped to La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

977
00:50:22.981 --> 00:50:23.814
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the getty museum up there and I </v>

978
00:50:25.991 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>think if I were a pioneer</v>

979
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.233
<v Speaker 2>and I made it this far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have built my house in this </v>

980
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:33.530
<v Speaker 2>valley and people would have been on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the hill going,</v>

981
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you should see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

982
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:36.583
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But generally people are explorers and </v>

983
00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:45.880
<v Speaker 2>they're good and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hardy and they want to live.</v>

984
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I think they do want to live and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to live</v>

985
00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.793
<v Speaker 2>in peace and harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that about the Palestinians and </v>

986
00:50:53.501 --> 00:50:56.020
<v Speaker 2>the Israelis when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could,</v>

987
00:50:56.021 --> 00:50:58.390
<v Speaker 2>and I've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>

988
00:50:59.140 --> 00:50:59.973
<v Speaker 2>When you don't have a camera in </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's face and nobody knows you're </v>

989
00:51:04.211 --> 00:51:05.044
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sit down in a house of Palestinian </v>

990
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.360
<v Speaker 2>and most likely average person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

991
00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just,</v>

992
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I want to raise my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be left alone.</v>

993
00:51:19.601 --> 00:51:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will maybe a little extra money,</v>

994
00:51:22.271 --> 00:51:24.520
<v Speaker 2>sole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can go off for a nice weekend.</v>

995
00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.013
<v Speaker 2>That's people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's when everybody starts telling them </v>

996
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.420
<v Speaker 2>it's them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

997
00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.910
<v Speaker 2>that's keeping you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when there's trouble.</v>

998
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You find it weird in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

999
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.633
<v Speaker 1>we're thought of as political beast </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in a certain way we really </v>

1000
00:51:40.531 --> 00:51:41.364
<v Speaker 1>haven't talked about politics here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I find now I'm probably less </v>

1001
00:51:45.991 --> 00:51:46.824
<v Speaker 1>interested in politics now today than </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever been in my adult life in a </v>

1002
00:51:51.961 --> 00:51:53.250
<v Speaker 1>bizarre way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1003
00:51:53.251 --> 00:51:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Like I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still love it at some level,</v>

1004
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.513
<v Speaker 1>but like what we're doing here and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real conversation happening </v>

1005
00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:02.640
<v Speaker 1>in the world right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not political.</v>

1006
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:03.623
<v Speaker 1>There's a class of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make everything political and </v>

1007
00:52:05.611 --> 00:52:07.310
<v Speaker 1>keep you confused and controlled.</v>

1008
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Flooding the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the latest,</v>

1009
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:10.940
<v Speaker 2>the Russians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not,</v>

1010
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:13.130
<v Speaker 2>the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of their,</v>

1011
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:17.300
<v Speaker 2>one of their campaigns happened when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1012
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember which was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>

1013
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.500
<v Speaker 2>the last star wars movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1014
00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did see this.</v>

1015
00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:23.930
<v Speaker 1>They said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1016
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.680
<v Speaker 1>the last Jedi that it was Russian bots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1017
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what Ryan Johnson,</v>

1018
00:52:28.251 --> 00:52:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

1019
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:29.803
<v Speaker 2>was there is evidence that they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were politicizing the movie that </v>

1020
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:37.730
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were putting out,</v>

1021
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.593
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to like that robot </v>

1022
00:52:39.951 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 2>because that robot,</v>

1023
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.150
<v Speaker 1>it's all about social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing it.</v>

1024
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:47.050
<v Speaker 1>The movie did suck and we okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you,</v>

1025
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:49.103
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is we have outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>influences that are trying to make </v>

1026
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:57.230
<v Speaker 2>everything about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read the book,</v>

1027
00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Defying Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best,</v>

1028
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 2>best explanation of what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

1029
00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:03.884
<v Speaker 2>Ever written by a guy at the time as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>warning to the west go and you don't </v>

1030
00:53:07.221 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 2>know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know where we've been.</v>

1031
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:10.790
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what's happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warning,</v>

1032
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.710
<v Speaker 2>and so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really gives you a,</v>

1033
00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.570
<v Speaker 2>a look at what was happening prior to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see it.</v>

1034
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

1035
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 2>that's the world trade center going </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1036
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's this.</v>

1037
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:23.720
<v Speaker 2>You can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're repeating it.</v>

1038
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.590
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1039
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:29.790
<v Speaker 2>right around 1933.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is not political.</v>

1040
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:32.250
<v Speaker 2>There's not one topic</v>

1041
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.770
<v Speaker 1>that is political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did this happen to us?</v>

1042
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1043
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I never watched cable news anymore and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even watch sports channels anymore</v>

1045
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:42.930
<v Speaker 1>because it's all political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm doing cardio I'll just flip</v>

1046
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:45.900
<v Speaker 1>channels and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to his political.</v>

1047
00:53:45.901 --> 00:53:48.840
<v Speaker 1>The view is now always political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're watching women's,</v>

1048
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:49.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically women's television in the </v>

1049
00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:53.730
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ESPN now is political all the time.</v>

1050
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:54.564
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every channel you probably turn on the </v>

1051
00:53:56.281 --> 00:53:58.720
<v Speaker 1>food channel and there's some political </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation happening.</v>

1052
00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Let me</v>

1053
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.390
<v Speaker 2>tell you something that I've never said </v>
<v Speaker 2>out loud.</v>

1054
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Only person I think that even knows it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my own company.</v>

1055
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stu,</v>

1056
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:08.363
<v Speaker 2>my executive producer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell you any of the names of </v>

1057
00:54:13.031 --> 00:54:14.890
<v Speaker 2>the people that are running for House </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Senate.</v>

1058
00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm on talk radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1059
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pay somebody to look at that.</v>

1060
00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what's the balance of the House </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the audience?</v>

1061
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:31.210
<v Speaker 2>It does not affect me one iota except in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big picture.</v>

1062
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Which movement is moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just it.</v>

1063
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.213
<v Speaker 1>It's a waste of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of how many man hours America has </v>

1064
00:54:44.311 --> 00:54:45.144
<v Speaker 1>lost in the last 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of what we could have done with </v>

1065
00:54:50.431 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 1>all of this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about the money.</v>

1066
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:54.543
<v Speaker 1>Is that the best argument for basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of classical liberalism or </v>

1067
00:54:57.121 --> 00:55:00.510
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism that if we could just </v>
<v Speaker 1>reign this thing in,</v>

1068
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.960
<v Speaker 1>that not only could you live however you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want it to live,</v>

1069
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:06.850
<v Speaker 1>basically if the government was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretended protecting your,</v>

1070
00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.270
<v Speaker 1>your life and your property rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your rights,</v>

1071
00:55:09.271 --> 00:55:11.850
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That not only would that be good because</v>

1072
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:12.684
<v Speaker 1>you can do what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would actually save you money </v>

1073
00:55:15.451 --> 00:55:16.670
<v Speaker 1>until.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1074
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.110
<v Speaker 1>he would heal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd still have it.</v>

1075
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.393
<v Speaker 1>You'd have it still on the local side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be great that that would </v>

1076
00:55:25.261 --> 00:55:27.930
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean is you'd still have</v>

1077
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:28.764
<v Speaker 1>people who would try to take the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>area and they'd be the big boss of the </v>

1078
00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:33.330
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd have those things you'd have,</v>

1079
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:34.164
<v Speaker 1>but at least you'd have a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over that you could control it </v>

1080
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.230
<v Speaker 1>or you could move to the next town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1081
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.760
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco can be as weird as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be.</v>

1082
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:47.400
<v Speaker 1>They could live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:55:47.401 --> 00:55:48.234
<v Speaker 1>six feet of human poop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine if that's what you want to </v>

1084
00:55:52.081 --> 00:55:52.914
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's an app for the human </v>

1085
00:55:54.121 --> 00:55:54.954
<v Speaker 1>poop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>

1086
00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:55.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually an APP that tells you </v>

1087
00:55:57.691 --> 00:55:59.940
<v Speaker 1>where human poop is on the streets in </v>
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco.</v>

1088
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.773
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

1089
00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:04.160
<v Speaker 2>literally going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1090
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.150
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1091
00:56:08.151 --> 00:56:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember saying,</v>

1092
00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I remember saying to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna come a time where you will</v>

1093
00:56:14.481 --> 00:56:15.314
<v Speaker 2>not recognize your country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you thought was solid will be </v>

1094
00:56:18.021 --> 00:56:20.840
<v Speaker 2>liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you thought was real will be false.</v>

1095
00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to it.</v>

1096
00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.800
<v Speaker 2>We're not only so far past that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>now to where you're like,</v>

1097
00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know who anyone is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what is real,</v>

1098
00:56:32.251 --> 00:56:34.200
<v Speaker 2>what's I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and down anymore.</v>

1099
00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:36.290
<v Speaker 2>We're so far past that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1100
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.060
<v Speaker 2>what's incredible and this is a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1101
00:56:39.061 --> 00:56:44.010
<v Speaker 2>or could be a good thing because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology by 20,</v>

1102
00:56:44.011 --> 00:56:46.670
<v Speaker 2>30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to recognize it.</v>

1103
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing will be the same.</v>

1104
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.113
<v Speaker 2>Nothing will be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be the difference between </v>

1105
00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:56.670
<v Speaker 2>looking at our lives in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

1106
00:56:56.671 --> 00:56:59.460
<v Speaker 2>looking back and go and tave you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember 20,</v>

1107
00:56:59.461 --> 00:57:00.294
<v Speaker 2>18 when we sat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be as different than as if we </v>

1108
00:57:04.021 --> 00:57:07.680
<v Speaker 2>were sitting in now and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1109
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:11.300
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine what 1920 was like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to</v>

1110
00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.660
<v Speaker 1>be that different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1111
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:13.494
<v Speaker 1>this reminds me of a line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed Peter Teal a couple of </v>

1112
00:57:15.271 --> 00:57:16.104
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago and he said that crypto is for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians and ai is for </v>

1113
00:57:21.331 --> 00:57:24.750
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians and I think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of gets to the heart of what you're</v>

1114
00:57:24.751 --> 00:57:29.070
<v Speaker 1>saying because maybe what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen here is that as our institutions,</v>

1115
00:57:29.071 --> 00:57:31.020
<v Speaker 1>our political institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>academic institutions,</v>

1116
00:57:31.021 --> 00:57:33.660
<v Speaker 1>media institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they become so big,</v>

1117
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.153
<v Speaker 1>they can't sustain themselves anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe we will sort of break off into </v>

1118
00:57:38.731 --> 00:57:41.720
<v Speaker 1>smaller communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means as well.</v>

1119
00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:42.563
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>

1120
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:44.803
<v Speaker 2>That's what the declaration of </v>
<v Speaker 2>independence and the constitution is </v>

1121
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.130
<v Speaker 2>encouraged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraged,</v>

1122
00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.770
<v Speaker 1>break off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your own thing.</v>

1123
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:53.740
<v Speaker 1>You should be a little laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a little laboratory.</v>

1124
00:57:53.741 --> 00:57:54.574
<v Speaker 1>You come up with something great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the other states and the other </v>

1125
00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:59.620
<v Speaker 1>cities will adopt it if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it works,</v>

1126
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.040
<v Speaker 1>we'll love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop,</v>

1127
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 1>stop the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1128
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:04.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not one experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we so,</v>

1129
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:05.943
<v Speaker 1>why are we so afraid of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I pushed that idea constantly </v>

1130
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:09.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1131
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:09.970
<v Speaker 1>just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

1132
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:12.790
<v Speaker 1>that the laboratory should exist so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want low taxes,</v>

1133
00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:13.624
<v Speaker 1>you go here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then if that screws over the </v>

1134
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then go somewhere else or whatever it is</v>

1135
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:17.464
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that play.</v>

1136
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:18.363
<v Speaker 1>But people are really afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that somehow we're not actually America </v>

1137
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:25.840
<v Speaker 1>if we don't live under the same exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws everywhere at which,</v>

1138
00:58:25.841 --> 00:58:26.674
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the antithesis of the founding </v>

1139
00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:28.864
<v Speaker 1>documents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people just have been convinced </v>

1140
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:31.474
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1141
00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.800
<v Speaker 2>people are not trustworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1142
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:38.940
<v Speaker 2>people aren't trustworthy if they never </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in trouble if they never.</v>

1143
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.013
<v Speaker 2>Banks are not trustworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they never have to pay for their own </v>

1144
00:58:43.951 --> 00:58:45.960
<v Speaker 2>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not trustworthy.</v>

1145
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.473
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have to pay for your own </v>

1146
00:58:48.511 --> 00:58:49.344
<v Speaker 2>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn that when people generally </v>

1147
00:58:50.881 --> 00:58:53.190
<v Speaker 2>become trustworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You brought up Peter Teal.</v>

1148
00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:57.660
<v Speaker 2>People ask me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you concerned about deeply?</v>

1149
00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about deep platforming,</v>

1150
00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:04.740
<v Speaker 2>big time and especially Dave with what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming with,</v>

1151
00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:09.770
<v Speaker 2>with deep fakes and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is trouble on the horizon.</v>

1152
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time somebody says something,</v>

1153
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1154
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.610
<v Speaker 2>the guy who can solve this because Peter</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teal,</v>

1155
00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:23.450
<v Speaker 2>because we need a platform and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>

1156
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.990
<v Speaker 2>A platform whose charter is the bill of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

1157
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.710
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you agree with the bill of rights and</v>

1158
00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:34.520
<v Speaker 2>you're not trying to shut anybody up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe in these things,</v>

1159
00:59:34.521 --> 00:59:36.890
<v Speaker 2>these human principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what make us human.</v>

1160
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Go on what you think on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not gonna kick anybody off.</v>

1161
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:40.784
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is this a place where speech will </v>

1162
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 2>be protected because thoughts are </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be dangerous.</v>

1163
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 2>It's only the dangerous thoughts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead us to the moon.</v>

1164
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:57.920
<v Speaker 2>It's only the dangerous thoughts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented television or the Internet.</v>

1165
00:59:57.921 --> 01:00:01.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a dangerous thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that said,</v>

1166
01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.540
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if I can make fire like the sky</v>
<v Speaker 2>does or that's a dangerous thought.</v>

1167
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.550
<v Speaker 2>You're going to burn everything down.</v>
