1
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is the founding editor </v>
<v Speaker 1>of clearly,</v>

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Thanks Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me.</v>

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I am thrilled to finally have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been like,</v>

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>87 years in the making.</v>

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.343
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live a very long way away so it's </v>

7
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:20.680
<v Speaker 2>difficult for me to get here.</v>

8
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you made it.</v>

9
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.993
<v Speaker 1>You made it thousands of miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are part of what I would say is idw </v>

10
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

12
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.791
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

13
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>so there's a ton I want to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

14
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:33.814
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I want to focus on Colette and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work that you're doing and we </v>

15
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:36.674
<v Speaker 1>obviously have a lot in common on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that we care about and things of </v>

16
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>that nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first off you are from Australia.</v>

17
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:46.421
<v Speaker 1>I've only had I think a two other guests</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are Australian natives on the show.</v>

18
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in Australia these days?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

19
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>what is the rest of the world needed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about Australia?</v>

20
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I would say that in Australia we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty chilled out at the moment,</v>

21
00:00:55.821 --> 00:01:00.821
<v Speaker 2>at least politically and culturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to America and even your,</v>

22
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 2>to a large extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a,</v>

23
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.963
<v Speaker 2>we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

24
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 2>25 years or more of economic growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people are pretty relaxed.</v>

25
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 2>People are doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle class is doing well.</v>

26
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.843
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not so much of a feeling that </v>

27
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:16.574
<v Speaker 2>there's a zero sum competition going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people are fighting over scarce </v>

28
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:20.264
<v Speaker 2>resources and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we obviously have political correctness </v>

29
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:28.781
<v Speaker 2>and identity politics and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's being imported from America.</v>

30
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that get important?</v>

31
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:32.294
<v Speaker 1>Because I was mentioning to you right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we started that a </v>

32
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:34.364
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate amount of our patrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who support this show more </v>

33
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if things are going pretty well,</v>

34
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a segment of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going,</v>

35
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>something's either not right or where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing the science be coming.</v>

36
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

37
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:47.794
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's difficult to identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly how these cultural trends get </v>

38
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 2>imported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

39
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through universities,</v>

40
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 2>through social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through traditional medium,</v>

41
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 2>so similar narratives get picked up by </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists like the oppression,</v>

42
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 2>narratives and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're seeing with the,</v>

43
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Speaker 2>with the young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger generations how the,</v>

44
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.983
<v Speaker 2>how they pick up ideology through social</v>
<v Speaker 2>media and through the echo chambers and </v>

45
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 2>the filter bubbles that are so easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>accessible.</v>

46
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.543
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there is a geographic </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that some of this stuff hasn't </v>

48
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>fully hit Australia yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>being surrounded by water and pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the rest of us,</v>

50
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a little bit of safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that I would imagine.</v>

51
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Although borders are changing just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of technology.</v>

52
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

53
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're more isolated,</v>

54
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With smaller.</v>

55
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't have the same.</v>

56
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 2>We're not as diverse as other places </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Europe and the United States.</v>

57
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 2>We have less income inequality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia which makes a.</v>

58
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

59
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>we're actually kind of parochial as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

60
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean we do pick up cultural trends </v>
<v Speaker 2>from America,</v>

61
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:07.744
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time we just focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking shows and reality TV and </v>

62
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 2>football games.</v>

63
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the article came out back in,</v>

64
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.260
<v Speaker 1>was it may or so the renegades of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual dark web,</v>

65
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>you were included in there and many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us had not even met you.</v>

66
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.223
<v Speaker 1>This is actually our first time meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in person even though we've been </v>

67
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:29.704
<v Speaker 1>chatting online for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you shocked about the reaction to </v>

68
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>that article because it really did sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of level up all of the issues that we've</v>

69
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:40.324
<v Speaker 1>been all talking about?</v>

70
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't shocked at all.</v>

71
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:47.881
<v Speaker 2>I think that the general movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ideas movement,</v>

72
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.183
<v Speaker 2>any pushback of the sort of moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>orthodoxy that the politically correct </v>

73
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:55.924
<v Speaker 2>left have at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been brewing for some time and </v>

74
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 2>someone just had to put a label on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone just had to name it.</v>

75
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.393
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't shocked by the groundswell of </v>

76
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 2>reaction to it because I've been seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it through my work with.</v>

77
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 2>There are just so many people who writes</v>
<v Speaker 2>me every day who say,</v>

78
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I love what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't write a blog myself.</v>

79
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:22.564
<v Speaker 2>I can't put my name on it because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get in trouble at work or in my </v>

80
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 2>university where there are so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who,</v>

81
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to participate in these discussions</v>

82
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 2>but can't for whatever reason and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 2>they like to be now be able to put a </v>
<v Speaker 2>label on this general movement.</v>

84
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me a little bit about your </v>

85
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:42.844
<v Speaker 1>personal background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What led you to be one of the people </v>

86
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:45.364
<v Speaker 1>that is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting your name on this stuff because </v>

87
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I do think that's one of the huge issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

88
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 1>We get all this support from academics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in politics and regular folks who</v>

89
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see the dangers,</v>

90
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to put my name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did Claire Lehman ended up here?</v>

91
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Willing to put your name and face to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff?</v>

92
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

93
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.953
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a bit more of a risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking streak in my nature and I don't </v>

94
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.150
<v Speaker 2>feel the same fear around social </v>
<v Speaker 2>disapproval as a lot of other people.</v>

95
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.233
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was a psychology graduate student </v>

96
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.560
<v Speaker 2>and I left my Grad program and before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>left I sort of,</v>

97
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 2>took a few risks during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during my program and,</v>

99
00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 2>and was sort of hung out to dry by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

100
00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:39.054
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

101
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.890
<v Speaker 1>An example of one of those sort of lit </v>
<v Speaker 1>up when you said it.</v>

102
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

103
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.513
<v Speaker 2>I complained about the amount of unpaid </v>
<v Speaker 2>work that psychology students had to do </v>

104
00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:50.774
<v Speaker 2>in a clinic that was associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>university and they weren't happy with </v>

105
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:55.514
<v Speaker 2>that and I sort of received a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>retaliation for sort of almost whistle </v>

106
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 2>blowing on the amount of exploitation </v>
<v Speaker 2>this clinic was involved in.</v>

107
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 2>So I've always said the first time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>took a risk,</v>

108
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.633
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always taken risks when I've felt </v>

109
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:16.631
<v Speaker 2>that my conscience demands that I do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what led me to create Colette was,</v>

110
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a graduate student,</v>

111
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>I was involved in a lot of online </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions with academics in psychology</v>

112
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.053
<v Speaker 2>and we had such fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting discussions that were </v>

113
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 2>completely unlike anything that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would see in mainstream media.</v>

114
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>firstly,</v>

115
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.144
<v Speaker 2>there's a business opportunity here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can bring some of these </v>

116
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 2>conversations to a market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and secondly,</v>

117
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to know that there are,</v>

118
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.473
<v Speaker 2>there is scientific evidence in some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these topics and mainstream journalists </v>

119
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 2>and neglecting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

120
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 2>inform readers about some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues or some of,</v>

121
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 2>some of this evidence.</v>

122
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to read the mission statement </v>

123
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:05.550
<v Speaker 1>from Colette because it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking perfect.</v>

124
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Colette is a platform for free thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We respect ideas,</v>

125
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.800
<v Speaker 1>even dangerous ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also believe that free expression and</v>

126
00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:17.670
<v Speaker 1>the free exchange of ideas help human </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies flourish and progress.</v>

127
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Quill that aims to provide a platform </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this exchange.</v>

128
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Everybody seems to be afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous ideas right now.</v>

129
00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:26.941
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

130
00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:27.774
<v Speaker 1>that's why this little crew of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are together for whatever our </v>

131
00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:31.980
<v Speaker 1>differences are.</v>

132
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a,</v>

133
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.193
<v Speaker 2>there's been a conflation between giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>a platform or exploring ideas and </v>

134
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 2>endorsing ideas and they're not the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

135
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.453
<v Speaker 2>So I will publish stuff on collect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily agree with </v>

136
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.270
<v Speaker 2>politically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

137
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the fact of publishing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

138
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.333
<v Speaker 2>necessarily as an endorsement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also am very clear that I'm going to </v>

139
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 2>make mistakes as an editor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

140
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.713
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to make mistakes about </v>
<v Speaker 2>accuracy and if we're ever called out </v>

141
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 2>for publishing something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>factually correct,</v>

142
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:18.100
<v Speaker 2>we will own up to that mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

143
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.943
<v Speaker 2>we're living in a time of intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological flux and to work out where </v>

144
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:25.574
<v Speaker 2>we're all going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to be able to talk about things </v>

145
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 2>freely and we need to be able to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistakes and I think make,</v>

146
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:32.654
<v Speaker 2>being able to make mistakes is a sign of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a healthy environment and it's a sign </v>

147
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:37.101
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:40.170
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the creative process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

149
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

150
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worry is who want to shut down,</v>

151
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:45.374
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who want to shut down free speech and </v>

152
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you that.</v>

153
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:50.264
<v Speaker 2>Giving a platform for exploring </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous ideas is equivalent to </v>

154
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:54.194
<v Speaker 2>endorsing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're basically that you can't make a </v>

155
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:59.080
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

156
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 2>that's really scary because the only way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we move forward is to experiment,</v>

157
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 2>test new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

158
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.440
<v Speaker 2>see what works and pick the best ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the,</v>

159
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 2>the experimentation process and move </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward that way.</v>

160
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to discuss some of the </v>

161
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:15.130
<v Speaker 1>dangerous ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

162
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:15.973
<v Speaker 1>That your platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting that you said this </v>

163
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:19.044
<v Speaker 1>thing about you don't mind making </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes because I feel very much the </v>

164
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:22.284
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will sit down with all sorts of </v>

165
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it before.</v>

166
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 1>People I agree with and disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people who I really don't like what</v>

167
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:28.704
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try to give everybody a fair </v>

168
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:31.224
<v Speaker 1>shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I'm noticing is there's a </v>

169
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of pushback just on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

170
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're getting to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that hey,</v>

171
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you can sit down with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate a human being from their ideas,</v>

172
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:42.834
<v Speaker 1>but also that there's this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary thing that I'm noticing and I </v>

173
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.044
<v Speaker 1>think you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get it too just from the articles </v>

174
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.294
<v Speaker 1>you guys put out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that if I don't ask the exact </v>

175
00:09:50.911 --> 00:09:55.911
<v Speaker 1>question that someone wants me to ask or</v>
<v Speaker 1>I miss this or I word this this way,</v>

176
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 1>but just this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this army that doesn't feel that organic</v>

177
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>to me is ready to pounce and I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to work through that.</v>

178
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't spend too much time </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>

179
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but it is a conscious thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

180
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be this group of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no matter what I do and really what</v>

181
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:12.894
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do is chill everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>out so that you'll only talk about what </v>

182
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:16.134
<v Speaker 1>they're comfortable with.</v>

183
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

184
00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:18.004
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people at the moment who feel </v>

185
00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:24.560
<v Speaker 2>that all the important questions have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been answered.</v>

186
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:30.070
<v Speaker 2>All of the important moral and ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>dilemmas have an answer and that at this</v>

187
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.164
<v Speaker 2>point in history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's been worked out and anyone </v>

188
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:36.554
<v Speaker 2>who's I'm exploring different ideas or </v>
<v Speaker 2>is doubtful about these moral issues is </v>

189
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.493
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

190
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

191
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I come,</v>

193
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I come from a different approach where </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

194
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.653
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm trying to work it out with </v>

195
00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:01.540
<v Speaker 2>other people and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the freedom to be able to explore</v>

196
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 1>in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that get you the most hate?</v>

197
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Because I think I really believe that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where most people are.</v>

198
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why people appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do here.</v>

199
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.234
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being open about my journey and</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to people and learning all of </v>

200
00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:15.890
<v Speaker 1>that and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that opens you up from hate from the</v>

201
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.733
<v Speaker 1>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to just stake out a </v>

202
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 1>position and then you'll only get hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>one way,</v>

203
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 1>but when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am going to hear both sides,</v>

204
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:23.874
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's why I love listening to Sam Harris </v>

205
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>and Jordan Peterson debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:29.820
<v Speaker 1>the biggest existential questions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

207
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

208
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.960
<v Speaker 1>if I've completely settled my mind on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

209
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.263
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be that impressed with my </v>

210
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.280
<v Speaker 1>thought process or something.</v>

211
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

212
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get a lot of hate.</v>

213
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.420
<v Speaker 2>I certainly have twitter trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

214
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.033
<v Speaker 1>way too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

215
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of don't really notice it.</v>

216
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

217
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the most simple way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with this.</v>

218
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

219
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about some of those dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

220
00:11:56.351 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 1>What are some dangerous ideas that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbled up from your writers that you've</v>

221
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 1>had to think about or that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on these days?</v>

222
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because my background is in </v>

223
00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

224
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.280
<v Speaker 2>we tackle issues that come from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral sciences.</v>

225
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.173
<v Speaker 2>So we've looked at sex differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological sex differences between </v>

226
00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:24.420
<v Speaker 2>men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences in interests in occupations.</v>

227
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:25.883
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've published some articles on why </v>

228
00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:31.920
<v Speaker 2>there are fewer women in computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

229
00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:34.350
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

230
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.303
<v Speaker 2>we published a analysis of Jameson was </v>
<v Speaker 2>google memo written by four different </v>

231
00:12:40.471 --> 00:12:43.080
<v Speaker 2>scientists who have some expertise in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that area.</v>

232
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've published on intelligence reports.</v>

233
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.020
<v Speaker 1>What were some of the results?</v>

234
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they,</v>

235
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically said that something </v>

236
00:12:55.551 --> 00:12:59.810
<v Speaker 2>pretty similar that he was in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballpark in terms of getting the science</v>

237
00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:04.811
<v Speaker 2>right and he's position is valid in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of regular scientific debate.</v>

238
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.430
<v Speaker 2>There are observable sex differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>between men and women.</v>

239
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 2>The differences in interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupations is very robust and reliable,</v>

240
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.373
<v Speaker 2>so women are overwhelmingly interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in occupations which have something to </v>

241
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:26.510
<v Speaker 2>do with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so caring professions,</v>

242
00:13:26.511 --> 00:13:27.344
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even law whereas men have more interest </v>

243
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:35.420
<v Speaker 2>in occupations that are to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems and things,</v>

244
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.980
<v Speaker 2>so anything mechanical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer science and there's no,</v>

245
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.353
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average intelligent school is between </v>

246
00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:44.984
<v Speaker 2>men and women and the evidence around </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences in verbal and mathematical </v>

247
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.360
<v Speaker 2>ability is somewhat mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mean you can,</v>

248
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.223
<v Speaker 2>you can have debates backwards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forwards over the strengths of those </v>

249
00:13:56.991 --> 00:13:57.824
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the difference in interest is very </v>

250
00:14:00.201 --> 00:14:00.980
<v Speaker 2>robust.</v>

251
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.813
<v Speaker 1>Why are people so afraid of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that there is a set of people </v>

252
00:14:06.891 --> 00:14:11.600
<v Speaker 1>out there right now that want us to add </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be all equal in their minds,</v>

253
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:15.200
<v Speaker 1>but it would actually force us to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>against nature.</v>

254
00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this really is.</v>

255
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a fear that if you acknowledge </v>

256
00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:26.450
<v Speaker 2>that there are differences between </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals or groups,</v>

257
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.110
<v Speaker 2>that you're saying that one group is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inferior,</v>

258
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.700
<v Speaker 2>so there's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

259
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.923
<v Speaker 2>the idea that we have to be the same to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be equal has been a very prevalent and </v>

260
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:42.464
<v Speaker 2>strong idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who came where the idea </v>

261
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:47.300
<v Speaker 2>comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

262
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

263
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.660
<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

264
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 2>if you argue that no true equality can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be achieved,</v>

265
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.230
<v Speaker 2>unless we're all the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then no,</v>

266
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Speaker 2>then we can't have a quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

267
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:02.594
<v Speaker 2>if you argue that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are all morally equal and that we </v>

268
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 2>deserve equal opportunity and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the equal,</v>

269
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

270
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we deserve equal opportunities to live a</v>

271
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flourishing life.</v>

272
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.940
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are differences between us.</v>

273
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Then you can preserve that ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle.</v>

274
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:25.993
<v Speaker 2>So it's very problematic for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that there can be no equality </v>

275
00:15:30.321 --> 00:15:31.154
<v Speaker 2>between men and women unless we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>proven to be the same identical because </v>

276
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 2>the evidence doesn't support the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're the same.</v>

277
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:41.803
<v Speaker 2>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are some of the other dangerous </v>

278
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.941
<v Speaker 2>ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

279
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:44.774
<v Speaker 2>So we've</v>

280
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.230
<v Speaker 1>the dangerous role.</v>

281
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

282
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:47.904
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've published work on intelligence </v>

283
00:15:50.011 --> 00:15:52.110
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is controversial.</v>

284
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've published articles about the</v>

285
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.703
<v Speaker 1>heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about intelligence and </v>

286
00:15:57.941 --> 00:15:58.774
<v Speaker 1>race?</v>

287
00:15:59.130 --> 00:15:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

288
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.700
<v Speaker 1>This seems to be one of their people </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be all</v>

289
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.240
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

290
00:16:03.241 --> 00:16:06.170
<v Speaker 2>that's a hugely controversial issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

291
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 2>we've published,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

292
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.563
<v Speaker 2>we published a defense of the child's </v>
<v Speaker 2>marries the bell curve because after he </v>

293
00:16:15.001 --> 00:16:15.834
<v Speaker 2>had his conversation with Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vox came out and wrote a hit piece or </v>

294
00:16:22.141 --> 00:16:24.870
<v Speaker 2>right at some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of article that misrepresented</v>

295
00:16:24.871 --> 00:16:27.480
<v Speaker 2>what they talked about and the bell </v>
<v Speaker 2>curve.</v>

296
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.793
<v Speaker 2>And so we published a response from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Richard Hire who's the editor </v>

297
00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:36.384
<v Speaker 2>of the intelligence journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's a preeminent expert in this </v>

298
00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:40.584
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he defended Charles Murray's book </v>

299
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.940
<v Speaker 2>and defended the conversation that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had and said this is an important issue.</v>

300
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.360
<v Speaker 2>It's scientifically valid and has merit </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about these issues.</v>

301
00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:55.750
<v Speaker 2>And they got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

302
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.740
<v Speaker 2>they got the science right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

303
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.503
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't aim to be provocative for the </v>

304
00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:07.980
<v Speaker 2>sake of just being inflammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

305
00:17:07.981 --> 00:17:08.814
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an objective where we want to </v>

306
00:17:11.221 --> 00:17:12.054
<v Speaker 2>protect the scientists who are having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are doing this work or who are </v>

307
00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:16.554
<v Speaker 2>having these conversations we want us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to protect the individuals who </v>

308
00:17:22.051 --> 00:17:22.884
<v Speaker 2>are doing the knowledge production or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the research we want to protect them </v>

309
00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:30.354
<v Speaker 2>from the boxes and the journalists who </v>
<v Speaker 2>just want to write hate pieces just to </v>

310
00:17:35.791 --> 00:17:40.110
<v Speaker 2>get the clicks so we have a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment to those people who are doing</v>

311
00:17:40.111 --> 00:17:42.510
<v Speaker 2>risky work and need that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>protection.</v>

312
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.520
<v Speaker 1>You're going to my soft spot today </v>
<v Speaker 1>because as,</v>

313
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.020
<v Speaker 1>as we're taking this as we're taping </v>
<v Speaker 1>this only like an hour ago,</v>

314
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:51.870
<v Speaker 1>vox did a piece about me about how I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reactionary right?</v>

315
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like you guys are awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when a weird way your,</v>

316
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.423
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job in some respects has become </v>

317
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:00.834
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a force field to just allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do the work that they're </v>

318
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:05.750
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be doing.</v>

319
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>

320
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.533
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because universities for all sorts of </v>

321
00:18:10.031 --> 00:18:11.650
<v Speaker 2>different reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

322
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:17.040
<v Speaker 2>neglecting their duty to academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and academic freedom is meant to</v>

323
00:18:18.701 --> 00:18:23.701
<v Speaker 2>exist to protect scientists in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular who are doing work,</v>

324
00:18:23.981 --> 00:18:24.814
<v Speaker 2>which contradicts the religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>orthodoxy of the time or the moral </v>

325
00:18:29.621 --> 00:18:30.454
<v Speaker 2>orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's quite clear to me that there </v>

326
00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:32.434
<v Speaker 2>are scientists doing work which </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges politically correct dogmas </v>

327
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.553
<v Speaker 2>and I don't see universities doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good job at protecting those </v>

328
00:18:42.011 --> 00:18:46.780
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we feel like we can fill the gap.</v>

329
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.253
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you think the gender studies </v>

330
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.593
<v Speaker 1>stuff fits into all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in a weird way it seems like </v>

331
00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:57.110
<v Speaker 1>it's all being whittled down to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow that now,</v>

332
00:18:57.111 --> 00:18:57.944
<v Speaker 1>especially related to trans issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just talking to a fairly well </v>

333
00:19:01.731 --> 00:19:02.564
<v Speaker 1>known public professor yesterday off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>record about how he's going into his </v>

334
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.363
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he's factually correct and </v>

335
00:19:10.611 --> 00:19:11.420
<v Speaker 1>it's calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.253
<v Speaker 1>confident about his research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going into old lesson plans to </v>

337
00:19:14.691 --> 00:19:18.230
<v Speaker 1>change wording just because he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to deal with the mob.</v>

338
00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:20.870
<v Speaker 1>So things that were completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable three,</v>

339
00:19:20.871 --> 00:19:23.210
<v Speaker 1>four years ago is now having to edit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

340
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

341
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.733
<v Speaker 1>that's truly dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is going on with the gender </v>

342
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:28.260
<v Speaker 1>studies department and the rest of this</v>

343
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 2>moving so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to really,</v>

344
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:33.384
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to analyze what's going on when it's </v>

345
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.043
<v Speaker 2>shifting so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But certainly many of the humanities </v>

346
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:46.050
<v Speaker 2>departments took a turn back in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies and they took,</v>

347
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

348
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.430
<v Speaker 2>took on these fashionable theories such </v>
<v Speaker 2>as poststructuralism and uh,</v>

349
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.520
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they rejected empirical methods.</v>

350
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.443
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

351
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.033
<v Speaker 1>and so then the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were trying to give them the </v>

352
00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:03.670
<v Speaker 1>credit that they're due,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the argument,</v>

353
00:20:03.671 --> 00:20:06.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're rejecting empirical science or</v>

354
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.613
<v Speaker 1>verbal facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your argument that leads you </v>

355
00:20:09.281 --> 00:20:10.114
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know people are watching us </v>

356
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:12.880
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just sounds crazy,</v>

357
00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.090
<v Speaker 1>but they obviously believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's try to give the devil his deal,</v>

358
00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:16.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:20:16.361 --> 00:20:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

360
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.443
<v Speaker 2>postmodernist have a good point and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we are all biased and a </v>

361
00:20:22.551 --> 00:20:26.150
<v Speaker 2>scientist looking at an issue such as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

362
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:31.270
<v Speaker 2>sexuality has his or her own biases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

363
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.850
<v Speaker 2>And so the questions that the scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>asks when he or her,</v>

364
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.320
<v Speaker 2>he or she is designing a survey or </v>
<v Speaker 2>designing a lab experiment,</v>

365
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have some bias embedded </v>
<v Speaker 2>within them.</v>

366
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.700
<v Speaker 2>So that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the postmodernist had that insight.</v>

367
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.913
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mistake they make is getting rid of </v>

368
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.283
<v Speaker 2>an empirical and objective methods all </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and just saying because we're </v>

369
00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 2>biased,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the point?</v>

370
00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.773
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing like a massive </v>

371
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:01.040
<v Speaker 1>overcorrection</v>

372
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.300
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

373
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.280
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

374
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.380
<v Speaker 2>what should be done is acknowledging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

375
00:21:06.381 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 2>we all have our bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

376
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.420
<v Speaker 2>and if I'm a scientist designing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>

377
00:21:11.421 --> 00:21:12.254
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have my bias and it might </v>
<v Speaker 2>get embedded into the work that I'm </v>

378
00:21:14.901 --> 00:21:16.340
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

379
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.473
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to correct that and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to improve our quantitative </v>

380
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.170
<v Speaker 2>methodologies in order to correct for </v>
<v Speaker 2>our own biases.</v>

381
00:21:24.171 --> 00:21:27.260
<v Speaker 2>So the problem that the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 2>have is that they say,</v>

382
00:21:27.261 --> 00:21:30.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bias is there,</v>

383
00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:30.914
<v Speaker 2>so let's put it all in the bin and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to double down on the bias </v>

384
00:21:33.531 --> 00:21:36.470
<v Speaker 2>and just talk about lived experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

385
00:21:36.471 --> 00:21:39.500
<v Speaker 2>that is just taking the completely the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong direction,</v>

386
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.131
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

387
00:21:40.131 --> 00:21:42.500
<v Speaker 1>it's quite literally the reverse of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific method,</v>

388
00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:46.340
<v Speaker 1>so basically they're saying that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias is truth,</v>

389
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.233
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're saying bias that the </v>

390
00:21:48.621 --> 00:21:51.680
<v Speaker 1>lived experience is what truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then bias is true.</v>

391
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw it,</v>

392
00:21:52.551 --> 00:21:55.370
<v Speaker 1>but I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this talk at University of New Hampshire</v>

393
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.540
<v Speaker 1>and this woman was yelling at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this trans woman calling me all right,</v>

394
00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:01.580
<v Speaker 1>and all of this other nonsense shouting </v>
<v Speaker 1>me down.</v>

395
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize this till two months </v>
<v Speaker 1>later or something,</v>

396
00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:06.770
<v Speaker 1>but it turned out she was a gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies professor at the school.</v>

397
00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.270
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a gender studies professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to shout down and invited speaker</v>

398
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.700
<v Speaker 1>while live tweeting that I'm alright or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

399
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.643
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure maybe I'm not right </v>

400
00:22:16.731 --> 00:22:18.390
<v Speaker 1>about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll concede on that.</v>

401
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.303
<v Speaker 1>Even though I wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said she should be treated with </v>

402
00:22:20.451 --> 00:22:21.284
<v Speaker 1>respect and equality and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your bias that you're acting on </v>

403
00:22:26.301 --> 00:22:27.134
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely is not closer to truth </v>

404
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.780
<v Speaker 1>than what I was saying.</v>

405
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I.</v>

406
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.320
<v Speaker 2>The way I think of it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:22:34.321 --> 00:22:35.154
<v Speaker 2>there is an objective reality and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way we get to objective realities </v>

408
00:22:39.481 --> 00:22:41.380
<v Speaker 2>through the scientific method,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

409
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.833
<v Speaker 2>whereas post modernists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>academics believe a lot of them believe </v>

410
00:22:46.681 --> 00:22:47.514
<v Speaker 2>that reality is created through language</v>
<v Speaker 2>and discourse and I think that's one of </v>

411
00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:53.694
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why they believe that words </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be violence because if reality is </v>

412
00:22:57.421 --> 00:23:02.421
<v Speaker 2>actually created three language and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse and there's some kind of,</v>

413
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.313
<v Speaker 2>there's some toxic discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they truly believed that reality </v>

414
00:23:07.471 --> 00:23:08.304
<v Speaker 2>can be changed through words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that's why they get so </v>

415
00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:12.534
<v Speaker 2>upset about freedom of speech and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>having discussions because they truly </v>

416
00:23:17.821 --> 00:23:21.420
<v Speaker 2>believe that words can change the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is constructed.</v>

417
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for now they say it's okay to punch a</v>

418
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

419
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:26.404
<v Speaker 1>they call everybody Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's okay to punch a Nazi and then </v>

420
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 1>we can go however far down that road we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go.</v>

421
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And then then you're completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>condoning mines.</v>

422
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:35.763
<v Speaker 1>How concerned are you that these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to trickle up higher into </v>

423
00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 1>places of power and that once they look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know they're in the media.</v>

424
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>You've already mentioned box and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of those other,</v>

425
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.510
<v Speaker 2>but that once they're really into places</v>
<v Speaker 2>of power in Australia,</v>

426
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.353
<v Speaker 2>in the states or wherever else that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screws are really going to be turned </v>

427
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:54.524
<v Speaker 2>against us because we're fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech would mostly be concerned </v>

428
00:24:00.081 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 2>about these ideas getting into the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traditionally,</v>

429
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:05.234
<v Speaker 2>the lore is a conservative field and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are pretty good at resisting </v>

430
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 2>political fads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see with the way that law is</v>

431
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:16.424
<v Speaker 2>taught in law schools at the moment that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is critical legal studies and </v>

432
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:25.070
<v Speaker 2>often critical legal studies is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandatory component.</v>

433
00:24:25.071 --> 00:24:25.904
<v Speaker 2>So they teach like the feminist </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of law and these </v>

434
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.110
<v Speaker 2>approaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

435
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.173
<v Speaker 2>can undermine some of the basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals of foundations of how the </v>

436
00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Lord is meant to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

437
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.333
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am worried that there are a lot of </v>

438
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:46.424
<v Speaker 2>attacks on due process at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech and the scientific </v>

439
00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:51.584
<v Speaker 2>method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those three things are foundations of a </v>

440
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:59.150
<v Speaker 2>civilized society and all of them are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being attacked at the moment.</v>

441
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.590
<v Speaker 2>How does me to fit into this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you've been somewhat critical of</v>

442
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:06.350
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all three of those criteria</v>

443
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 2>that you just laid out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

444
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:08.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously me to started as a really </v>

445
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:16.331
<v Speaker 2>legitimate and powerful movement in </v>
<v Speaker 2>identifying the,</v>

446
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.870
<v Speaker 2>the predation that Harvey Weinstein was </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in.</v>

447
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and surely there are,</v>

448
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.740
<v Speaker 2>there have been many powerful men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

449
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.033
<v Speaker 2>in the last couple of decades working in</v>
<v Speaker 2>industries where there's a lot of young </v>

450
00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:31.874
<v Speaker 2>women around and they have positions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power and they're able to exploit those </v>

451
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

452
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:40.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a young woman myself,</v>

453
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

454
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't see sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

455
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:49.100
<v Speaker 2>as being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as pervasive as a lot of people claim.</v>

456
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:54.310
<v Speaker 2>And I also think it's very dangerous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make accusations against people publicly</v>

457
00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.800
<v Speaker 2>because our reputations are so valuable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so important that,</v>

458
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:26:03.051 --> 00:26:03.884
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to respect other people's </v>

460
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.390
<v Speaker 2>ability to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have their,</v>

461
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 2>their reputation and I'm making </v>
<v Speaker 2>accusations in public,</v>

462
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:14.450
<v Speaker 2>sort of goes against my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

463
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.350
<v Speaker 2>my feeling that it feels indicative to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and it feels dangerous,</v>

464
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.540
<v Speaker 2>dangerous path to go down because for </v>
<v Speaker 2>every true accusation,</v>

465
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:30.050
<v Speaker 2>they ease of sexual harassment and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be someone who is,</v>

466
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:33.914
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are going to be people who have </v>

468
00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:35.474
<v Speaker 2>conflicts and then the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone feels like they can resolve a </v>

469
00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:41.690
<v Speaker 2>conflict through making an accusation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment.</v>

470
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

471
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 2>we don't want people to resolve their </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicts by making public accusations.</v>

472
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I definitely think there's a certain</v>

473
00:26:49.011 --> 00:26:51.500
<v Speaker 1>set of people that don't mind collateral</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>

474
00:26:51.501 --> 00:26:51.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

475
00:26:51.981 --> 00:26:53.390
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be what's happening right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

476
00:26:53.391 --> 00:26:54.710
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this public,</v>

477
00:26:54.711 --> 00:26:56.330
<v Speaker 1>people that are tweeting these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

478
00:26:56.331 --> 00:26:59.870
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't matter if you can take </v>
<v Speaker 1>down a couple of innocent people.</v>

479
00:26:59.871 --> 00:27:00.704
<v Speaker 1>That's how dangerous this thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That strikes me as far more dangerous </v>

480
00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:04.874
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not belittling any of the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that some of these women have </v>

481
00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.040
<v Speaker 1>gone through.</v>

482
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's scary.</v>

483
00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.283
<v Speaker 2>It's the desire for collective </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment and that collective </v>

484
00:27:17.741 --> 00:27:18.574
<v Speaker 2>punishment is is is scary it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the Geneva Convention </v>

485
00:27:25.301 --> 00:27:27.790
<v Speaker 2>that was established after World War </v>
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>

486
00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:33.570
<v Speaker 2>the UN declared collective punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a war crime,</v>

487
00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.103
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is that when there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict between ethnic groups in </v>

488
00:27:39.431 --> 00:27:43.000
<v Speaker 2>certain places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if if one,</v>

489
00:27:43.001 --> 00:27:45.880
<v Speaker 2>if some people are killed in that inner </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict,</v>

490
00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.773
<v Speaker 2>you can't then go and wipe out a village</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a collective collective rich </v>

491
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.260
<v Speaker 2>retribution because that's how these war</v>
<v Speaker 2>crimes happen.</v>

492
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.700
<v Speaker 2>So now we're this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like you said,</v>

493
00:27:57.701 --> 00:27:58.534
<v Speaker 2>this collateral damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this desire for collateral damage is </v>

494
00:28:01.071 --> 00:28:04.210
<v Speaker 2>being normalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people don't seem to understand how</v>

495
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.200
<v Speaker 2>dangerous this is and how unjust it is.</v>

496
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.740
<v Speaker 1>What is part of the issue that perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do understand it,</v>

497
00:28:11.741 --> 00:28:16.741
<v Speaker 1>but they so want to destroy the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been on tour with Jordan Peterson.</v>

498
00:28:16.961 --> 00:28:20.290
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he's been talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a lot lately is yes,</v>

499
00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you can acknowledge that we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect systems and then there's perfect</v>

500
00:28:23.771 --> 00:28:25.660
<v Speaker 1>systems are probably impossible to ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to,</v>

501
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but now we have this new thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

502
00:28:28.841 --> 00:28:32.940
<v Speaker 1>which is let's just freaking destroy the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing to build our perfect system.</v>

503
00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:33.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people don't understand because </v>

504
00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.240
<v Speaker 2>we're not taught anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not taught history properly.</v>

505
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:42.074
<v Speaker 2>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't learn about human nature in </v>

506
00:28:44.331 --> 00:28:49.331
<v Speaker 2>school and how it's almost an instinct </v>
<v Speaker 2>to want to desire retribution,</v>

507
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.190
<v Speaker 2>retribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vindictive justice.</v>

508
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:53.024
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of our nature is to want to </v>

509
00:28:55.101 --> 00:28:59.030
<v Speaker 2>punish people and punish groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

510
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.540
<v Speaker 2>and now institutions like a g process </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the presumption of innocence,</v>

511
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.940
<v Speaker 2>they sort of go against our instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why they say,</v>

512
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:11.271
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

513
00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:12.104
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what we're seeing is just </v>

514
00:29:13.521 --> 00:29:16.400
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a regression back to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>more tribal,</v>

515
00:29:16.401 --> 00:29:17.234
<v Speaker 2>instinctive nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because our education system is so </v>

516
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:21.883
<v Speaker 2>atrophied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young people aren't being taught the </v>

517
00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:27.830
<v Speaker 2>value and the fragility of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions,</v>

518
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.260
<v Speaker 2>how they came about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they're so important,</v>

519
00:29:30.261 --> 00:29:31.094
<v Speaker 2>why we must protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's just a basic </v>

520
00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:34.454
<v Speaker 2>ignorance about why these institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions exist in the first place </v>

521
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 2>and then we're regressing to our more </v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive natures.</v>

522
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you think social media fits into </v>

523
00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:46.830
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I did a video,</v>

524
00:29:46.831 --> 00:29:47.664
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost three years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that online culture is becoming </v>

525
00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:53.870
<v Speaker 1>mainstream culture and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're seeing there.</v>

526
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.733
<v Speaker 1>What used to be just relegated to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meme makers and peppy people has now </v>

527
00:29:58.291 --> 00:29:59.124
<v Speaker 1>just leaked everywhere and just everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in public is acting sort of as their </v>

528
00:30:04.021 --> 00:30:07.440
<v Speaker 1>worst selves over time that feeds all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

529
00:30:07.441 --> 00:30:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's either destroy the system or let's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore legitimate problems.</v>

530
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.073
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't have proper law and </v>

531
00:30:13.191 --> 00:30:14.024
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do get more justice in vigilante </v>

532
00:30:15.771 --> 00:30:16.604
<v Speaker 2>justice in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see that throughout history </v>

533
00:30:18.861 --> 00:30:21.200
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get lynchings.</v>

534
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get pogroms,</v>

535
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.483
<v Speaker 2>you get groups like mobs of people going</v>
<v Speaker 2>and attacking an individual who they </v>

536
00:30:30.201 --> 00:30:35.090
<v Speaker 2>think is guilty of like a sex crime or </v>
<v Speaker 2>some other crime and killing the person.</v>

537
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what happened was,</v>

538
00:30:37.851 --> 00:30:42.020
<v Speaker 2>is we developed legal and social norms </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stopped,</v>

539
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:42.883
<v Speaker 2>that kind of vigilante justice from </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking place and if you are a vigilante </v>

540
00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:47.444
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get in trouble with the law and </v>

541
00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.713
<v Speaker 2>then we've developed social norms that </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent people from just forming mobs </v>

542
00:30:54.201 --> 00:30:56.060
<v Speaker 2>and going attacking people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

543
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.553
<v Speaker 2>But social media is this new technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we haven't developed any of the </v>

544
00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:06.401
<v Speaker 2>legal or social norms yet and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought back this mobbing behavior,</v>

545
00:31:06.711 --> 00:31:09.770
<v Speaker 2>which is part of our nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brought it back.</v>

546
00:31:09.771 --> 00:31:14.600
<v Speaker 2>But we haven't yet developed any of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>norms to sort of suppress it or mitigate</v>

547
00:31:14.601 --> 00:31:15.434
<v Speaker 2>against it and I think we eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>will develop these norms but it's gonna </v>

548
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.010
<v Speaker 2>take awhile and there's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>feat.</v>

549
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Innocent people sort of metaphorically </v>
<v Speaker 2>lynched in the process.</v>

550
00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:25.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually an interesting segue </v>

551
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 1>to something that's been on my mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>

552
00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:28.954
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones got booted from twitter and </v>

553
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:32.314
<v Speaker 1>Youtube and facebook or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to talk about any of </v>

554
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 1>the things that he talks about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not matter,</v>

555
00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.553
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these tech companies basically </v>

556
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 1>decided that this one guy is too </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

557
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:45.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erica and can be on here and Hamas,</v>

558
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.363
<v Speaker 1>whoever you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever else you want to pick that you </v>

559
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 1>don't like can be on your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>

560
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:51.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even paypal took them out last week.</v>

561
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.443
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that the free speech crew </v>

562
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.293
<v Speaker 1>for getting his ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think we should have offered a </v>

563
00:31:58.211 --> 00:31:59.044
<v Speaker 1>better defense of why this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person should be allowed to use these </v>

564
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:04.110
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

565
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.280
<v Speaker 1>should guy be allowed to make a phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>call?</v>

566
00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:07.114
<v Speaker 1>Should he allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should he be allowed to have running </v>

567
00:32:08.141 --> 00:32:10.810
<v Speaker 1>water at his house?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do we draw the lines for days?</v>

568
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think these tools that we use </v>

569
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 2>such as payment processing and social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media such as twitter,</v>

570
00:32:18.821 --> 00:32:19.654
<v Speaker 2>the instant messaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their tools and they should be treated </v>

571
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as such,</v>

572
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:28.330
<v Speaker 2>like having electricity or water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

573
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.530
<v Speaker 1>so you believe there are public good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the same work,</v>

574
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.590
<v Speaker 1>getting water to your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the phone line connected to your</v>

575
00:32:34.591 --> 00:32:34.790
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

576
00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

577
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:37.243
<v Speaker 2>and they shouldn't be politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you politicize these </v>

578
00:32:40.701 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>

579
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a slippery slope and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's going to be arguments about</v>

580
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:50.690
<v Speaker 2>who do we band next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what standards do we want to sit in,</v>

581
00:32:50.691 --> 00:32:54.530
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the context of Alex Jones,</v>

582
00:32:54.531 --> 00:32:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

583
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably more to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story that the public is aware of.</v>

584
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want to comment on him </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>

585
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:02.570
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to make it a bit.</v>

586
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the general idea that a </v>

587
00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.493
<v Speaker 1>digital assassination can occur because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all agreeing to terms of services </v>

588
00:33:09.251 --> 00:33:10.084
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not sitting around with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer every time I click accept to the </v>

589
00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:16.870
<v Speaker 1>new service and that eventually you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could move on.</v>

590
00:33:16.871 --> 00:33:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

591
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.233
<v Speaker 1>We know the way these ideas work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get one person and then </v>

592
00:33:20.981 --> 00:33:22.240
<v Speaker 1>suddenly be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

593
00:33:22.241 --> 00:33:24.040
<v Speaker 1>well we're good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

594
00:33:24.041 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 1>who do you get net?</v>

595
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

596
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 2>the payment and processing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is scary.</v>

597
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea that that should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicized is just.</v>

598
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:33.260
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

599
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think the solution is?</v>

600
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably know what my </v>

601
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.310
<v Speaker 1>solution is that we need more </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

602
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.770
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really understanding of big </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter to that because it's like,</v>

603
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 1>where is the county?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is it?</v>

604
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

605
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.593
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the onset and I tend </v>

606
00:33:50.371 --> 00:33:55.371
<v Speaker 2>towards being um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economically liberal.</v>

607
00:33:55.561 --> 00:33:58.440
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these tools,</v>

608
00:33:58.441 --> 00:33:59.274
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are public goods and perhaps need to be </v>

609
00:34:01.681 --> 00:34:05.310
<v Speaker 2>thought of as public goods rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than private.</v>

610
00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.080
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

611
00:34:07.081 --> 00:34:10.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to ideas of regulation,</v>

612
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.500
<v Speaker 2>government intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

613
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.633
<v Speaker 2>I'm also open to ideas about breaking up</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the monopolies because we </v>

614
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.433
<v Speaker 2>competition would be lovely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bit difficult at the moment </v>

615
00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:25.374
<v Speaker 2>because some of these companies have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten monopolies in lots of different </v>

616
00:34:30.571 --> 00:34:32.310
<v Speaker 2>verticals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Google,</v>

617
00:34:32.311 --> 00:34:33.144
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the search engine monopoly they've </v>

618
00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:38.220
<v Speaker 2>got that almost got the advertising </v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly,</v>

619
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:41.970
<v Speaker 2>so they're leveraging their monopoly in </v>
<v Speaker 2>one area into others.</v>

620
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.730
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just shuts down competition.</v>

621
00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:45.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's even something a </v>

622
00:34:46.091 --> 00:34:48.550
<v Speaker 1>little more perverse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

623
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:49.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

624
00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:51.610
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously I'm not blowing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lid on anything here.</v>

625
00:34:51.611 --> 00:34:54.880
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously tons of discussions </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all sorts of people about how do we</v>

626
00:34:54.881 --> 00:34:57.220
<v Speaker 1>compete with youtube or how do we </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete with any of these things,</v>

627
00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.880
<v Speaker 1>but I think partly what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just people are going there,</v>

628
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.630
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big monolith.</v>

629
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I think people are actually genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of what it means to go up against</v>

630
00:35:05.741 --> 00:35:06.574
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's going to just be a </v>

631
00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:08.104
<v Speaker 1>hard work situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what does it actually mean to </v>

632
00:35:11.291 --> 00:35:13.870
<v Speaker 1>go up against the world's information </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader</v>

633
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.810
<v Speaker 2>can compete against the monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the definition of a monopoly.</v>

634
00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 2>That's no competition and these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these companies,</v>

635
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:21.943
<v Speaker 2>I'm not police and they have captured </v>
<v Speaker 2>the market so effectively that you </v>

636
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:26.384
<v Speaker 2>cannot compete with them and so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>either have to think about regulating </v>

637
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:31.784
<v Speaker 2>them so that they're free and open to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody or I'm breaking up their </v>

638
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.160
<v Speaker 2>ability to control the market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

639
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:42.623
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the tough part for the </v>

640
00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Libertarian party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

641
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>

642
00:35:45.711 --> 00:35:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I do send some being pinned into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of answer.</v>

643
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:50.563
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we've been talking a bit about the </v>

644
00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.190
<v Speaker 1>tech component of this grand cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

645
00:35:55.191 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 1>That's going on you guys cool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

646
00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.043
<v Speaker 1>You're a small company or you're funded </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Patrion which were funded on Pedro </v>

647
00:36:02.691 --> 00:36:05.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have people that voluntarily pay you</v>

648
00:36:05.961 --> 00:36:08.330
<v Speaker 1>to support your content and make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

649
00:36:08.331 --> 00:36:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I know how validating and rewarding it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is and all that stuff,</v>

650
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.470
<v Speaker 1>but you find yourself often up against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big boys,</v>

651
00:36:15.471 --> 00:36:16.304
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like box funded to hundreds of millions </v>

652
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.300
<v Speaker 1>of dollars by different things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being critical of them here.</v>

653
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:21.723
<v Speaker 1>So it does get me to back to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I started with before about where </v>

654
00:36:23.991 --> 00:36:27.290
<v Speaker 1>does it come from for you to just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>brave.</v>

655
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to belittle that part of it</v>

656
00:36:29.871 --> 00:36:30.704
<v Speaker 1>that there's a new internet developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think is people that are doing </v>

657
00:36:34.311 --> 00:36:36.710
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not these well funded,</v>

658
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.640
<v Speaker 1>well oiled machines that we're watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>them crumble.</v>

659
00:36:40.641 --> 00:36:42.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sent me this morning,</v>

660
00:36:42.441 --> 00:36:43.274
<v Speaker 1>this thing about boxes ad rev is off by </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 percent or something and it's like </v>

661
00:36:46.851 --> 00:36:50.360
<v Speaker 1>we've got slim trim companies and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I really believe that's the future</v>

662
00:36:50.361 --> 00:36:54.920
<v Speaker 1>economically of this as well as in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of protecting the ideas.</v>

663
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

664
00:36:56.651 --> 00:36:57.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pretty.</v>

665
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.710
<v Speaker 2>We have a pretty amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

666
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:02.183
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started by myself and I ran the </v>

667
00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:04.854
<v Speaker 2>website for maybe a year or even a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half before I got my assistant </v>

668
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 2>editor onboard who's now sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>managing editor and he's extraordinarily</v>

669
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:18.180
<v Speaker 2>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely hardworking.</v>

670
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.080
<v Speaker 2>So I'm very indebted to him for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan,</v>

671
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Kay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

672
00:37:22.681 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 2>and my other editor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

673
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Palmer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's give credit where credit's due.</v>

674
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I contribute is also amazing,</v>

675
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate now as of 20,</v>

676
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 September,</v>

677
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:38.664
<v Speaker 2>we're getting up to 1 million unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>visitors a month with the staff of old </v>

678
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 2>part time staff of six or the six or </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven people.</v>

679
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 2>And we're getting almost a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniques a month.</v>

680
00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.453
<v Speaker 2>I am aware of magazines that have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>budget of millions of dollars that can </v>

681
00:37:59.421 --> 00:38:03.490
<v Speaker 2>not compete with our traffic and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have staffs of stop,</v>

682
00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.030
<v Speaker 2>like staffing capacity of 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

683
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:07.290
<v Speaker 2>50 people.</v>

684
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.130
<v Speaker 2>So we're extremely lane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're hardworking,</v>

685
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're nimble and innovative.</v>

686
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always thinking about innovations to</v>

687
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 2>the business model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can we do that's different?</v>

688
00:38:21.241 --> 00:38:22.074
<v Speaker 2>I think just following in the footsteps </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the old model is probably a recipe </v>

689
00:38:26.581 --> 00:38:30.840
<v Speaker 2>for failure and I truly believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertising is on the way out.</v>

690
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I know people can still make some money </v>
<v Speaker 2>through advertising,</v>

691
00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:34.644
<v Speaker 2>but I think out of it advertising gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>you a vulnerability because now you see </v>

692
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:41.014
<v Speaker 2>these activists trying to like target </v>
<v Speaker 2>brands if the brand is next to some </v>

693
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 2>content that activists don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think advertising is just,</v>

694
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it's bone this vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with it.</v>

695
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:55.903
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

696
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.990
<v Speaker 1>is it almost a fake vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

697
00:38:57.991 --> 00:38:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Because I always think when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.590
<v Speaker 1>they always try to boycott Hannity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

699
00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.150
<v Speaker 1>and it's like all of the people trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to boycott him,</v>

700
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.510
<v Speaker 1>putting aside whatever he said on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>given instance,</v>

701
00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.753
<v Speaker 1>they don't watch him in the first place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet the advertisers still feel that </v>

702
00:39:11.551 --> 00:39:12.384
<v Speaker 1>they have to bow to the mob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always find that to be a strange </v>

703
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:15.624
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's very few people who like </v>

704
00:39:17.101 --> 00:39:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Hannity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>

705
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.330
<v Speaker 1>who are so shocked by something he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want to boycott him.</v>

706
00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.300
<v Speaker 1>It's always people who hate him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place that don't watch.</v>

707
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.560
<v Speaker 1>So there's an odd piece of this that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like slightly disconnected from reality.</v>

708
00:39:28.561 --> 00:39:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

709
00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:29.683
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see corporations and companies in </v>

710
00:39:31.941 --> 00:39:32.774
<v Speaker 2>general are skittish and conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they want to protect their </v>

711
00:39:37.311 --> 00:39:38.144
<v Speaker 2>reputations and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid of any kind of </v>

712
00:39:42.021 --> 00:39:42.854
<v Speaker 2>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with you that these </v>

713
00:39:48.351 --> 00:39:52.700
<v Speaker 2>activists on social media who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>targeting companies,</v>

714
00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:55.730
<v Speaker 2>they're a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny minority of the population.</v>

715
00:39:55.731 --> 00:39:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't care or buy into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

716
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.170
<v Speaker 2>but corporations is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably some pr person who's like,</v>

717
00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want any controversy.</v>

718
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Let's detach ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

719
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:10.243
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of timidity and lack of </v>

720
00:40:16.131 --> 00:40:21.131
<v Speaker 2>strength and lack of spine is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that is part of that.</v>

721
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:28.020
<v Speaker 2>So we very much a conscious of if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever get mobbed and we do get mobbed,</v>

722
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.690
<v Speaker 2>sometimes we don't apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

723
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.063
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't give into the heckler's veto </v>

724
00:40:36.111 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

725
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.311
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

726
00:40:38.311 --> 00:40:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I really think it's important for um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

727
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.003
<v Speaker 2>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>company lead is anyone in a latest </v>

728
00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.973
<v Speaker 2>leadership position to grow a spine in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the era of social media and to not take </v>

729
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.830
<v Speaker 2>any of this outrage seriously.</v>

730
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

731
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Not Take it seriously or not take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

732
00:40:58.441 --> 00:40:59.274
<v Speaker 1>I think we've sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to take it seriously because it </v>

733
00:41:00.721 --> 00:41:01.554
<v Speaker 1>is sort of infecting a lot of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not take it as if it's </v>

734
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.620
<v Speaker 1>necessarily right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it's outrageous.</v>

735
00:41:07.621 --> 00:41:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Is that fair?</v>

736
00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

737
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.823
<v Speaker 2>you can say the recent example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an editor of the New York review of </v>

738
00:41:14.411 --> 00:41:19.411
<v Speaker 2>books in Borama was fired because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>published an article a by Canadian radio</v>

739
00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:27.580
<v Speaker 2>journalists who was credibly accused of </v>
<v Speaker 2>many cases of sexual assault.</v>

740
00:41:27.581 --> 00:41:29.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think the radio journalists was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

741
00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:35.740
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the editor was sacked for publishing</v>

742
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:41.300
<v Speaker 2>his article within the space of two days</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

743
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:42.134
<v Speaker 2>So there was a social media outrage </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon and it's all wrapped up with </v>

744
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:50.750
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's just fired just like that.</v>

745
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

746
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:55.720
<v Speaker 2>take some time out to consider it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

747
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 2>listen to the feedback from your readers</v>
<v Speaker 2>or from people on social media.</v>

748
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:00.314
<v Speaker 2>But when did we start making decisions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So suddenly these important decisions </v>

749
00:42:04.161 --> 00:42:04.994
<v Speaker 2>that affect people's livelihoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I find astonishing that </v>

750
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:10.184
<v Speaker 2>people in leadership positions just sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of throw all caution to the wind and </v>

751
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:14.991
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

752
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 2>we're going to sap someone because some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on twitter on happy.</v>

753
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the guilt by association part </v>

754
00:42:20.401 --> 00:42:20.941
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

755
00:42:20.941 --> 00:42:21.774
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible for a slim trim operation </v>

756
00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:25.140
<v Speaker 1>that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might find out in 10 years,</v>

757
00:42:25.141 --> 00:42:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you might find out that one of the guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working with now,</v>

758
00:42:27.451 --> 00:42:28.284
<v Speaker 1>three years ago did did something awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll use that to try to tar </v>

759
00:42:32.641 --> 00:42:33.474
<v Speaker 1>you and the danger of that or that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sat down with somebody and now we can </v>

760
00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:40.230
<v Speaker 1>put out a chart that links that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>did this person to that person.</v>

761
00:42:40.231 --> 00:42:41.064
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in an age of the Internet within </v>

762
00:42:42.361 --> 00:42:43.194
<v Speaker 1>six steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can link anybody to Kevin Bacon or </v>

763
00:42:44.761 --> 00:42:45.571
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

764
00:42:45.571 --> 00:42:46.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

765
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.610
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty ridiculous.</v>

766
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guilt by association is it for.</v>

767
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fallacy,</v>

768
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:55.244
<v Speaker 2>but it is powerful and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do find ourselves tainted and it's </v>

769
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:01.214
<v Speaker 2>tricky and I think we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every situation we have to judge on a </v>

770
00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:07.280
<v Speaker 2>case by case basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

771
00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you probably right,</v>

772
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:14.561
<v Speaker 2>it probably is going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I trust my readers and um,</v>

773
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they know who we are.</v>

774
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:18.763
<v Speaker 2>They know they're aware of our values </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can make the appropriate </v>

775
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 2>judgments at the time.</v>

776
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

777
00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:25.803
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though we've spent most of the </v>

778
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.140
<v Speaker 1>time here and most of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are writing,</v>

779
00:43:29.141 --> 00:43:29.974
<v Speaker 1>talking about what sort of going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern left and frustrations that </v>

780
00:43:32.621 --> 00:43:34.210
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that I have with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

781
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about the parts of their </v>

782
00:43:36.191 --> 00:43:37.024
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

783
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.873
<v Speaker 1>that you actually find a scary or </v>
<v Speaker 1>untoward or whatever you want to call </v>

784
00:43:41.861 --> 00:43:42.694
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the alt right is at </v>

785
00:43:45.371 --> 00:43:46.204
<v Speaker 1>this point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone says you give me the </v>

786
00:43:48.731 --> 00:43:49.810
<v Speaker 1>definition of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

787
00:43:49.811 --> 00:43:51.310
<v Speaker 1>what does that even mean to you at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>

788
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:52.611
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

789
00:43:52.611 --> 00:43:57.611
<v Speaker 2>I consider them to be the white </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalists that uh,</v>

790
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:03.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one in ethno state and they,</v>

791
00:44:03.961 --> 00:44:07.640
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty morally repugnant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty scary.</v>

792
00:44:07.641 --> 00:44:11.690
<v Speaker 2>And they engage in some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in quite vicious trolling.</v>

793
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.100
<v Speaker 2>They send death threats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the journalist.</v>

794
00:44:15.101 --> 00:44:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Cathy Young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

795
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:17.294
<v Speaker 2>was one of the first people to write an </v>
<v Speaker 2>article criticizing the bigotry of the </v>

796
00:44:21.921 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 2>alt right and she had a death threat </v>
<v Speaker 2>called into her home.</v>

797
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.370
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

798
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pretty scary.</v>

799
00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:31.770
<v Speaker 2>But I think there are a small group.</v>

800
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are we able to quantify that?</v>

801
00:44:34.451 --> 00:44:35.284
<v Speaker 1>Because that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think people are just very </v>

802
00:44:37.271 --> 00:44:38.104
<v Speaker 1>confused that they're making it seem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media makes it seem because they </v>

803
00:44:40.391 --> 00:44:44.500
<v Speaker 1>call everyone all right or far right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's this massive group.</v>

804
00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I can only talk about this in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Lens,</v>

805
00:44:46.991 --> 00:44:48.490
<v Speaker 1>but maybe maybe it's a little different </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

806
00:44:48.491 --> 00:44:53.050
<v Speaker 1>but that there's this massive group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>white nationalists who are coming for to</v>

807
00:44:53.051 --> 00:44:55.090
<v Speaker 1>turn America into some sort of ethno </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

808
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.193
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying there aren't racists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they are racist and of course </v>

809
00:44:58.811 --> 00:45:01.600
<v Speaker 1>there are bad people and people using </v>
<v Speaker 1>these tactics,</v>

810
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.740
<v Speaker 1>but I believe it's just a tiny sliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>

811
00:45:03.741 --> 00:45:04.574
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that you have old </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the meme makers and the shit </v>

812
00:45:06.821 --> 00:45:10.450
<v Speaker 1>posters and the rest of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not like what they do,</v>

813
00:45:10.451 --> 00:45:11.284
<v Speaker 1>but they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're having fun in their eyes and a </v>

814
00:45:13.451 --> 00:45:15.760
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways they're not just the evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

815
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I think a mistake was made back when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Milo was around and I think he.</v>

816
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.013
<v Speaker 2>He started using the term alt right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he might not have been aware of where </v>

817
00:45:30.611 --> 00:45:31.444
<v Speaker 2>that term originated and it actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>originated with the white nationalists </v>

818
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:36.930
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

819
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:37.903
<v Speaker 1>do you think Milo was using it more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that I just laid it out or just </v>

820
00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:45.140
<v Speaker 1>sort of these shit posting something </v>
<v Speaker 1>without acknowledging the other person.</v>

821
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was aware of where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the term originated or not,</v>

822
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:50.963
<v Speaker 2>but it was a huge era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an era for people who are adjusting to </v>

823
00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.613
<v Speaker 2>shit posting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a huge era era for them to use </v>

824
00:46:01.351 --> 00:46:04.720
<v Speaker 2>that label for themselves because unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

825
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.740
<v Speaker 2>what in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you are a white nationalist,</v>

826
00:46:07.741 --> 00:46:09.920
<v Speaker 2>you are not an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not an old writer.</v>

827
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

828
00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 2>the label I think came about in 2007 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

829
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Richard Spencer who </v>
<v Speaker 2>created the right journal or something.</v>

830
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:21.474
<v Speaker 2>So it was a big mistake for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>just want to have fun online and he </v>

831
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:28.070
<v Speaker 2>wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

832
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like push back against some of </v>

833
00:46:32.641 --> 00:46:33.474
<v Speaker 2>these pc orthodoxies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a huge mistake for them to use </v>

834
00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:36.564
<v Speaker 2>the term for themselves and that's given</v>
<v Speaker 2>license now for critics to apply the </v>

835
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:47.571
<v Speaker 2>term on everybody who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who pushes back against pc dogmas.</v>

836
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's really unfortunate,</v>

837
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.233
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to just say it over and over </v>

838
00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like these people are repugnant and we,</v>

839
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to have anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their ideology.</v>

840
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 2>The ideology is all ideologies </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian.</v>

841
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.020
<v Speaker 2>It's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

842
00:47:07.021 --> 00:47:08.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

843
00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:12.170
<v Speaker 2>and they engage in very scary vicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors.</v>

844
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So absolutely.</v>

845
00:47:14.191 --> 00:47:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I will coast side all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for the record,</v>

846
00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:17.874
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a repugnant ideology and these </v>

847
00:47:19.651 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 1>people are racist and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm less concerned about that because</v>

848
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:29.481
<v Speaker 1>I do believe it's a small sliver that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have real institutional power.</v>

849
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:30.423
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe it's going to gain some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's evidence that at </v>

850
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 1>least in eastern Europe that some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas,</v>

851
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.823
<v Speaker 1>partly as a pushback to the immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration problems that maybe it is </v>

852
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:40.730
<v Speaker 1>gaining some power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

853
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.010
<v Speaker 1>but are you concerned that it has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger institutional power?</v>

854
00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:45.844
<v Speaker 1>Because I think the stuff that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>often talking about is because we're </v>

855
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 1>worried about institutional power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>structural power,</v>

856
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.090
<v Speaker 1>not just that they were mean and bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there,</v>

857
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:57.810
<v Speaker 1>which yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are bad people out there and there</v>

858
00:47:57.811 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 1>will always be mean and bad people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

859
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because my background is so recently in </v>

860
00:48:04.741 --> 00:48:05.574
<v Speaker 2>academia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I focus a lot on universities and the </v>

861
00:48:07.741 --> 00:48:10.590
<v Speaker 2>ideologies that are popular within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

862
00:48:10.591 --> 00:48:15.591
<v Speaker 2>So that makes me focus on left wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology such as critical theory,</v>

863
00:48:17.041 --> 00:48:20.970
<v Speaker 2>poststructuralism and Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

864
00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.313
<v Speaker 2>if I was in a different context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might focus more on right wing </v>

865
00:48:26.281 --> 00:48:30.290
<v Speaker 2>ideologies and the effect that they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>on institutions and I'm sure.</v>

866
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.000
<v Speaker 1>So you're given a little nod to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern.</v>

867
00:48:32.001 --> 00:48:32.834
<v Speaker 1>Is there because you're showing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own bias is a little part of how </v>

868
00:48:35.581 --> 00:48:36.050
<v Speaker 1>you look at things?</v>

869
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

870
00:48:36.651 --> 00:48:37.640
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

871
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if I was closer to institutions</v>

872
00:48:42.861 --> 00:48:45.650
<v Speaker 2>that have more of a right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological influence,</v>

873
00:48:45.651 --> 00:48:49.580
<v Speaker 2>our would be criticizing that more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing those influences more.</v>

874
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.003
<v Speaker 2>I'm being Australian is a in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out out conservative or right wing </v>

875
00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.660
<v Speaker 2>ideologies are quite different to </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

876
00:49:05.661 --> 00:49:10.661
<v Speaker 2>So you probably already know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have universal healthcare,</v>

877
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:14.480
<v Speaker 2>we have gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a welfare state.</v>

878
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.530
<v Speaker 2>So if I lived in a country where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have those things,</v>

879
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I would probably be advocating for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

880
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:23.533
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this is context specific and </v>

881
00:49:26.421 --> 00:49:27.254
<v Speaker 2>you criticize what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a part of the reason why I criticize </v>

882
00:49:30.621 --> 00:49:31.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

883
00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:34.690
<v Speaker 2>what Jordan Peterson calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

884
00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.720
<v Speaker 2>postmodern near Marxism is because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced it,</v>

885
00:49:38.721 --> 00:49:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I see it all the time in Aca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in academia,</v>

886
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:43.280
<v Speaker 2>academic settings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

887
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:46.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry about the impact that,</v>

888
00:49:46.251 --> 00:49:50.420
<v Speaker 2>that ideology is having on media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law,</v>

889
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:53.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just the broader culture.</v>

890
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you hopeful that some of the good </v>

891
00:49:57.361 --> 00:50:00.600
<v Speaker 1>ideas that we've talked about here are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to win out?</v>

892
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That that seems to be one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions I get at public events now.</v>

893
00:50:03.991 --> 00:50:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I think there is a sense that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>woken up a certain amount of people,</v>

894
00:50:08.371 --> 00:50:09.204
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Peterson towards selling out every </v>

895
00:50:10.651 --> 00:50:11.484
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands of people </v>

896
00:50:12.451 --> 00:50:14.880
<v Speaker 1>literally all over the world will be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>February,</v>

897
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Australia in February.</v>

898
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:20.483
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's still a concern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much worse before it gets </v>

899
00:50:24.451 --> 00:50:24.960
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

900
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a question people,</v>

901
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 2>me as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I the.</v>

902
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't have an oracle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see the future.</v>

903
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:38.111
<v Speaker 2>And all I can say is that I'm doing my </v>
<v Speaker 2>very best to counter these bad ideas and</v>

904
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:42.650
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually anybody who's concerned.</v>

905
00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:43.484
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have some responsibility and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody should think about </v>

906
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:51.020
<v Speaker 2>sharing the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

907
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:51.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

908
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Charlie truly</v>

909
00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:54.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

910
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.983
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Charlie Hebdo happened and the </v>

911
00:50:58.271 --> 00:51:02.560
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media in Europe and the UK </v>
<v Speaker 2>and America,</v>

912
00:51:02.561 --> 00:51:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I think didn't want to publish that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoon of Muhammad,</v>

913
00:51:06.011 --> 00:51:10.930
<v Speaker 2>which got those men and women killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douglas Murray came out and said,</v>

914
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.370
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Share the risk.</v>

915
00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.930
<v Speaker 1>That's when I came aware of one of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>best moments is incredible.</v>

916
00:51:16.931 --> 00:51:17.490
<v Speaker 1>It's on youtube.</v>

917
00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>

918
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that impacted me a lot as </v>

919
00:51:22.161 --> 00:51:24.700
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

920
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:28.640
<v Speaker 2>anyone who's concerned about the way our</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

921
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:33.770
<v Speaker 2>broader western culture is headed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to think deeply about how they can</v>

922
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:38.120
<v Speaker 2>make a little bit of difference by </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharing the risk.</v>

923
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.013
<v Speaker 2>Just speaking honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in conversations with friends speaking </v>

924
00:51:42.081 --> 00:51:47.081
<v Speaker 2>honestly and openly in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normalizing conversations and um,</v>

925
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:49.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

926
00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.050
<v Speaker 2>just taking on a little bit of risk,</v>

927
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.630
<v Speaker 1>what does that tell you about the slide </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has occurred in the West?</v>

928
00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:55.493
<v Speaker 1>Is this just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it an infection of success or </v>

929
00:52:00.811 --> 00:52:01.644
<v Speaker 1>something that we could be so successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>that even taking a little risk seems </v>

930
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.320
<v Speaker 1>awful to people.</v>

931
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.570
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

932
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:13.280
<v Speaker 2>he runs a very conformist and most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people a cow.</v>

933
00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:15.440
<v Speaker 2>It's unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

934
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:20.370
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these bad ideas that are being promoted.</v>

935
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I only promoted by a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny minority of people,</v>

936
00:52:24.001 --> 00:52:27.810
<v Speaker 2>but they're very noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loud and aggressive.</v>

937
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:29.723
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is simply the silent </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority not being feeling too </v>

938
00:52:36.421 --> 00:52:41.421
<v Speaker 2>intimidated to sort of push back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we can encourage those who are in</v>

939
00:52:42.331 --> 00:52:44.730
<v Speaker 2>the silent majority to push back against</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

940
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.150
<v Speaker 2>logs on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both the hard right and the hard left.</v>

941
00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

942
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:53.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a much healthier civil society,</v>

943
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:57.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's about empowering the moderates </v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak freely,</v>

944
00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:59.350
<v Speaker 2>speak openly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

945
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:04.110
<v Speaker 2>and not feel afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ashamed of the moderate views.</v>

946
00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:05.043
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've also turned the words like </v>

947
00:53:06.611 --> 00:53:09.580
<v Speaker 1>civility and moderation or thought of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

948
00:53:09.581 --> 00:53:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Now you're a fence sitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to murder half the people</v>

949
00:53:14.021 --> 00:53:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not ost from avengers,</v>

950
00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:16.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

951
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those people,</v>

952
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.410
<v Speaker 2>that people who are gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that civility is,</v>

953
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 2>is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

954
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.200
<v Speaker 1>we see a lot of this now by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that civility is a bad thing.</v>

955
00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 1>A lot of pieces about.</v>

956
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that some unrepresentative</v>

957
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:35.663
<v Speaker 2>of the broader population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that media and certain parts of </v>

958
00:53:40.501 --> 00:53:41.334
<v Speaker 2>media and universities have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>captured by cultists in a way and they </v>

959
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:46.944
<v Speaker 2>have these crazy ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would be careful about </v>

960
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:50.964
<v Speaker 2>generalizing those ideas to the broader </v>
<v Speaker 2>population because I think most normal </v>

961
00:53:55.081 --> 00:53:57.180
<v Speaker 2>people are pretty chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

962
00:53:57.181 --> 00:53:58.014
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been not enough time in your </v>

963
00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 2>country to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know.</v>

964
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:00.911
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

965
00:54:00.911 --> 00:54:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I think you are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

966
00:54:02.211 --> 00:54:03.044
<v Speaker 1>I'm out there going across the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing that there are so many just </v>

967
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.213
<v Speaker 1>decent people that hysterics and the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I said earlier about how social </v>

968
00:54:11.451 --> 00:54:13.680
<v Speaker 1>media has leaked into reality or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

969
00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:14.773
<v Speaker 1>It's making everyone feel crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm meeting these incredible people </v>

970
00:54:17.781 --> 00:54:18.614
<v Speaker 1>all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to live and let live and </v>

971
00:54:21.561 --> 00:54:22.394
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I don't know your feelings on </v>

972
00:54:23.781 --> 00:54:25.220
<v Speaker 1>abortion for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we agree.</v>

973
00:54:25.221 --> 00:54:26.054
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems that actually seems </v>

974
00:54:28.161 --> 00:54:30.380
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

975
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.393
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of says something we touched </v>

976
00:54:32.931 --> 00:54:35.450
<v Speaker 1>on briefly right before we started that </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

977
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I was saying how I'm not that interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in politics per se at the moment,</v>

978
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:41.023
<v Speaker 1>even though this is all framed within a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political lens that I'm much more </v>

979
00:54:44.091 --> 00:54:44.924
<v Speaker 1>interested in culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you feel about this and was </v>

980
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:51.350
<v Speaker 1>that always how you felt about this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has something shifted?</v>

981
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.613
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been particularly interested </v>

982
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.493
<v Speaker 2>in partisan politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that politics is downstream </v>

983
00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:00.474
<v Speaker 2>of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ideas that are popular within a </v>

984
00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:06.420
<v Speaker 2>culture then get reflected in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

985
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.313
<v Speaker 2>So if you want politics to be a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and to be a bit healthier and less </v>

986
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:13.794
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to impact the culture first </v>

987
00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 2>because culture is bigger than politics.</v>

988
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a danger that we're just in </v>

989
00:55:22.071 --> 00:55:25.730
<v Speaker 1>this like locked culture war now so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>our politics can never get better?</v>

990
00:55:25.731 --> 00:55:26.564
<v Speaker 1>Like we sort of have this affair </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian leftism and now we've got </v>

991
00:55:29.691 --> 00:55:30.650
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

992
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.660
<v Speaker 1>these are the cultural fights that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>having now.</v>

993
00:55:32.661 --> 00:55:34.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of us in this spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

994
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:35.583
<v Speaker 1>But like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all politics is going to come from </v>

995
00:55:37.461 --> 00:55:38.294
<v Speaker 1>those two things at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The politics sort of is almost </v>

996
00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.400
<v Speaker 1>irreparably damaged.</v>

997
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

998
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the future holds for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

999
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.133
<v Speaker 2>From an outsider looking in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does look quite scary that the level </v>

1000
00:55:54.271 --> 00:55:58.020
<v Speaker 2>of tribalism that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems a parent.</v>

1001
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Just the amount of hate and distrust </v>
<v Speaker 2>that each side has for the other.</v>

1002
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>It's quite scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1003
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:11.520
<v Speaker 2>I just hope that if the worst happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

1004
00:56:11.521 --> 00:56:12.354
<v Speaker 2>we will always have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will have outposts where western </v>

1005
00:56:16.651 --> 00:56:20.550
<v Speaker 2>civilization survives and thrives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand,</v>

1006
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:21.443
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

1007
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Basically going back to what I said at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning,</v>

1008
00:56:24.521 --> 00:56:27.630
<v Speaker 1>it's good to be surrounded by water will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1009
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 1>we will be an outpost and will kill the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra moving your house.</v>

1010
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:35.310
<v Speaker 1>We're going to keep you that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of feet work.</v>

1011
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are going to New Zealand</v>

1012
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 2>and buying houses there in case the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst happens.</v>

1013
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to end on this terrible.</v>

1014
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to bring this back,</v>

1015
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's concern about that.</v>

1016
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right,</v>

1017
00:56:48.411 --> 00:56:49.244
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go down that rabbit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could look at all of these ideas </v>

1018
00:56:52.191 --> 00:56:53.024
<v Speaker 1>that I truly think are the ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could unravel western society and free </v>

1019
00:56:56.631 --> 00:56:59.150
<v Speaker 1>thought and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I talk about them so much,</v>

1020
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.320
<v Speaker 1>but there is a counter and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to keep doing,</v>

1021
00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:03.210
<v Speaker 1>so bring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it,</v>

1022
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:04.063
<v Speaker 1>bring it home on a positive note please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before people start buying real estate </v>

1023
00:57:06.261 --> 00:57:09.750
<v Speaker 1>in New Zealand or you were just trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help them market in Australia there.</v>

1024
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.293
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need any help in the housing </v>

1025
00:57:12.051 --> 00:57:12.930
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>

1026
00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:13.903
<v Speaker 2>I'm optimistic because I see the amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive reception that I get </v>

1027
00:57:19.371 --> 00:57:23.480
<v Speaker 2>through quizlet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our audience grows every month.</v>

1028
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm more and more people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to our website,</v>

1029
00:57:28.701 --> 00:57:31.790
<v Speaker 2>feeling brave enough to write their </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts down and send it through,</v>

1030
00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:37.060
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is every individual has </v>
<v Speaker 2>the power to change the world of ideas.</v>

1031
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:42.890
<v Speaker 2>If you've got an idea and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate it and write it down and send</v>

1032
00:57:42.891 --> 00:57:47.180
<v Speaker 2>it in or articulated it in in some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>fashion,</v>

1033
00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you do have the power to transform and </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact this,</v>

1034
00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:56.330
<v Speaker 2>this culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to make a huge difference.</v>

1035
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:58.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>

1036
00:57:58.761 --> 00:58:01.040
<v Speaker 2>And that makes me feel happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimistic.</v>

1037
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.980
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is how we can add.</v>

1038
00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.790
<v Speaker 1>We can end it on the seasteading.</v>
