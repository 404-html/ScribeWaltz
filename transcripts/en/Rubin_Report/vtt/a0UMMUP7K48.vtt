00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is the host of Tucker </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlson,</v>

2
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>tonight on Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now a New York Times best selling author</v>

3
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>with his new book ship of fools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tucker Carlson.</v>

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am glad to have you here,</v>

5
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to be here.</v>

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:19.224
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that anyone that has ever </v>

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:21.624
<v Speaker 1>walked in here and been more impressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the rubrics and television so I know </v>

8
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>what this is and it's just the coolest </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing I've seen in a long time.</v>

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Are you jealous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you joking?</v>

10
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm jealous.</v>

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>You have millions and millions of views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a massive staff,</v>

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the control that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

13
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>which is wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.741
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

15
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>so speaking of control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have only one goal for the next hour,</v>

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>which is to some point say something so </v>
<v Speaker 1>ludicrous that you stare at me with that</v>

17
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:53.751
<v Speaker 1>face where I make do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did the face come?</v>

18
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>It's totally everyone the memes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>come in with that,</v>

19
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>but the funny thing is when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just my face at rest,</v>

20
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:00.894
<v Speaker 1>which is golden retriever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a mouth breather and when I </v>

21
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>first started this show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I got complaints about it internally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea was,</v>

23
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>it's too embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click a moron,</v>

24
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>but I can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't help myself.</v>

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not as super self aware person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a mirror user for example,</v>

26
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>because if you work in TV and you become</v>
<v Speaker 1>really self conscious,</v>

27
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:22.224
<v Speaker 1>it destroys you and makes you insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just am trained after 20 years not </v>

28
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:26.694
<v Speaker 1>to think about the way I look and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know that I look like a </v>

29
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>moron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do and I'm not changing.</v>

30
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.033
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not guessing because even </v>

31
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>just now when you were in the green room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my girl is putting makeup on your,</v>

32
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sat there for literally two seconds.</v>

33
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do anything.</v>

34
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:42.564
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even look at the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at me and you can go </v>

35
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know in TV,</v>

36
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>if you start to think about how other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people perceive you,</v>

37
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>you just drowned in lake me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

39
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>So I'm glad to have you here for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of reasons.</v>

40
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:56.544
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get into the book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're kind of simpatico on </v>

41
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>what I think are the big issues of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day to free speech,</v>

42
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I will be totally honest with you,</v>

43
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>years ago when I first saw you on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossfire on CNN,</v>

44
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I was not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I was alone in that I thought here's</v>

45
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>this bow tie wearing guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly kind of smug and whatever.</v>

46
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>And I was a lefty at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

47
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>so we were really polar opposites </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

48
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but everything has shifted enough that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are kind of allies now.</v>

49
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think that's Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before we do anything else,</v>

50
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>tell me about little Tucker Carlson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People know about Tucker Carlson,</v>

51
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>that eviscerates socialists all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that like as a kid?</v>

52
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern California.</v>

53
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.693
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in studio city and I mean I </v>

54
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.564
<v Speaker 1>think I've always been the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-authoritarian for the individual </v>

55
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>against the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate bullies,</v>

57
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I hate being bullied more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if I find myself,</v>

58
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:57.564
<v Speaker 1>and I've always been this way in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario where everyone is forced to </v>

59
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in bovine agreement about something,</v>

60
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>my instinct is always to be the one guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was like,</v>

61
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm so,</v>

62
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:08.044
<v Speaker 1>I haven't changed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The particulars of my political beliefs </v>

63
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>have changed because America has changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>so dramatically.</v>

64
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.013
<v Speaker 1>I'm 49,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the last 40 years it's become a </v>

65
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>different country and a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I thought would work haven't</v>

66
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>

67
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.883
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the things I thought were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening turned out to be </v>

68
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

69
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my views have changed,</v>

70
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.120
<v Speaker 1>but my instincts have remained </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent over time.</v>

71
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Were you always political or were your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents?</v>

72
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I was always political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Well I was always interested in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my father was a non conformist,</v>

74
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's an understatement.</v>

75
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.283
<v Speaker 1>And his baseline position was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody says it doesn't mean </v>

76
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it's true in the answers to the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.353
<v Speaker 1>people are found in history because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one immutable fact of history as human </v>

78
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:56.164
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it literally does not change and </v>

79
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:58.624
<v Speaker 1>you see consistent themes over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to understand what's </v>

80
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look backward and you will,</v>

81
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean just pretty conventional stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it sounds kind of radical,</v>

82
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>but I'm basically at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My main influence was my dad.</v>

83
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with my dad and my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

84
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>his view was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>just because all the Chin tuggers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it does not prove it.</v>

86
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Does that seem like a pretty obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>through line to your success right now?</v>

87
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:27.061
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like every day there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other group think exactly.</v>

88
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Lunacy that it's like these people then </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on your show.</v>

89
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>And I always think it's hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>

90
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:36.991
<v Speaker 1>do they know what they're getting into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be a and will,</v>

91
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>but they don't actually have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals for the debate that I do.</v>

92
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.753
<v Speaker 1>So I'm linear and literal and old </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashioned and I go into it believing </v>

93
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:51.631
<v Speaker 1>that I can win the person over with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior reasoning or you know,</v>

94
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.943
<v Speaker 1>a larger and more compelling facts set </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever they're coming to this </v>

95
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>believing they've already won because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have superior virtue.</v>

96
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So they're having a theological </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

97
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a political debate and too </v>
<v Speaker 1>often we talk past each other.</v>

98
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theological conversation.</v>

99
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>A couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of people have mentioned on the</v>

100
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:10.730
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Peter,</v>

101
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>because he and a philosophy professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been on a few times.</v>

102
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>He calls this sort of new leftism a </v>
<v Speaker 1>secular religion.</v>

103
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you view that?</v>

104
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an Episcopalian,</v>

105
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:19.894
<v Speaker 1>so I know what happened because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>episcopal church was the church or the </v>

106
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.563
<v Speaker 1>American ruling class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our national cathedrals and Episcopal </v>

107
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:27.004
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our culture was rooted in mainline </v>

108
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>protestantism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was a Protestant country and</v>

109
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.223
<v Speaker 1>our rulers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they were like literally </v>

110
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:37.414
<v Speaker 1>Protestant or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internalized the values of that faith </v>

111
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and then within like a 20 year period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faith evaporated.</v>

112
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>The Episcopal church barely exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

113
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>and certainly as a national force it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant,</v>

114
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't eliminate the religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse within people,</v>

115
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:53.000
<v Speaker 1>which is inherent.</v>

116
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>It's innate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're born that way.</v>

117
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>We worship something in the end whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it doesn't need to be God,</v>

118
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.623
<v Speaker 1>and so they've transferred that </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious impulse to the political </v>

119
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:03.914
<v Speaker 1>sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making the same arguments that </v>

120
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>19th century Protestants made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the calvinists like,</v>

121
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I am safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know this.</v>

122
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>That's my baseline assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of God's elect.</v>

123
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.013
<v Speaker 1>You were not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go into any conversation like </v>

124
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.764
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing will be resolved because it's </v>

125
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.490
<v Speaker 1>already been decided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Verse Evil.</v>

127
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it is.</v>

128
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it always like this?</v>

129
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.320
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like wha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

130
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 1>what Gimme Gimme some markers of when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw things kind of start to change.</v>

131
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of,</v>

132
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an intellectual and a talk show </v>

133
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.464
<v Speaker 1>host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm a little that we have our promo </v>

134
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.850
<v Speaker 1>clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

136
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do.</v>

137
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.303
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it took me a while to see the </v>

138
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.311
<v Speaker 1>outline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

139
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:50.144
<v Speaker 1>this all comes kind of slowly to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm caught in an earlier time </v>

140
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:54.224
<v Speaker 1>just by virtue of my age and so I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have these conversations that were </v>

141
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.871
<v Speaker 1>confusing to me where you'd be debating </v>
<v Speaker 1>a so called liberal and I would be and I</v>

142
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>would find myself taking the liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

143
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.723
<v Speaker 1>like in favor of free speech or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might default suspicion of corporate </v>

144
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:09.704
<v Speaker 1>power or concentrations of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere because it's a threat to the </v>

145
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>individual or in favor of due process or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:16.894
<v Speaker 1>I would take a position that I heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals have of my childhood take and </v>

147
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>the liberal I'm debating will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

148
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>And if Google says that it's true or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

149
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:25.934
<v Speaker 1>if you're accused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove yourself innocent or if what you </v>

150
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:28.394
<v Speaker 1>say is offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have right to say it and be </v>

151
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

152
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>This is a mirror image of what I grew up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

153
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>So actually to answer your question as </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly as I can,</v>

154
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they ever really meant </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they said.</v>

155
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.753
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that the pursuit of power </v>

156
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.813
<v Speaker 1>and the empowerment of the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party was always the goal and that was </v>

157
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>just the disguise they used in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve it.</v>

158
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>In 1979,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer.</v>

159
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we'd be in a healthier </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation if there was a same democratic</v>

160
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 1>party even if all the policies were </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and believes?</v>

161
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the point in my book.</v>

162
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>The funkshway is off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for 100 years you had one party which</v>

163
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>was the corporate party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party,</v>

164
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.283
<v Speaker 1>the country club party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the party of the ruling class and the </v>

165
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:09.810
<v Speaker 1>other party existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ineffective.</v>

166
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Keep it in check and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

167
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 1>you know you're getting rich because all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are working really hard.</v>

168
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>You need to think about their interests </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of different things happen.</v>

169
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.423
<v Speaker 1>The value of labor dropped because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology to the point where it's not </v>

170
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>even worth representing the working </v>
<v Speaker 1>class because they're not worth anything</v>

171
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>actually that this was the calculation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Democratic Party.</v>

172
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.333
<v Speaker 1>And so basically what you have is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird alignment where the leadership of </v>

173
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:35.894
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate interests and leadership of </v>

174
00:08:37.621 --> 00:08:38.454
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Party represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate interests and there's no one </v>

175
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 1>to represent the middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that again,</v>

176
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.563
<v Speaker 1>the balance is off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a vigorous party standing up </v>

177
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well wait a second.</v>

178
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 1>You need balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

179
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.810
<v Speaker 1>You need balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

180
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>So is that the part of this that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary for our future.</v>

181
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:55.724
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of what you're going for</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the book is that if one side </v>

182
00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:58.914
<v Speaker 1>completely implodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it seems more likely as we're </v>

183
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.180
<v Speaker 1>taping this at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Democrats are.</v>

184
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely implode.</v>

185
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.213
<v Speaker 1>That it's not as if all the conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies that you might like would </v>

186
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>suddenly take root.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that we would actually tilt in some</v>

187
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

188
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.363
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is why marriage is an </v>

189
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:22.371
<v Speaker 1>institution works because there's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>another person pushing back against your</v>

190
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>bad instincts are balancing you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

191
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>and what's true at home is probably true</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a national scale,</v>

192
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 1>on a political scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

193
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely need a vigorous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>principled opposition party always,</v>

194
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 1>or else you've got something really </v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly.</v>

195
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got the monitor party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what we have.</v>

196
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.073
<v Speaker 1>You know Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I know you admire also one of the </v>

197
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:44.814
<v Speaker 1>lines when he's talking about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting you brought up </v>

198
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

199
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:48.260
<v Speaker 1>He say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fight with your spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to beat them because then</v>

201
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you're married to a loser.</v>

202
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.293
<v Speaker 1>You want to give them a chance to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out something so that you'll be able to </v>

203
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 1>move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we seem at this,</v>

204
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.663
<v Speaker 1>we're at this odd place right now where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one side is trying to be the </v>

205
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:04.824
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side of trying to beat the </v>

206
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>other side and the rest of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is actually most of us are</v>

207
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

208
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to beat your spouse </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're married to a loser,</v>

209
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>but you're also a loser if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>married to a loser.</v>

210
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:16.404
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're implicated in the future of the </v>

211
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>other side because in the end you're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this together.</v>

212
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're coming from it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>different perspectives,</v>

213
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all Americans,</v>

214
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 1>so in the same way that crushing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>spouse doesn't actually win you any kind</v>

215
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 1>of meaningful victory or victory you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>want crushing your fellow Americans,</v>

216
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.560
<v Speaker 1>doesn't improve your life or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

217
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:42.414
<v Speaker 1>you don't want any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to lead to something really </v>

219
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>bad action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really ugly.</v>

220
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And everybody who's paying any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention senses it on an animal level.</v>

221
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is moving in a,</v>

222
00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:52.974
<v Speaker 1>in a really ominous direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know we could talk about why we're </v>

223
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 1>frustrated with the Democrats all along </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>

224
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put that aside because I feel like</v>

225
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a little bit of low hanging fruit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we both do it.</v>

226
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>We do it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

227
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>let's talk more about the Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

228
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.860
<v Speaker 1>So tell me some of your frustrations </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Republican Party.</v>

229
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Democratic Party was for,</v>

230
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add probably close to 100 years,</v>

231
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 1>the party of wage earners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometime in the last,</v>

232
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I would say 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably at the end of the Clinton,</v>

233
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.513
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of apex of the tech boom in the </v>

234
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 1>late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.783
<v Speaker 1>the Clinton administration decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reorient the party away from its </v>

236
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:29.844
<v Speaker 1>traditional base to it's new base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the rich and the poor and the </v>

237
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Republican party being dumb didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

238
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.163
<v Speaker 1>And it was only the emergence of trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>that forced them to sort of realize </v>

239
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

240
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't represent the people we thought</v>

241
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:47.130
<v Speaker 1>we represented actually the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the country club party.</v>

242
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 1>They denied it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hated that.</v>

243
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.520
<v Speaker 1>That line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was true.</v>

244
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the things that are true that we,</v>

245
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.593
<v Speaker 1>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we now need to become the </v>

246
00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.291
<v Speaker 1>middleclass party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

247
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 1>they just didn't want to become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middleclass party actually at all.</v>

248
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 1>And it took trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

249
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.263
<v Speaker 1>trump is a flawed person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Complex will not a complex person but a </v>

250
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>flawed person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to that,</v>

251
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but he basically has forced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican party to be what it in effect</v>

252
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>already is the party of last resort for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people making,</v>

253
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 to $150,000</v>

254
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:23.111
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:23.944
<v Speaker 1>the people who are making enough not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be on welfare but not enough to send </v>

256
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:27.670
<v Speaker 1>their kids to summer camp.</v>

257
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.103
<v Speaker 1>That is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the core of the country </v>

258
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want to represent those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and to.</v>

259
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not one of those people,</v>

260
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to give you the view from </v>
<v Speaker 1>coal country at all.</v>

261
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in La Jolla and Georgetown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

262
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.950
<v Speaker 1>but I know less about what the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class things.</v>

263
00:12:43.951 --> 00:12:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot about what the ruling class</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

264
00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:46.324
<v Speaker 1>Having lived in it my whole life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate the leadership of the </v>

265
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.213
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hates the American middle class and has </v>

266
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:55.090
<v Speaker 1>contempt for them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>infuriating.</v>

267
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 1>What does it say though that trump who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one of them?</v>

268
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To care about them.</v>

269
00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>You who's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them seems to care them.</v>

270
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Me grew up in new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only lived in New York and La.</v>

271
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

272
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

273
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.133
<v Speaker 1>Why has there been such a shift that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that almost seems impossible to that </v>

274
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:13.354
<v Speaker 1>trump would be the hero of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's exactly the last time we had </v>

275
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

276
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Of course it was in the progressive era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teddy Roosevelt,</v>

277
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:21.940
<v Speaker 1>really the pivotal president of post </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war America.</v>

278
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:26.941
<v Speaker 1>I would argue who made this a capitalist</v>
<v Speaker 1>country by restraining capitalism the,</v>

279
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Romanovs didn't do that and they got</v>

280
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:31.380
<v Speaker 1>70 years bolshevism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

281
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.450
<v Speaker 1>But Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really was a genius,</v>

282
00:13:33.451 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

283
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.400
<v Speaker 1>The concentration is corporate power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So scary.</v>

284
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.383
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna overwhelm the democracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to have a counter </v>

285
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 1>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 1>in the wobblies are going to take power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Roosevelt was the last person to fill</v>

287
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>this role and he was exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar to trump.</v>

288
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't throwing chairs through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>window into the country club.</v>

289
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:54.184
<v Speaker 1>He was throwing them out onto the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was from the class that he was </v>

290
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:02.320
<v Speaker 1>trying to restrain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you sort of have to be like,</v>

291
00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:04.510
<v Speaker 1>he knew what they were like because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of them.</v>

292
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>

293
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.390
<v Speaker 1>but I would just say my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

294
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:08.224
<v Speaker 1>it always goes back to I have greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathy for the lone guy who's getting </v>

295
00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>pushed around that I do for the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pushing them around.</v>

296
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:18.610
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like right now the least </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular group in America,</v>

297
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in the middle west and they have </v>

298
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 1>kind of antiquated social attitudes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have very little economic power and</v>

299
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 1>they're overweight and everyone hates </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

300
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like really because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans actually like,</v>

301
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this,</v>

302
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing this to black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people or Hispanics or any group.</v>

303
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I would be sympathetic because I hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

304
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.103
<v Speaker 1>And I'm actually not even sure that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to some of the social stuff </v>

305
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:42.870
<v Speaker 1>that their abuser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That and I agree,</v>

306
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I think they've changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

307
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can see this from you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

308
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you would know you.</v>

309
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.380
<v Speaker 1>People don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to live however you are.</v>

310
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.223
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to come on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>property and take their stuff and you </v>

311
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:57.740
<v Speaker 1>can't punch them walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal gay guy from New York.</v>

312
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.300
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love,</v>

313
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

314
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the mind,</v>

315
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 1>in the kind of Cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled mind of your average Brooklyn</v>

316
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.950
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>

317
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval,</v>

318
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.213
<v Speaker 1>but they're not actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're basically libertarian and </v>

319
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always have been.</v>

320
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is trump then as you've </v>

321
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.830
<v Speaker 1>interviewed the guy a bunch of times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

322
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:23.243
<v Speaker 1>What actually in the scheme of what your</v>
<v Speaker 1>book is about and sort of where America </v>

323
00:15:26.881 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 1>is at at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he just the great record that we sort</v>

324
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:31.214
<v Speaker 1>of needed so that this ship of fools </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't gonna sink and take everybody a </v>

325
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:35.763
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

326
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.643
<v Speaker 1>here's what trump is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is not the guy who comes to </v>

327
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Washington and transforms the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's not capable of that.</v>

328
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.340
<v Speaker 1>He's not interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington is a very specific town.</v>

329
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:47.174
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the legislative process is </v>

330
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.390
<v Speaker 1>highly complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't understand.</v>

331
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:53.210
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seek to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to be the guy who runs on</v>

332
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:55.250
<v Speaker 1>these nine policies and then affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>them once,</v>

333
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>select it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets them to the congress,</v>

334
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:58.710
<v Speaker 1>gets them to the agencies he can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

335
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that's not his role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very frustrating actually.</v>

336
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 1>If you're from DC like me to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

337
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:03.344
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what a second get the Energy </v>

338
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.233
<v Speaker 1>Department under control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to happen is $3 million </v>

339
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 1>executive branch employees versus trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's role.</v>

340
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that right there.</v>

341
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 1>There's $3,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

342
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:14.894
<v Speaker 1>Three dollars million executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are 3 million executive </v>

343
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:17.564
<v Speaker 1>branch employee that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may include the military by the </v>

344
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:22.040
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was not quite right,</v>

345
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:22.874
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying like the permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>class in DC and I live right in the </v>

346
00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:27.470
<v Speaker 1>center of them.</v>

347
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate trump.</v>

348
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 1>He's a threat to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why do they hate him?</v>

349
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 1>They hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because he's a right winger.</v>

350
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:33.910
<v Speaker 1>He's hardly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're actually here.</v>

351
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 1>They hate him because he's the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>says the obvious things.</v>

352
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.853
<v Speaker 1>So like when we went to Helsinki last </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer and interviewed him during the </v>

353
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:44.864
<v Speaker 1>Putin thing and like the crystallized </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me in this conversation I had with </v>

354
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:48.680
<v Speaker 1>him off camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

355
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I said something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking about NATO.</v>

356
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.640
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we have NATO?</v>

357
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.610
<v Speaker 1>And as someone who's looked like a Cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>War Kid,</v>

358
00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:56.001
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

359
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I like NATO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking to myself.</v>

360
00:16:57.591 --> 00:16:58.071
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:16:58.071 --> 00:16:59.940
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.123
<v Speaker 1>fell in 1991.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the point of Vedo keep them </v>

363
00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:05.090
<v Speaker 1>from invading western Europe but they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't exist anymore.</v>

364
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we still have them?</v>

365
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.740
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to searching for a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer and I couldn't find one.</v>

366
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>So trump repeats this and public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's like,</v>

367
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

368
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you working for?</v>

369
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Potent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought this is what trump does.</v>

370
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 1>He comes in and his kind of artistic way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ask the obvious question at the core</v>

371
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.940
<v Speaker 1>of whatever the issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the one question everyone's been</v>

372
00:17:25.941 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 1>avoiding because they don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to it.</v>

373
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why do,</v>

374
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 1>why are we signing a trade agreement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting the other signatories ignore the</v>

375
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 1>terms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we have a border?</v>

376
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are not complex questions are very</v>

377
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:38.714
<v Speaker 1>obvious questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they are an answered an </v>

378
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:42.614
<v Speaker 1>unanswerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases they exposed shorter the </v>

379
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:46.034
<v Speaker 1>mediocrity of a ruling class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they actually don't know what </v>

380
00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:50.410
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

381
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.150
<v Speaker 2>So I have a lot of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you know,</v>

382
00:17:52.151 --> 00:17:52.984
<v Speaker 2>some of them who think that this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're talking about with trump is </v>

383
00:17:56.081 --> 00:18:00.790
<v Speaker 2>this sort of existential threat to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that this erratic minus this idea</v>

384
00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:01.624
<v Speaker 2>of you just throw the idea out there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then let it sort of ruminate and see </v>

385
00:18:04.781 --> 00:18:05.614
<v Speaker 2>what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is just too dangerous to play </v>

386
00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:09.900
<v Speaker 2>ball with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect you disagree.</v>

387
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:10.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

388
00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:11.474
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean populism is a threat to </v>

389
00:18:13.701 --> 00:18:14.534
<v Speaker 1>everything that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a populist at all and I think </v>

390
00:18:18.921 --> 00:18:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think populism arises as a symptom</v>

391
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:25.190
<v Speaker 1>of discontent that you need to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a democracy.</v>

392
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:26.840
<v Speaker 1>If you want to continue the democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

393
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.943
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to live in a country this </v>

394
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.120
<v Speaker 1>volatile anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does,</v>

395
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.800
<v Speaker 1>but I think in order to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

396
00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you have to name them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

397
00:18:35.871 --> 00:18:36.704
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one of these guys it like I </v>

398
00:18:37.821 --> 00:18:40.280
<v Speaker 1>believe in creative destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to destroy things,</v>

399
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.230
<v Speaker 1>very hard to build them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:45.260
<v Speaker 1>it's incremental effort over time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>builds things.</v>

401
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

402
00:18:46.371 --> 00:18:49.040
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the complaint 100 percent,</v>

403
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.890
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it's a two way deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

404
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.050
<v Speaker 1>So if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dave,</v>

405
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

406
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.860
<v Speaker 1>did you pay for this house?</v>

407
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.323
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one thing I don't want to </v>

408
00:18:59.751 --> 00:19:02.240
<v Speaker 1>talk about because actually you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just squatting here.</v>

409
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Whose fault is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

410
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm disruptive for asking you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

412
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 1>but you also should pay for the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You delay.</v>

413
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he's calling bs on them.</v>

414
00:19:13.071 --> 00:19:13.904
<v Speaker 1>I get why they don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it also is a call to action to them </v>

415
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:18.583
<v Speaker 1>to like answer the question and rule in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a way that is sensible and wise and </v>

416
00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:25.190
<v Speaker 1>sustainable and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the byline on the book.</v>

417
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.360
<v Speaker 2>How is selfish ruling classes bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>America to the brink of revolution?</v>

418
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we're that close?</v>

419
00:19:32.301 --> 00:19:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just elected Donald Trump.</v>

420
00:19:35.451 --> 00:19:36.470
<v Speaker 1>President.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

421
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

422
00:19:38.571 --> 00:19:40.760
<v Speaker 1>this is what got me to write the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Donald Trump,</v>

423
00:19:40.761 --> 00:19:44.180
<v Speaker 1>who I've known for 20 years and always </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of liked because we're like,</v>

424
00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:46.220
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just funny as hell.</v>

425
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever think he was racist or any,</v>

426
00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Speaker 1>any of those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like put aside the center part.</v>

427
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

428
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I think on some level everybody is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigoted.</v>

429
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the human heart is dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a light and you know,</v>

430
00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:01.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a patchwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like talk about.</v>

431
00:20:01.371 --> 00:20:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he has a policy,</v>

432
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:04.790
<v Speaker 1>if he were to get up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

433
00:20:04.791 --> 00:20:09.791
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that this one racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>group is screwing everybody else.</v>

434
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And in response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to crush that,</v>

435
00:20:12.831 --> 00:20:15.920
<v Speaker 1>we need to attack them in public and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then make it much harder for them to get</v>

436
00:20:15.921 --> 00:20:16.430
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

437
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Government contracts get into school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be racist.</v>

438
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait.</v>

439
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what our ruling class has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing for 35 years.</v>

440
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

441
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.980
<v Speaker 1>You want really wanna have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about racism.</v>

442
00:20:27.981 --> 00:20:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Racism is attacking people on the basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their immutable characteristics,</v>

443
00:20:31.641 --> 00:20:33.980
<v Speaker 1>which is like how our government </v>
<v Speaker 1>operates.</v>

444
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It's totally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

445
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.753
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of racism is trumping </v>

446
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.360
<v Speaker 1>offender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably who isn't,</v>

447
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.463
<v Speaker 1>but the actual structural racism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurts people and rewards others on the </v>

448
00:20:46.281 --> 00:20:47.114
<v Speaker 1>basis of their skin color or something I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought we got rid of 50 years ago that </v>

449
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:50.764
<v Speaker 1>is not being perpetuated by trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's being perpetuated and defended and </v>

450
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:54.274
<v Speaker 1>celebrated by his critics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't lecture me or anyone else about </v>

451
00:20:56.771 --> 00:21:00.100
<v Speaker 1>racism if you're pushing that crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the irony?</v>

452
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:00.953
<v Speaker 1>It's half the guests that you have on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your show are the people who are </v>

453
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:06.360
<v Speaker 1>actually trying to inject racism into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

454
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Quotas and the rest of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

455
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they doing this?</v>

456
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>

457
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:17.131
<v Speaker 1>but at root it's much easier to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 1>power when you divide your opponents,</v>

458
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:18.454
<v Speaker 1>when you divide the country into warring</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes based on characteristics that </v>

459
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 1>don't change and therefore can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolved.</v>

460
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how the British ruled India.</v>

461
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.263
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with Rwanda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is like a very well known </v>

462
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:29.890
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway.</v>

463
00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all projection and displacement.</v>

464
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like whatever I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm accusing you of doing like,</v>

465
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

466
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 1>and it's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually orwellian because it's not</v>

467
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:45.010
<v Speaker 1>a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the mirror image of the truth.</v>

468
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your.</v>

469
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.260
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're fighting constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your show.</v>

470
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.310
<v Speaker 1>It actually gives you a headache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have a bunch of kids and they lie</v>

471
00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:54.144
<v Speaker 1>because everybody lies and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially lied to the people you love </v>

472
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 1>because you care about their opinion.</v>

473
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Most so kids lie to their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a feature of it,</v>

474
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.593
<v Speaker 1>but a child's lie is very recognizable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's always three shades off </v>

475
00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:08.470
<v Speaker 1>from the literal truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you a tenorio's no,</v>

476
00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I just had three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's contesting that you ate the</v>

477
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:11.974
<v Speaker 1>Oreos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

478
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.300
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is what all </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian regimes do in Norwell.</v>

479
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Being the great genius and English ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>got right to the heart of it.</v>

480
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:21.310
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 1>if I were dealing with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a powerful leftist,</v>

482
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I would say you wait three hours and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

483
00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually you did.</v>

484
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 1>You get the Oreos and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>punish.</v>

485
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.431
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

486
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:31.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>

487
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.433
<v Speaker 1>It's actually much more effective and </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulative not to grade the truth and </v>

488
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:40.894
<v Speaker 1>distort the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to tell the opposite of the truth </v>

489
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:45.150
<v Speaker 1>because it throws the other person </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely off.</v>

490
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.530
<v Speaker 1>That's been why they hate all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed minorities who,</v>

491
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.430
<v Speaker 1>who walk away leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

492
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.280
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing they hate more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay person.</v>

493
00:22:54.281 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 1>That leaves a black person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

494
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.210
<v Speaker 1>An Asian person that leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

495
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine I have just because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my job.</v>

496
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:02.734
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know a lot of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissent from the Orthodoxy within their </v>

497
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:08.150
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

498
00:23:08.151 --> 00:23:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Because I try to have them on because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're brave.</v>

499
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.373
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not involved in any of these </v>

500
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so,</v>

501
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:14.703
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like if you're a gay guy who was </v>

502
00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:16.091
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

503
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really on board with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens to you?</v>

504
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.730
<v Speaker 1>It's and I have deep sympathy for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter lately,</v>

505
00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but no I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never go there because it upsets</v>

506
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:24.694
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the end the individual has a </v>

507
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:28.900
<v Speaker 1>right to make up his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can control what I do.</v>

508
00:23:28.901 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Societies get to do that.</v>

509
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 1>They get to control the behavior of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who live with them.</v>

510
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to sleep in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crosswalk.</v>

511
00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't allow it.</v>

512
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.003
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you can't do is control what I </v>

513
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:38.134
<v Speaker 1>think that's not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That crosses the line from order to </v>

514
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism and all of a sudden for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time in my life,</v>

515
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 1>that's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not simply attempting,</v>

516
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:48.190
<v Speaker 1>but demanding.</v>

517
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

518
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:49.523
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then that's a perfect segue to the </v>

519
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:51.843
<v Speaker 2>technological part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think the last time I was on </v>

520
00:23:54.551 --> 00:23:56.140
<v Speaker 2>your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we discussed.</v>

521
00:23:56.141 --> 00:23:56.974
<v Speaker 2>Just going on with Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on with the algorithms are </v>

522
00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:01.450
<v Speaker 2>people be in shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>banned,</v>

523
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.340
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>

524
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I think thEre's plenty of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

525
00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:08.320
<v Speaker 2>this is all real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your solution to this?</v>

526
00:24:08.321 --> 00:24:09.154
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect you don't want the government </v>

527
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.820
<v Speaker 2>coming in and fixing them.</v>

528
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Or Is this a unique case now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

529
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:16.780
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

530
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:17.703
<v Speaker 1>it's an I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the term existential </v>

531
00:24:19.531 --> 00:24:21.510
<v Speaker 1>threat because it's been all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>overused,</v>

532
00:24:21.511 --> 00:24:22.344
<v Speaker 1>but actually it is an existential threat</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ability of the us government to </v>

533
00:24:25.681 --> 00:24:28.410
<v Speaker 1>run the country to administer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>

534
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

535
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>google.</v>

536
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.340
<v Speaker 1>There are 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers,</v>

537
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.670
<v Speaker 1>engineers making between two and </v>
<v Speaker 1>$400,000</v>

538
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.600
<v Speaker 1>working right now just on google search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just on that one feature of google,</v>

539
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.553
<v Speaker 1>20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the most technologically </v>

540
00:24:45.781 --> 00:24:48.750
<v Speaker 1>advanced and powerful organization in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of the world.</v>

541
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.200
<v Speaker 1>It's technology and capabilities so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>outstrip those to the pentagon,</v>

542
00:24:52.201 --> 00:24:53.034
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the chinese military or the </v>

543
00:24:54.661 --> 00:24:56.580
<v Speaker 1>russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the russians or any other group.</v>

544
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.623
<v Speaker 1>This is the most powerful technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>entity in the world which has a </v>

545
00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:02.310
<v Speaker 1>chokehold on all human information in </v>
<v Speaker 1>english.</v>

546
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.730
<v Speaker 1>So that is all sort of all you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

547
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if jesus is in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

548
00:25:07.921 --> 00:25:12.000
<v Speaker 1>That's too much power for any entity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have and it's a,</v>

549
00:25:12.001 --> 00:25:14.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a threat to the nation state </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

550
00:25:14.291 --> 00:25:16.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's a threat to all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

551
00:25:16.591 --> 00:25:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I think whatever it takes is what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do.</v>

552
00:25:21.001 --> 00:25:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Like now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a tough pill for a conservative?</v>

553
00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.190
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding?</v>

554
00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

555
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I would say not to go to motive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it when people do that,</v>

556
00:25:28.651 --> 00:25:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but in fact a lot of just flat out </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought off by google.</v>

557
00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Google literally funds the antitrust </v>
<v Speaker 1>think tank in Washington.</v>

558
00:25:36.811 --> 00:25:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not speaking for ian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

559
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:40.800
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

560
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.320
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so a symmetrical like all these</v>

561
00:25:43.321 --> 00:25:46.920
<v Speaker 1>debates are because with liberals who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are only about power,</v>

562
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.450
<v Speaker 1>you just make the pitch like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

563
00:25:48.451 --> 00:25:52.020
<v Speaker 1>we'll fund you were on your side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

564
00:25:52.021 --> 00:25:53.820
<v Speaker 1>that we're part of the coalition of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ascendant.</v>

565
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.240
<v Speaker 1>So just like no problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>

566
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.450
<v Speaker 1>all they who are sort of like dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the eu market.</v>

567
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.620
<v Speaker 1>You knoW what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

568
00:26:01.621 --> 00:26:06.120
<v Speaker 1>what are you against markets you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>government control you for regulation.</v>

569
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I ran and ran and ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conserves and like,</v>

570
00:26:08.491 --> 00:26:09.480
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kryptonite.</v>

571
00:26:09.481 --> 00:26:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

572
00:26:10.501 --> 00:26:11.730
<v Speaker 1>You're totally right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mr google.</v>

573
00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.660
<v Speaker 1>It's actually and so I feel like I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only person who like,</v>

574
00:26:15.661 --> 00:26:16.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm concerned.</v>

575
00:26:16.561 --> 00:26:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm not for regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I believe in markets,</v>

576
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.360
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't a free mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your friend.</v>

577
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.223
<v Speaker 1>This is your version of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you've been promising all </v>

578
00:26:23.641 --> 00:26:26.430
<v Speaker 1>these years when like two guys who run a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

579
00:26:26.431 --> 00:26:27.264
<v Speaker 1>it's not even american whose values are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not aligned with the interest of my </v>

580
00:26:29.821 --> 00:26:32.330
<v Speaker 1>country is in charge of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

581
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not for that.</v>

582
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.853
<v Speaker 2>Sorry I got to say this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not think that I was going to </v>

583
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:36.104
<v Speaker 2>bring you in here and that I'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>tucker carlson agreeing with my friend </v>

584
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:41.780
<v Speaker 2>eric weinstein about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you're basically laying out the</v>

585
00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 2>same case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's lit</v>

586
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.240
<v Speaker 1>big</v>

587
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 2>and and sometimes I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I'm going crazy.</v>

588
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:47.874
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm thinking about this too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm becoming like the wacko who's </v>

589
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:53.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand us actually.</v>

590
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:54.610
<v Speaker 2>The deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

591
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.453
<v Speaker 2>And I know people who work there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually spent a lot of time on it </v>

592
00:26:57.361 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 2>because I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know,</v>

593
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:00.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm overstating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

594
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not temperamentally an extremist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always.</v>

595
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm from southern California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm a kind of semi observant </v>
<v Speaker 2>episcopalian.</v>

597
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like now where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

598
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:10.550
<v Speaker 2>the end is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

599
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not the way I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on this topic,</v>

600
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm becoming that because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the facts warranted.</v>

601
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.223
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of the whole shift of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what's happening with news and </v>

602
00:27:21.901 --> 00:27:24.580
<v Speaker 2>technology at the moment that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

603
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said this to you in the green room,</v>

604
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:28.500
<v Speaker 2>but when I was doing a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the peterson last week,</v>

605
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

606
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tucker carlson's on my show next week.</v>

607
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.700
<v Speaker 2>The audience went wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

608
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 2>we're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

609
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:34.794
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting because I hear from </v>

610
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:39.100
<v Speaker 2>so many of these young people that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get their new uh,</v>

611
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 2>from cable news anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you and gutfeld are a little bit</v>

612
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:45.810
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bridge sort of between mainstream</v>

613
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:47.220
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the internet thing,</v>

614
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:48.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

615
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.233
<v Speaker 2>that cnn has sort of become a joke that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just saying these things about </v>

616
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.333
<v Speaker 2>cable news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's already the punchline and </v>

617
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I spent many years at cnn and hosting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show there and had a lot of,</v>

618
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.540
<v Speaker 2>have a look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have friends there.</v>

619
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean the landscape changes technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

620
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 2>destroys and creates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a very familiar cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cable news has remained relevant</v>

622
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:09.630
<v Speaker 2>much longer than a lot of us who work in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thought it would.</v>

623
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.010
<v Speaker 2>But that of course will change because </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically,</v>

624
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.500
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology changes everything.</v>

625
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.700
<v Speaker 2>What's ominous is the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely for digital media.</v>

626
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:18.923
<v Speaker 2>I owned part of a digital media company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've sort of wound up exactly in </v>

627
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.690
<v Speaker 2>not in the opposite place we expected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wind up.</v>

628
00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean the promise was that this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to diversify,</v>

629
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:32.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media and decentralized power over </v>

630
00:28:36.271 --> 00:28:38.070
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course the opposite,</v>

631
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:39.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little controls everything.</v>

632
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.910
<v Speaker 2>So without youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean where are you with that youtube?</v>

633
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:46.740
<v Speaker 2>So we're actually fInding ourselves more</v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent upon a smaller group of people</v>

634
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.410
<v Speaker 2>who hate free speech and hate our </v>
<v Speaker 2>values.</v>

635
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.693
<v Speaker 2>That's a very precarious place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody needs to introduce competition </v>

636
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 2>into the space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yesterday,</v>

637
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.710
<v Speaker 2>like right now it's the most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

638
00:28:58.711 --> 00:29:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise we're going to find ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>like at the mercy of these stars.</v>

639
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.233
<v Speaker 2>Like is that where you want to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite of where you want to </v>

640
00:29:04.741 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

641
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.873
<v Speaker 2>If only there were some influential </v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaires to be listening to this </v>

642
00:29:12.271 --> 00:29:14.400
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to name names,</v>

643
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.443
<v Speaker 2>but whenever two or more people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought thIs through for 10 minutes get </v>

644
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:18.684
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they mentioned one name and they're </v>

645
00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:21.120
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is he coming to save us?</v>

646
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Well now you said it's a heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's not get lost in gender.</v>

647
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.913
<v Speaker 2>So with that being said about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological component watching cable </v>

648
00:29:28.051 --> 00:29:28.884
<v Speaker 2>news shift right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also an issue that a lot of </v>

649
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:32.304
<v Speaker 2>people are getting their news from this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from this show shows like this shapiro </v>

650
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 2>rower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these guys.</v>

651
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of worrying to at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

652
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.913
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say that I'm talking about guys </v>

653
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:43.780
<v Speaker 2>that I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

654
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 2>just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

655
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 2>the fact checking is different here than</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it would be on cable news.</v>

656
00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Not that cable news has done a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

657
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>

658
00:29:51.811 --> 00:29:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

659
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.160
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always,</v>

660
00:29:55.161 --> 00:29:57.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point on a continuum and we're,</v>

661
00:29:57.061 --> 00:30:01.950
<v Speaker 1>we're in the middle of a cycle where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media are being reinvented completely.</v>

662
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

663
00:30:03.841 --> 00:30:04.674
<v Speaker 1>the problem with individual operators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solo guys on youtube is they have so </v>

664
00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:11.370
<v Speaker 1>much less to lose than a television </v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

665
00:30:11.371 --> 00:30:12.204
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the incentives to get the facts right </v>

666
00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:15.420
<v Speaker 1>and be responsible of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much lower.</v>

667
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem as you well know better than</v>

668
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.220
<v Speaker 1>anybody is that the media has so </v>
<v Speaker 1>discredited themselves that it's like,</v>

669
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.713
<v Speaker 1>it's so obviously propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did you ever think it could be that </v>

670
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.981
<v Speaker 1>bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

671
00:30:28.981 --> 00:30:29.814
<v Speaker 1>I never did.</v>

672
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.323
<v Speaker 2>Every day I look at a story from cnn or </v>
<v Speaker 2>political and forget buzzfeed and all </v>

673
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.780
<v Speaker 2>those other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the really bad ones,</v>

674
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.183
<v Speaker 2>vox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like everything you guys are </v>

675
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:41.674
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every headline and the way every </v>

676
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:45.920
<v Speaker 2>republican has a picture that they look </v>
<v Speaker 2>awful in the picture.</v>

677
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Democrats look great and like every </v>
<v Speaker 2>little thing,</v>

678
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like there</v>

679
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:53.100
<v Speaker 1>smashing us with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just turned it up to 11.</v>

680
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

681
00:30:54.751 --> 00:30:55.584
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a media family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my dad was anchor here in la of </v>

682
00:30:58.381 --> 00:30:59.214
<v Speaker 1>abc and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have always lived in this world and I </v>

683
00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:04.050
<v Speaker 1>always thought the media are liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was totally wrong about that.</v>

684
00:31:04.051 --> 00:31:06.240
<v Speaker 1>They're not ideologues actually their </v>
<v Speaker 1>party people.</v>

685
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what I totally missed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

686
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.083
<v Speaker 1>They are loyal to the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel powerless except as part of a </v>

687
00:31:11.671 --> 00:31:15.480
<v Speaker 1>group that is the main distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between left and right in this country.</v>

688
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.870
<v Speaker 1>And so whatever the democratic party's </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperatives are,</v>

689
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.823
<v Speaker 1>they will act on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the demOcratic party invaded Canada </v>

690
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.050
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and they wouldn't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious,</v>

691
00:31:25.051 --> 00:31:25.681
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

692
00:31:25.681 --> 00:31:28.400
<v Speaker 1>these canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live among us there.</v>

693
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a fifth column.</v>

694
00:31:29.881 --> 00:31:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Like they would actually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the part is,</v>

695
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.920
<v Speaker 1>they will defend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you understand that,</v>

696
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.800
<v Speaker 1>then it all makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel threatened.</v>

697
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth in you and people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are the main threat to them.</v>

698
00:31:41.161 --> 00:31:44.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not me actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a competing medium,</v>

699
00:31:44.221 --> 00:31:45.054
<v Speaker 1>but in the same medium they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that their power is epic and </v>

700
00:31:51.151 --> 00:31:52.650
<v Speaker 1>when you feel like you're losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

701
00:31:52.651 --> 00:31:53.484
<v Speaker 1>that's when you tried to assert control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the most ludicrous </v>

702
00:31:55.651 --> 00:31:57.870
<v Speaker 1>propaganda comes when you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:31:57.871 --> 00:31:59.310
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not listening to me.</v>

704
00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the funny part.</v>

705
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Part is I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tweet this all the time,</v>

706
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:06.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like if these guys had just been </v>
<v Speaker 2>like pretty bad.</v>

707
00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would have been tolerable.</v>

708
00:32:08.951 --> 00:32:11.650
<v Speaker 2>People would have because it had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening for so long.</v>

709
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:12.603
<v Speaker 2>People kind of wooded and have noticed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe they could have got a little </v>

710
00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:16.150
<v Speaker 2>worse than we would have been okay with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

711
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's like they've just completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottomed out and.</v>

712
00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:21.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the criticisms of trump </v>

713
00:32:22.971 --> 00:32:24.740
<v Speaker 1>that has a lot of truth in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people are like,</v>

714
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:25.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a destroyer.</v>

715
00:32:25.671 --> 00:32:28.280
<v Speaker 1>He destroys everything he touches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

716
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.190
<v Speaker 1>probably an overstatement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he does,</v>

717
00:32:31.191 --> 00:32:32.024
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get close to you sit and stare at </v>

718
00:32:33.291 --> 00:32:36.500
<v Speaker 1>trump all day and you're going to burn </v>
<v Speaker 1>out your news.</v>

719
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.653
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

720
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of those I try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do a show about trump.</v>

721
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't write a book about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not against trump.</v>

722
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I think trump is useful in a truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>teller in some ways,</v>

723
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:46.124
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people who obsess about trump </v>

724
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.990
<v Speaker 1>are destroyed and that would include his</v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents,</v>

725
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe especially his opponent.</v>

726
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.250
<v Speaker 2>So what would you do to get some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people back if they're,</v>

727
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:56.084
<v Speaker 2>if they are out there now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that really are overboard on </v>

728
00:32:57.951 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 2>trump that I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

729
00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.180
<v Speaker 2>I've been able to reach them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some liberalism,</v>

730
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.320
<v Speaker 2>good lefties and liberals so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

731
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:04.154
<v Speaker 2>we can put a hand out for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the people that are really </v>

732
00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:09.880
<v Speaker 2>feeling like they're buying all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense and the skies,</v>

733
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:14.060
<v Speaker 2>hitler and all of this really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have any technique that</v>

734
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I almost never argue about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really try not to.</v>

735
00:33:18.091 --> 00:33:18.924
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the platonic ideal for me of a show is </v>

736
00:33:20.251 --> 00:33:23.130
<v Speaker 1>never mentioning trump because I try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the long view.</v>

737
00:33:23.131 --> 00:33:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other shows had different roles,</v>

738
00:33:24.721 --> 00:33:25.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody sees like his or her specific </v>

739
00:33:27.301 --> 00:33:28.134
<v Speaker 1>tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like mine is to try to take </v>

740
00:33:30.031 --> 00:33:30.864
<v Speaker 1>the long view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not easy in the middle of this new </v>

741
00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.563
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I get caught up all the time </v>

742
00:33:34.591 --> 00:33:35.480
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:36.730
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

744
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.020
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really try to think about like,</v>

745
00:33:40.021 --> 00:33:41.820
<v Speaker 1>well how would this look 10 years from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

746
00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump Will be gone.</v>

747
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.093
<v Speaker 1>I'll be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll all be gone because we actually </v>

748
00:33:45.511 --> 00:33:46.920
<v Speaker 1>die at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out so.</v>

749
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:50.470
<v Speaker 1>But I want the country to 10 years for </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years.</v>

750
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.550
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of country do you want?</v>

751
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:57.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to live in a place where the</v>

752
00:33:57.031 --> 00:34:00.360
<v Speaker 1>individual has the right to dissent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think most people would say yes,</v>

753
00:34:00.361 --> 00:34:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

754
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Is that why the free speech stuff has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become so important to you?</v>

755
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that it's foundational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

756
00:34:06.931 --> 00:34:09.720
<v Speaker 1>that's just if they can tell you what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

757
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:13.050
<v Speaker 1>they can control what you think and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can control you,</v>

758
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:15.690
<v Speaker 1>think you're not fully human and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really.</v>

759
00:34:15.691 --> 00:34:16.524
<v Speaker 1>You're not fIghting for a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>party or an ideology or fighting for </v>

760
00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:20.124
<v Speaker 1>your humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's what I was taught </v>

761
00:34:21.871 --> 00:34:25.440
<v Speaker 1>as a child by liberals and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and I bought it then by the way,</v>

762
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.810
<v Speaker 1>and so the acl used to the for </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearance.</v>

763
00:34:27.811 --> 00:34:28.644
<v Speaker 1>Brandon berg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who Is not only at literally a clansman </v>

764
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.910
<v Speaker 1>from Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a moron like a literally a moron.</v>

765
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:36.773
<v Speaker 1>He was the least appealing person ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they stick their entire credibility </v>

766
00:34:40.171 --> 00:34:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and defending this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they do that.</v>

767
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:44.040
<v Speaker 1>They did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

768
00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:44.874
<v Speaker 1>to preserve the absolute right of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech for the rest of us and they made </v>

769
00:34:47.311 --> 00:34:49.200
<v Speaker 1>the country better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you abandon that,</v>

770
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

771
00:34:50.191 --> 00:34:50.750
<v Speaker 1>it's over</v>

772
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.480
<v Speaker 2>and now you see what comes out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aco and you're like,</v>

773
00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:55.550
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not defending free speech.</v>

774
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:58.870
<v Speaker 2>You're clearly a progressive group.</v>

775
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.300
<v Speaker 1>They're opposing statements saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

776
00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:06.190
<v Speaker 1>some speeches is to offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really because you defended the right of</v>

777
00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:07.024
<v Speaker 1>nazis to march through skokie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which everyone forgets had the highest </v>

778
00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:14.250
<v Speaker 1>percentage of holocaust survivors of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>town like outside Israel.</v>

779
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was the most offensive thing </v>

780
00:35:16.211 --> 00:35:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you could do and they defended it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they lost a lot of money doing it.</v>

781
00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Like they lost a ton of donations doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

782
00:35:21.191 --> 00:35:24.570
<v Speaker 1>but they defended the principal and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed you've got nadian strauss's book</v>

783
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.833
<v Speaker 1>we talked about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are people like her are </v>

784
00:35:27.881 --> 00:35:32.770
<v Speaker 1>dershowitz are these former clu board </v>
<v Speaker 1>members who were like totally bewildered</v>

785
00:35:32.771 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 1>by this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because we care about the acl.</v>

786
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.543
<v Speaker 1>You as an institution who cares and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb nonprofit because the principles </v>

787
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 1>are literally foundational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

788
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.080
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>

789
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.380
<v Speaker 2>let's jump back for just a second here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk about fox generally.</v>

790
00:35:45.381 --> 00:35:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first off,</v>

791
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you guys are doing something right and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't mean just you hear clearly,</v>

792
00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:52.544
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just looked at this thing and it's </v>

793
00:35:53.871 --> 00:35:56.690
<v Speaker 2>like the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom 20 shows are all cnn.</v>

794
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.823
<v Speaker 2>The top 10 are basically all fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's one msnbc show in there </v>

795
00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.190
<v Speaker 2>beyond just you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

796
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.220
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that fox is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it all right.</v>

797
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being slightly different.</v>

798
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

799
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that the,</v>

800
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can only speak for my shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only in charge of an hour of the,</v>

801
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:13.223
<v Speaker 1>of 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know that it's actually worth </v>

802
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:16.944
<v Speaker 1>defending the principles as distinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the individuals or the political </v>

803
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 1>figures in overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not embarrassed to do that.</v>

804
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:24.684
<v Speaker 1>It's worth doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think as a business matter and </v>

805
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:32.190
<v Speaker 1>just sort of a matter of life if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's not entirely with the herd</v>

806
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:33.570
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually no,</v>

807
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

808
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.443
<v Speaker 1>you go to the 19 other stores when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can buy this one product and I've got a </v>

809
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:41.400
<v Speaker 1>different product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why is that bad?</v>

810
00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that just seems obvious.</v>

811
00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 1>That's just human nature is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive that is.</v>

812
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like fog and I've worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked at cnn,</v>

813
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I've worked at msnbc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at pbs,</v>

814
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:50.993
<v Speaker 1>I worked at esquire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm and I've worked at like a million </v>

815
00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:52.764
<v Speaker 1>different liberal publications and </v>
<v Speaker 1>television channels and they're all </v>

816
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:57.354
<v Speaker 1>selling exactly the same product and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's fox in the mainstream </v>

817
00:36:59.971 --> 00:37:04.971
<v Speaker 1>landscape that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one channel is different and the,</v>

818
00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.400
<v Speaker 1>the feeling overwhelming feeling is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not be allowed.</v>

819
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't believe that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to say what they're saying.</v>

820
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 1>We need to shut them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's</v>

821
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:14.343
<v Speaker 2>the irony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you guys are the only ones </v>

822
00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:19.420
<v Speaker 2>that will put me on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will gladly go on cnn or msnbc,</v>

823
00:37:19.421 --> 00:37:21.280
<v Speaker 2>get on those channels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been asked.</v>

824
00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I can't just show up there and bang on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the door,</v>

825
00:37:23.261 --> 00:37:26.140
<v Speaker 2>but you guys call me and nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I've done your show,</v>

826
00:37:26.141 --> 00:37:28.060
<v Speaker 2>it's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never know what you're going to ask.</v>

827
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:29.443
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and same thing with some of the other </v>

828
00:37:30.341 --> 00:37:34.090
<v Speaker 2>shows and it's like I will go where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can talk to people.</v>

829
00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be edited and </v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresented,</v>

830
00:37:36.731 --> 00:37:38.200
<v Speaker 2>which.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know that I would trust a lot</v>

831
00:37:38.201 --> 00:37:39.080
<v Speaker 2>of these other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

832
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.863
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that sort of.</v>

833
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.830
<v Speaker 1>But it's just so uninteresting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

834
00:37:42.831 --> 00:37:43.664
<v Speaker 1>if everybody's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeating the exact same pieties </v>

835
00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.830
<v Speaker 1>diversity is our strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our children,</v>

836
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.683
<v Speaker 1>our future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever this sort of banality is that </v>

837
00:37:51.141 --> 00:37:51.974
<v Speaker 1>you think is profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everybody is saying the exact same </v>

838
00:37:53.901 --> 00:37:54.980
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is boring.</v>

839
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:56.383
<v Speaker 1>I like to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to have people on who surprised </v>

840
00:37:58.311 --> 00:37:59.144
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

841
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because again,</v>

842
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm more curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a human being.</v>

843
00:38:05.361 --> 00:38:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

844
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I want to think about things.</v>

845
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Does it ever drive you crazy to just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

846
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:11.070
<v Speaker 2>in the constraints of what television </v>
<v Speaker 2>is?</v>

847
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Because we've done segments where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

848
00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:14.214
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got maybe six minutes and I feel </v>

849
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 2>like I just started and then yoU're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

850
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:17.640
<v Speaker 2>robin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll See you next time.</v>

851
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:18.080
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

852
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was a writer before I went into</v>

853
00:38:19.941 --> 00:38:20.774
<v Speaker 1>tv and one of the reasons that I failed </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of times pretty spectacularly </v>

854
00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:27.440
<v Speaker 1>and tv is because I didn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the medium and I didn't respect it.</v>

855
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a writer,</v>

856
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm a deep person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here I am in the shallow medium.</v>

857
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And what I didn't understand is it tv </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

858
00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:34.994
<v Speaker 1>it's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing and it's got its </v>

859
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:42.420
<v Speaker 1>own requirements and its own rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to understand what it's capable</v>

860
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 1>of and is capable of great things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not capable of everything.</v>

861
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not capable of explaining concepts,</v>

862
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.920
<v Speaker 1>complex concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that's not what tv is about.</v>

863
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Someone was for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it odd to you that the interview,</v>

864
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:57.030
<v Speaker 1>the real long form this like just sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>down with another human being that,</v>

865
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cnn booted Larry King,</v>

866
00:38:58.751 --> 00:39:00.640
<v Speaker 1>which I think was the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end for them.</v>

867
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 1>So smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I really believe it.</v>

868
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've never heard anybody else say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

869
00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:06.470
<v Speaker 1>but I argued that when I worked there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

870
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you were.</v>

871
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.713
<v Speaker 1>Because they were getting rid of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he told me he was here a couple </v>

872
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:11.291
<v Speaker 1>of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

873
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:13.190
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was the number one rated </v>
<v Speaker 1>show is still on the network.</v>

874
00:39:13.191 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 1>it was number two at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

875
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

876
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.210
<v Speaker 1>we're done 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adios.</v>

877
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also ended crossfire,</v>

878
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.000
<v Speaker 1>which had become a kind of perversion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its former self,</v>

879
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:22.834
<v Speaker 1>but I was in both versions of it and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one point crossfire was like a public </v>

880
00:39:25.421 --> 00:39:26.570
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

881
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.423
<v Speaker 1>to sort of equally matched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did something shift with crossfire </v>

882
00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:32.290
<v Speaker 1>because I do remember watching you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossfire and watching those guys.</v>

883
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>And it was so it became partisan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Uninteresting.</v>

884
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to hear what your team </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks.</v>

885
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.480
<v Speaker 1>We already know what's interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we throw up an idea or a policy and</v>

886
00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:46.090
<v Speaker 1>we deconstructed and we have two fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>evenly matched people,</v>

887
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of competing for,</v>

888
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.790
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

889
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 1>it became something much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea was aLways a good idea.</v>

890
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.133
<v Speaker 1>And especially the idea of Larry King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pitched that show too many different </v>

891
00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:02.080
<v Speaker 1>channels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black curtain to people,</v>

892
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.153
<v Speaker 1>our lonG conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my argument was this will rate </v>

893
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 1>people want this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's none of it.</v>

894
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.500
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's like good Things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need to interstitials in graphics.</v>

895
00:40:11.501 --> 00:40:14.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's like they love interstitial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

896
00:40:14.441 --> 00:40:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course with youtube,</v>

897
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:17.643
<v Speaker 1>it's like you look at the numbers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting and others are getting </v>

898
00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:25.540
<v Speaker 1>with that exact format and they're huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out,</v>

899
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there's a market for that.</v>

900
00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't there be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of all of this?</v>

901
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:29.943
<v Speaker 1>Everything we're discussing here and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of what you're doing on your show </v>

902
00:40:31.601 --> 00:40:36.280
<v Speaker 1>is just that people are just tired of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having their intellect insulted.</v>

903
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

904
00:40:38.141 --> 00:40:42.070
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at television versus movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had told me 30 years ago that the</v>

905
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:43.700
<v Speaker 1>most interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

906
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.960
<v Speaker 1>visual art being created would be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

907
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.330
<v Speaker 1>scripted television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

908
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so that's the province of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moron,</v>

909
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 1>like full house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

910
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but it turned out to be true because to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up for bob saget,</v>

911
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.560
<v Speaker 1>bob saget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bob saget,</v>

912
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but she's actually very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that there is,</v>

913
00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:09.010
<v Speaker 1>especially when we're all narrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>casting,</v>

914
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 1>when you don't need to reach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

915
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.513
<v Speaker 1>$80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people when you can reach 3 </v>

916
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.513
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a more than viable </v>

917
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:17.913
<v Speaker 1>commercial proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can aim at an audience that wants </v>

918
00:41:21.281 --> 00:41:22.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is a substantial audience that</v>

919
00:41:22.931 --> 00:41:23.460
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

920
00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

921
00:41:24.101 --> 00:41:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So fox news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get it.</v>

922
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Some things are clearly going right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>by ratings and everything else.</v>

923
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that fox is doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think is wrong?</v>

924
00:41:31.601 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Is he too close to the or or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

925
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

926
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm obviously I'm dodging the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

927
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Even if I had a real answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would run from that question because I</v>

928
00:41:40.641 --> 00:41:42.160
<v Speaker 1>worked there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask you a hundred.</v>

929
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm being completely honest,</v>

930
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a huge.</v>

931
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:46.933
<v Speaker 1>I'm so caught up in our hour and I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a hive in my show and we have </v>

932
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:55.180
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

933
00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.013
<v Speaker 1>I intentionally hired really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than I am people that I don't </v>

934
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.900
<v Speaker 1>have a sense sometimes of the larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>programming.</v>

935
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I would say as a general matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always tried not to be aligned with</v>

936
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:10.610
<v Speaker 1>any politician because in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how sympathetic it might be to</v>

937
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:13.090
<v Speaker 1>the message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a politician and I'm not.</v>

938
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.420
<v Speaker 1>If I wanted to be a policy maker I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be one because it's a pretty low bar for</v>

939
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns on certain sound.</v>

940
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.291
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

941
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 1>So do you ever think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not for two seconds.</v>

942
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I would never want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

943
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I live in that world so I know what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

944
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a journalist temperament.</v>

945
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:32.354
<v Speaker 1>I like to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the freedom to say what I really </v>

946
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:34.874
<v Speaker 1>think is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want one thing I will say about </v>

947
00:42:36.441 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 1>fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I am grateful for every single day</v>

948
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 1>and this is rupert murdoch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

949
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.260
<v Speaker 1>they do not control what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had this show for two years,</v>

950
00:42:45.261 --> 00:42:46.094
<v Speaker 1>almost exactly two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a single time of someone called you </v>

951
00:42:48.771 --> 00:42:51.440
<v Speaker 1>or no one calls me at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like no one calls in is like,</v>

952
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you said there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

953
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Pure editorial freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like why is that not a great job?</v>

954
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

955
00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

956
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:00.164
<v Speaker 1>I just want to illustrate because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand that every time I've </v>

957
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Gone on your show that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

958
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 1>they give you some sense of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about and that's it.</v>

959
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:08.714
<v Speaker 1>We go live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's live and if you want to say </v>

960
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:12.130
<v Speaker 1>something insane like we can't stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

961
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

962
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 1>and I would say the other thing is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way tv works,</v>

963
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.290
<v Speaker 1>at least at our network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is true.</v>

964
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.000
<v Speaker 1>When I worked at the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was also true.</v>

965
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.090
<v Speaker 1>The shows have enormous autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really do.</v>

966
00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:23.924
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's not a morning call where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like here's our line on this or </v>

967
00:43:26.091 --> 00:43:28.190
<v Speaker 1>that or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I never talked to any.</v>

968
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.380
<v Speaker 1>I talked to my executive producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin wells,</v>

969
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:31.214
<v Speaker 1>whom I love and a lot of my other </v>
<v Speaker 1>producers all morning and just in the </v>

970
00:43:33.471 --> 00:43:34.190
<v Speaker 1>car parked outside.</v>

971
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing a show like here's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should do.</v>

972
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.020
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can do whatever we want.</v>

973
00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

974
00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.530
<v Speaker 1>what's your day to day like over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know what it's like to do.</v>

975
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I do a couple shows a week and I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>long form and this way,</v>

976
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:46.424
<v Speaker 1>but we're not doing a zillion segments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all and all the interstitials and </v>

977
00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:51.080
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your sort of day to day?</v>

978
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Tucker wakes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got to show that night.</v>

979
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I try and I'm married.</v>

980
00:43:55.131 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I've been married for 27 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked my wife.</v>

981
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 1>My kids are all Gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I really try and stay home.</v>

982
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key in daily tv is not to go insane.</v>

983
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.460
<v Speaker 1>That actually is like the whole deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

984
00:44:07.461 --> 00:44:12.440
<v Speaker 1>If you can keep from becoming an </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecure sort of bag of neuroses,</v>

985
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:13.663
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you mean that just because of the </v>

986
00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:19.781
<v Speaker 1>media criticism and just constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about ratings and all of that,</v>

987
00:44:19.911 --> 00:44:20.744
<v Speaker 1>but just the medium itself leaves most </v>
<v Speaker 1>anchors at some point feeling totally </v>

988
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:26.960
<v Speaker 1>exposed and alone it's like I'm out </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

989
00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:27.794
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a staff of 80 people or </v>

990
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the end I'm out here to.</v>

991
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.033
<v Speaker 1>IT's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking all the crap and no one's </v>

992
00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:35.730
<v Speaker 1>backing me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

993
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:38.520
<v Speaker 1>every person in the business feels that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way at a certain point.</v>

994
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.130
<v Speaker 1>And then you start to feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

995
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 1>no one understands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

996
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:44.544
<v Speaker 1>And you actually become so self pitying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and self-involved that no matter how </v>

997
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:49.014
<v Speaker 1>much they pay you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your deeply unhappy and then you start </v>

998
00:44:51.161 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 1>acting erratic ways and like look at tv </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know exactly who's going through</v>

999
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:56.754
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1000
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.863
<v Speaker 1>Everybody except me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I keep my world's so small when </v>

1001
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:03.703
<v Speaker 1>I married my high school girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live walking distance from my dad and </v>

1002
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:06.744
<v Speaker 1>my brother and my college roommate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>best friend and that's who I talked to </v>

1003
00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:10.850
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

1004
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:12.523
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I do that is because I </v>

1005
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:14.754
<v Speaker 1>love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because I don't want to feel </v>

1006
00:45:18.511 --> 00:45:20.730
<v Speaker 1>the way that most people on tv do I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

1007
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to people I love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust and,</v>

1008
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 1>and I want my security and happiness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from those relationships.</v>

1009
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:28.223
<v Speaker 1>And not from the affirmation I get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television because you will become a </v>

1010
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:32.520
<v Speaker 1>crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone once said to me,</v>

1011
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.160
<v Speaker 1>the head of a tv network when said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think my job is?</v>

1012
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1013
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 1>running a tv network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1014
00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:39.204
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's keeping millionaires from killing </v>

1015
00:45:40.261 --> 00:45:42.180
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My job.</v>

1016
00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:43.830
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dark is that?</v>

1017
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:47.070
<v Speaker 1>It's also true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like his job was to keep the people</v>

1018
00:45:47.071 --> 00:45:47.904
<v Speaker 1>from going totally bananas because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium itself drives you crazy and </v>

1019
00:45:51.691 --> 00:45:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No booze,</v>

1020
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.360
<v Speaker 1>no cigarettes anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1021
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 1>You got any advice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The booze is easy.</v>

1022
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Drinking coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink problem,</v>

1023
00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drink a lot.</v>

1024
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Voltaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of coffee.</v>

1025
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Not quite as impressive effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1026
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.810
<v Speaker 1>like quit smoking four or five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

1027
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

1028
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1029
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a,</v>

1030
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.083
<v Speaker 1>I'm an enthusiastic user of nicotine gum</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lozenges because I think they </v>

1031
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.410
<v Speaker 1>really have improved my life like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1032
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to endorse the product.</v>

1033
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the downside is of using nicotine.</v>

1034
00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.293
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge downside from smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course the target gives you cancer </v>

1035
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:33.354
<v Speaker 1>and emphysema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1036
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.853
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that we've shown that </v>

1037
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:38.820
<v Speaker 1>nicotine for people who don't have blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure problems and I don't.</v>

1038
00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.293
<v Speaker 1>I'm hurts you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a lot of evidence </v>

1039
00:46:42.301 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 1>that that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1040
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.053
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want to spend the remaining time </v>

1041
00:46:45.571 --> 00:46:47.340
<v Speaker 2>really focusing on the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sort of did,</v>

1042
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I think we did everything we did </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else,</v>

1043
00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:52.410
<v Speaker 2>but let's really focus in on the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1044
00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.460
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're on the brink of a revolution,</v>

1045
00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:01.430
<v Speaker 1>what are your prescriptions to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1046
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I think the first thing you need to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is cool the temperature a little bit.</v>

1047
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:10.040
<v Speaker 1>presidents not good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not his by temperamentally.</v>

1048
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:13.010
<v Speaker 1>He's incapable of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he sees it as an important</v>

1049
00:47:13.011 --> 00:47:13.730
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>

1050
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.100
<v Speaker 2>So is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think the fundamental sort of,</v>

1051
00:47:16.101 --> 00:47:18.320
<v Speaker 2>if we're looking at this just at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a base level,</v>

1052
00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.021
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1053
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:21.350
<v Speaker 2>that trump's temperament and the way the</v>
<v Speaker 2>media is with him,</v>

1054
00:47:21.351 --> 00:47:23.330
<v Speaker 2>is that sort of the root of everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else?</v>

1055
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.330
<v Speaker 1>The volatilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

1056
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.553
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we needed to awaken the in </v>

1057
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:30.274
<v Speaker 1>charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not simply of our political system but </v>

1058
00:47:32.171 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 1>also of our economy and our culture from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their suPer,</v>

1059
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:36.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1060
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.383
<v Speaker 1>you're not listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to let this orange guy to </v>

1061
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:40.750
<v Speaker 1>wake you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that was a useful thing</v>

1062
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:41.584
<v Speaker 1>and necessary thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but repeated cycles of political </v>

1063
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:46.564
<v Speaker 1>volatility like break your country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a million examples of </v>

1064
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 1>this and it's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

1065
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:52.803
<v Speaker 1>you need to calm people down in the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>way you calm people down as the way you </v>

1066
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children down,</v>

1067
00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.880
<v Speaker 1>which is you explained to them as simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Clearly as you can,</v>

1068
00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:01.803
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening is happening while </v>

1069
00:48:02.621 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 1>you're making these decisions and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them some sense that they have some</v>

1070
00:48:07.061 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total control,</v>

1071
00:48:08.321 --> 00:48:10.660
<v Speaker 1>but some control over the decisions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making,</v>

1072
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and franchise.</v>

1073
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Then we bring them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a democracy,</v>

1074
00:48:13.541 --> 00:48:14.374
<v Speaker 1>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to mean the system is </v>

1075
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:18.130
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to say to people,</v>

1076
00:48:18.131 --> 00:48:18.964
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1077
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 1>you want x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>

1078
00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:20.974
<v Speaker 1>and z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will elected this guy to build a </v>

1079
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:24.370
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think a wall is stupid.</v>

1080
00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:25.204
<v Speaker 1>We don't think it's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think it's kind of embarrassing </v>

1081
00:48:26.141 --> 00:48:26.741
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

1082
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:29.170
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do it because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanded it.</v>

1083
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of give people a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the democRacy,</v>

1084
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they think it's fake,</v>

1085
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.520
<v Speaker 1>they think it's really an oligarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>posing as a democracy.</v>

1086
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to think about that.</v>

1087
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:43.090
<v Speaker 1>so just practice democracy a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would calm things down a lot.</v>

1088
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:44.763
<v Speaker 2>Is anyone doing it better than us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for all the sort of anger at each </v>

1089
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:49.650
<v Speaker 2>other right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because,</v>

1090
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spend time on twitter wheRe it seems </v>

1091
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:52.084
<v Speaker 2>like the civil war has begun already and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I get out there in real life and </v>

1092
00:48:54.851 --> 00:48:55.684
<v Speaker 2>I'm on this tour and it's like I need </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people all across the </v>

1093
00:48:58.421 --> 00:48:59.254
<v Speaker 2>middle of the country who are wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and open and decent and all those </v>

1094
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1095
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but I lost my question in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the point of that?</v>

1096
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it actually as bad as it seems and as</v>

1097
00:49:11.041 --> 00:49:12.930
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other country more stable,</v>

1098
00:49:12.931 --> 00:49:13.770
<v Speaker 1>unhappier than ours.</v>

1099
00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:14.690
<v Speaker 2>So that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.593
<v Speaker 2>Is there an example to look at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I see all these people always </v>

1101
00:49:18.971 --> 00:49:19.804
<v Speaker 2>complaining and as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easier to break things and burn </v>

1102
00:49:21.871 --> 00:49:24.550
<v Speaker 2>them down than it is to build.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all these people are always,</v>

1103
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at these countries.</v>

1104
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:26.583
<v Speaker 2>Look aT the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always look at the nordic </v>

1105
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:28.420
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be a big one.</v>

1106
00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden and you know,</v>

1107
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.780
<v Speaker 2>even though sweden's got all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems right now,</v>

1108
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:33.280
<v Speaker 2>you're one of the only people covering </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1109
00:49:33.281 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1110
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the only swedes on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

1111
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why you swedish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My name is carl said.</v>

1112
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1113
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.220
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot of ikea.</v>

1114
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in any meaningful sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedish.</v>

1115
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.813
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I am genetically swedish stuff </v>

1116
00:49:47.311 --> 00:49:49.040
<v Speaker 1>like even care about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1117
00:49:49.041 --> 00:49:50.010
<v Speaker 1>1000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24.</v>

1118
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:57.450
<v Speaker 1>But those are not models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can replicate for obvious reasons.</v>

1119
00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a country of Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden's got 8 million people go tell me</v>

1120
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:01.883
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1121
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:03.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who does it?</v>

1122
00:50:03.811 --> 00:50:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody does it better.</v>

1123
00:50:05.941 --> 00:50:08.610
<v Speaker 1>There's no greater country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a foreign passport.</v>

1124
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.473
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I plan to do everything I can for the </v>

1125
00:50:11.731 --> 00:50:12.564
<v Speaker 1>country because I have a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in it and I don't want to move </v>

1126
00:50:15.421 --> 00:50:16.470
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of anywhere.</v>

1127
00:50:16.471 --> 00:50:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Better helpline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland is pretty nice,</v>

1128
00:50:18.481 --> 00:50:20.730
<v Speaker 1>but there's no humor allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I probably the anyway,</v>

1129
00:50:20.731 --> 00:50:22.190
<v Speaker 1>the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1130
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:23.163
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look at countries and see their </v>

1131
00:50:25.381 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 1>ruling classes doing things you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours did.</v>

1132
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.610
<v Speaker 1>There's no country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of despise more than China.</v>

1133
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:32.833
<v Speaker 1>But one thing I do admire about China is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that its ruling clique a thinks long </v>

1134
00:50:39.791 --> 00:50:43.520
<v Speaker 1>term about stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their overriding concern.</v>

1135
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:44.354
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1136
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 1>that's rooted in their desire to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto power,</v>

1137
00:50:46.521 --> 00:50:48.170
<v Speaker 1>which is ignorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1138
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.393
<v Speaker 1>But they understand how important </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuity and stability are to the </v>

1139
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:55.040
<v Speaker 1>site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they think deeply and they don't make</v>

1140
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:55.874
<v Speaker 1>the right decisions all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the one child policy is a </v>

1141
00:50:57.861 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 1>disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

1142
00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.760
<v Speaker 1>that's how they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wish we thought that way.</v>

1143
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:02.803
<v Speaker 1>I think we've to internalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian economics as a model for </v>

1144
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:10.880
<v Speaker 1>everything that like it's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtuous to destroy this thing and build</v>

1145
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:13.520
<v Speaker 1>something new and we don't understand is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's not.</v>

1146
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.413
<v Speaker 1>People are not capable of that at scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 325 million people can't deal with </v>

1147
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 1>tearing down in remaking the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every generation.</v>

1148
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:23.180
<v Speaker 1>They just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go crazy.</v>

1149
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.673
<v Speaker 1>And so we need to identify the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we want to preserve and actively </v>

1150
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:30.060
<v Speaker 1>work to preserve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1151
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 1>and I would start with the bill of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

1152
00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:32.430
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1153
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:33.263
<v Speaker 2>I think any of the people right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these beautiful character caricature is </v>

1154
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.720
<v Speaker 2>maxine waters and mitch mcconnell and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nancy pelosi.</v>

1155
00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Who else do we have on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm upside down.</v>

1156
00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Hillary clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill crystal,</v>

1157
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.500
<v Speaker 2>crystal river bayzos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's this?</v>

1158
00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm upside down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's lindsey.</v>

1159
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Lindsey graham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well,</v>

1160
00:51:49.471 --> 00:51:50.304
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I actually wanted to sort of get </v>

1161
00:51:50.971 --> 00:51:51.804
<v Speaker 2>lindsey into this somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a little punchier there than in </v>

1162
00:51:53.971 --> 00:51:55.170
<v Speaker 2>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1163
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:56.063
<v Speaker 2>he's become sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a star said like what do you make </v>

1164
00:51:59.371 --> 00:52:02.700
<v Speaker 2>of sort of these republicans that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>even mitch mcconnEll,</v>

1165
00:52:02.701 --> 00:52:05.510
<v Speaker 2>like they seem like they've got a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>juice at the moment.</v>

1166
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like the cabinet thing did </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1167
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did the right thing and they're on </v>

1168
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:10.184
<v Speaker 1>the cover of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because of that or any real </v>

1169
00:52:13.101 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 1>political reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly lindSey graham is there and</v>

1170
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:18.740
<v Speaker 1>it's described inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the embodiment.</v>

1171
00:52:18.741 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 1>And I like lindsey graham and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's smart,</v>

1172
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 1>but he's the embodiment of a phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is really destructive,</v>

1173
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:28.871
<v Speaker 1>which is the refusal of people to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the failures that they created.</v>

1174
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:34.490
<v Speaker 1>And so like it's okay to have supported </v>
<v Speaker 1>the invasion of Iraq.</v>

1175
00:52:34.491 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's not okay is to seven,</v>

1176
00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.110
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years later,</v>

1177
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 1>look at it and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1178
00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:42.650
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no,</v>

1179
00:52:42.651 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to learn from what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

1180
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I think we should do it again like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something for which you should be</v>

1181
00:52:49.011 --> 00:52:50.600
<v Speaker 1>held responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my only point.</v>

1182
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like I catch my kid's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>

1183
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised that they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong,</v>

1184
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:55.573
<v Speaker 1>but I demand that they can see they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong and I make them try and </v>

1185
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:01.460
<v Speaker 1>learn from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just basic.</v>

1186
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:03.800
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's do a.</v>

1187
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.693
<v Speaker 2>I know there's nothing that people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>television like doing more than </v>

1188
00:53:06.741 --> 00:53:10.190
<v Speaker 2>predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got an election coming on,</v>

1189
00:53:10.191 --> 00:53:12.220
<v Speaker 2>like accountability is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1190
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.450
<v Speaker 2>So you seem pretty open to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1191
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:14.961
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1192
00:53:14.961 --> 00:53:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Glenn Beck on last week.</v>

1193
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:18.560
<v Speaker 2>How was he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was great.</v>

1194
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 2>He was [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a guy who,</v>

1195
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:21.840
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't sat down with them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you.</v>

1196
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:22.401
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1197
00:53:22.401 --> 00:53:26.550
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a guy who admits freely now</v>

1198
00:53:26.551 --> 00:53:27.384
<v Speaker 2>that he was part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was one of the people that led </v>

1199
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 2>to the polarization and he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix it.</v>

1200
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1201
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:36.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will say,</v>

1202
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:36.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his motives,</v>

1203
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 2>he Just wants whatever money it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people's.</v>

1204
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to attack people.</v>

1205
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:43.044
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you repeatedly show me that your </v>

1206
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:44.934
<v Speaker 2>motives are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I see a guy who genuinely </v>

1207
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.100
<v Speaker 2>ingredients trying to fix some things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1208
00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:52.140
<v Speaker 2>so when I discussed this with him about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the midterms,</v>

1209
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:53.303
<v Speaker 2>we sort of agreed basically that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only option that I see that is remotely </v>

1210
00:53:56.341 --> 00:53:59.610
<v Speaker 2>possible here for the betterment of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country going forward,</v>

1211
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:04.230
<v Speaker 2>the democrats kind of have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed so that they can rebuild.</v>

1212
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I don'T otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they do well in these midterms,</v>

1213
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 2>we ended up in two years of impeachment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like that,</v>

1214
00:54:10.861 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 2>that revolution thing that you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're on the brink of.</v>

1215
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.753
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is not because trump is </v>

1216
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:25.090
<v Speaker 1>inconvenienced or in peachtree or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the reason is that the problems</v>

1217
00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.810
<v Speaker 1>that led to trump's ascent are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unaddressed.</v>

1218
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1219
00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.100
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1220
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dying of the middleclass is the core</v>

1221
00:54:32.771 --> 00:54:35.890
<v Speaker 1>problem and no one is talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And trump,</v>

1222
00:54:35.891 --> 00:54:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I have to say sometimes makes it easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to talk about it because he seeks to</v>

1223
00:54:40.331 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 1>be the person people talk about anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1224
00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.810
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1225
00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:44.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1226
00:54:44.351 --> 00:54:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I think the ideas need to be repudiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>really clearly.</v>

1227
00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:52.651
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't win when you say that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty have an obligation to prove their</v>

1228
00:54:52.661 --> 00:54:53.680
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1229
00:54:53.681 --> 00:54:54.910
<v Speaker 1>We're not rewarding that.</v>

1230
00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

1231
00:54:56.411 --> 00:54:57.244
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate like sort of just obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>way this all was going to go like </v>

1232
00:55:00.791 --> 00:55:03.230
<v Speaker 2>everything with identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and everything else and believe</v>

1233
00:55:03.231 --> 00:55:05.590
<v Speaker 2>all women or because when you group </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

1234
00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:06.424
<v Speaker 2>you can't have anybody that wanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the cabinet thing really was kind of </v>

1235
00:55:10.751 --> 00:55:12.670
<v Speaker 2>the like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it seem obvious to you?</v>

1236
00:55:12.671 --> 00:55:14.590
<v Speaker 2>It seemed obvious to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it felt like.</v>

1237
00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:15.723
<v Speaker 2>The way the reaction</v>

1238
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.770
<v Speaker 1>are really obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

1239
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I got caught up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1240
00:55:20.241 --> 00:55:21.074
<v Speaker 1>I say it's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also got caught up as I always do </v>

1241
00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:25.160
<v Speaker 1>in my sort of literal like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait a second,</v>

1242
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.023
<v Speaker 1>what about ted kennedy or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I should have been far more </v>

1243
00:55:28.011 --> 00:55:28.870
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

1244
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:29.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you just said,</v>

1245
00:55:29.931 --> 00:55:32.330
<v Speaker 1>which is of course they're doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have to do it.</v>

1246
00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And this is kind of the logical apogee </v>
<v Speaker 1>of identity politics anyway,</v>

1247
00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:39.163
<v Speaker 1>that no one is really human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all just sort of component parts </v>

1248
00:55:43.161 --> 00:55:43.994
<v Speaker 1>of a larger whole of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have to act as a member of a </v>

1249
00:55:47.541 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 1>group that can never act alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1250
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:51.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1251
00:55:51.201 --> 00:55:53.630
<v Speaker 1>our unique humanity cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged.</v>

1252
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must,</v>

1253
00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:55.663
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1254
00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you must deal with this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1255
00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like straight white men,</v>

1256
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.041
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:02.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm acting according to type,</v>

1258
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.010
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1259
00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:05.900
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm talking about.</v>

1260
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.260
<v Speaker 1>It's yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I should have known that of course.</v>

1261
00:56:09.261 --> 00:56:10.094
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that most people buy that </v>

1262
00:56:12.861 --> 00:56:13.694
<v Speaker 1>or want to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to live in that country </v>

1263
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:19.070
<v Speaker 1>where you're required by your dna to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain way.</v>

1264
00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:21.140
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what makes you different from a robot</v>

1265
00:56:21.141 --> 00:56:21.920
<v Speaker 1>at that point?</v>

1266
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 2>And these are the exact people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>now defending Elizabeth Warren,</v>

1267
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:28.020
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could not be more fraudulent in which.</v>

1268
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Have you had any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HAve you had a native american tribes?</v>

1269
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Men are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1270
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have to say I think that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me has been a happy respite from all</v>

1271
00:56:38.271 --> 00:56:40.160
<v Speaker 1>this heavy stuff because it's just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

1272
00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did for Joseph Smith is warren is.</v>

1273
00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.530
<v Speaker 1>But I do think there's a deep question </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of it.</v>

1274
00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Not even at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very top of it,</v>

1275
00:56:47.121 --> 00:56:50.510
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should your dna determine your life?</v>

1276
00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I'm just too american or too </v>
<v Speaker 1>California or something,</v>

1277
00:56:53.391 --> 00:56:54.800
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it should.</v>

1278
00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what people you never met.</v>

1279
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I think you're responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that you make.</v>

1280
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we Should hurt you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your eye color or your height or your</v>

1281
00:57:03.801 --> 00:57:05.500
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like if,</v>

1282
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:06.463
<v Speaker 1>if you start to accept that it's okay to</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflict group punishment on groups then </v>

1283
00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:15.764
<v Speaker 1>like I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the whole lesson of the 20th </v>

1284
00:57:17.631 --> 00:57:21.020
<v Speaker 1>century that that's wrong and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culdesac that ends in bloodshed.</v>

1285
00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:21.853
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why are we accepting this and </v>

1286
00:57:24.081 --> 00:57:26.280
<v Speaker 1>everyday on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main pros,</v>

1287
00:57:26.281 --> 00:57:27.114
<v Speaker 1>last thing I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the main problems with our </v>

1288
00:57:28.251 --> 00:57:29.084
<v Speaker 1>coverage is that as brought to us by </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb people and I really think finance </v>

1289
00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.380
<v Speaker 1>the whole finance world is partly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>blame.</v>

1290
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:37.243
<v Speaker 1>Forty years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like smart evan thomas from newsweek </v>

1291
00:57:39.621 --> 00:57:41.400
<v Speaker 1>lives used to live on my street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been.</v>

1292
00:57:41.401 --> 00:57:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Tom is a very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to harvard,</v>

1293
00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:44.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of liberal,</v>

1294
00:57:44.841 --> 00:57:47.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's in legitimately smart,</v>

1295
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:48.853
<v Speaker 1>smarter than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left harvard and went to work at </v>

1296
00:57:50.661 --> 00:57:53.810
<v Speaker 1>newsweek because that was kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable path.</v>

1297
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Now what percentage of harvard seniors </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to newsweek now?</v>

1298
00:57:58.191 --> 00:58:00.850
<v Speaker 1>They're going into private equity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're Left with,</v>

1299
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:01.803
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like medieval england where </v>

1300
00:58:03.181 --> 00:58:03.471
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1301
00:58:03.471 --> 00:58:04.304
<v Speaker 1>under private jennifer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first son gets the estate and the </v>

1302
00:58:06.231 --> 00:58:08.810
<v Speaker 1>second son has to like figure it out or </v>
<v Speaker 1>become an army officer,</v>

1303
00:58:08.811 --> 00:58:09.644
<v Speaker 1>a vicar or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're getting the dumb people </v>

1304
00:58:12.261 --> 00:58:13.094
<v Speaker 1>were getting the people who can't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>for themselves or all of a sudden </v>

1305
00:58:15.771 --> 00:58:17.540
<v Speaker 1>winding up as cable news anchors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1306
00:58:17.541 --> 00:58:19.490
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1307
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.753
<v Speaker 2>I do know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm on youtube with all the </v>

1308
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:27.150
<v Speaker 2>smart people have youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1309
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.111
<v Speaker 2>Listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1310
00:58:28.111 --> 00:58:28.944
<v Speaker 2>the first video that I did in uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2018 was that I thought this was </v>

1311
00:58:31.951 --> 00:58:33.930
<v Speaker 2>going to be the year of unusual </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliances.</v>

1312
00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:36.840
<v Speaker 2>And I would say I would say this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>right up there because I,</v>

1313
00:58:36.841 --> 00:58:37.674
<v Speaker 2>I consider this a great alliance and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you're doing great work and all </v>

1314
00:58:40.171 --> 00:58:41.004
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that you need</v>

1315
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.780
<v Speaker 1>any body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's really simple.</v>

1316
00:58:43.781 --> 00:58:48.250
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you feel a moral obligation to scream</v>

1317
00:58:48.251 --> 00:58:49.084
<v Speaker 1>at people in restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you disagree with their political </v>

1318
00:58:50.831 --> 00:58:52.510
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not on my side.</v>

1319
00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:55.450
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are so it's like,</v>

1320
00:58:55.451 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is such an intense moment.</v>

1321
00:58:58.451 --> 00:58:59.860
<v Speaker 1>It's thrown everything into stark </v>
<v Speaker 1>relief.</v>

1322
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I just care about aligning myself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who believe in the individual and</v>

1323
00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>

1324
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I hear you brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for more on tucker,</v>

1325
00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:12.420

<v Speaker 2>tucker carlson tonight at 8:00</v>

1326
00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:13.560
