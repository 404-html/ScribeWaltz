00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>For those of you keeping score at home </v>
<v Speaker 1>last week was one for the Rubin report.</v>

2
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Record books are week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started off by interviewing Senator John</v>

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.801
<v Speaker 1>Mccain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war hero,</v>

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the longest serving members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress,</v>

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>and a Republican nominee for president </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the United States,</v>

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Senator Mccain and I had a frank </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion on this year's election,</v>

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.603
<v Speaker 1>money and politics and foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What struck me more than anything while </v>

8
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:24.834
<v Speaker 1>talking to the senator was whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree or disagree with his political </v>

9
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:28.644
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clear that he's really trying to </v>

10
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>bridge the ideological divide and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he feels is right for the country.</v>

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>The entire time I was talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking,</v>

12
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>what a better candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senator mccain would be,</v>

13
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>the any of the current contenders in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gop rat race.</v>

14
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Immediately after interviewing Senator </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mccain,</v>

15
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.444
<v Speaker 1>I had the chance to interview loopnet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loopnet is a 23 year old engineering </v>

16
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>student and an atheist fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>secular values in her homeland of Iraq.</v>

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.083
<v Speaker 1>Simply by talking to me about secularism</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the confines of her clothes </v>

18
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:01.744
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She instantly became braver than pretty </v>

19
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:04.884
<v Speaker 1>much every person that I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm honored that she chose me as the </v>

20
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>first public person to talk to and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>always be an ally for her,</v>

21
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>whether she's in Iraq or wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life takes her while I was in awe of her</v>

22
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:16.314
<v Speaker 1>during the interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most impactful part to me was when </v>

23
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>we talked about some of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we both admire,</v>

24
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>including Sam Harris and Richard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins.</v>

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>This portion of our chat illuminated </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what this show is about.</v>

26
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Ideas the same ideas that Sam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard sparked in me.</v>

27
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>A 39 year old guy born in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in Los Angeles,</v>

28
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>also were sparked in Louisiana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 23 year old atheist in Iraq.</v>

29
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>This shows you the true power of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good or bad.</v>

30
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Ideas can transcend nationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

31
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:46.524
<v Speaker 1>or religion.</v>

32
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>My final interview last week was with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the former leader of the English defense</v>

33
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>league and now outspoken anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration activist,</v>

34
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:54.834
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Robinson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned at the top of the show </v>

35
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:57.384
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hesitant to even talk to Tommy </v>

36
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>because people might call me a bigot or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a racist.</v>

37
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Not only my glad that we did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>

38
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really proud of your reaction to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

39
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>whether on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

40
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>or facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys all kept the conversation going</v>

41
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.114
<v Speaker 1>after Tommy and I put it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was complete and total confirmation </v>

42
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.434
<v Speaker 1>of last week's direct message being </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to talk and no longer be part of </v>

43
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt there is a real movement</v>

44
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:24.804
<v Speaker 1>happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are absolutely sick of being </v>

45
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:27.954
<v Speaker 1>divided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conversation is the key to bringing us </v>

46
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why in one week I talked to a</v>

47
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>man who was almost the leader of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>free world,</v>

48
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.083
<v Speaker 1>a woman who puts her life on the line to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what she believes and another man </v>

49
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>who is on a crusade of his own.</v>

50
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>It's totally irrelevant whether I agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with everything my guest say.</v>

51
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>The important thing is to not be afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear them.</v>

52
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>As the Internet brings us all closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

53
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>we find ourselves connected with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that we could've only dreamt of</v>

54
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>a couple years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite that connection,</v>

55
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:56.964
<v Speaker 1>I still get messages from you or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining that sometimes you guys are </v>

56
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.304
<v Speaker 1>afraid to say certain things to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends in real life or to post certain </v>

57
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.144
<v Speaker 1>articles on facebook for all to see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>lube a 23 year old in Iraq isn't afraid </v>

58
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>to speak up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you guys can't be either.</v>

59
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>There is no time for silence anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.413
<v Speaker 1>there are genuinely bad people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and sometimes talking to them </v>

61
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>won't get you the results you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

62
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>you have to be brave enough to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation in the first place.</v>

63
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.623
<v Speaker 1>Don't let louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Voices with worst intentions drown you </v>

64
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

65
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:31.774
<v Speaker 1>According to Wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my guest this week is either the former </v>

66
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:35.404
<v Speaker 1>king of Mesopotamia or youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not afraid to speak his mind on </v>

67
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>controversial topics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

68
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:41.734
<v Speaker 1>I have Carl Benjamin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better known as Sargon of a cod on the </v>

69
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Sargon.</v>

70
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.643
<v Speaker 1>What do I call you?</v>

71
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Whichever you once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get cold both all day long.</v>

72
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:52.640
<v Speaker 2>So whichever one you're comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

73
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Sargon has sort of overtaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl.</v>

74
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.850
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of a Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Wayne situation here.</v>

75
00:03:58.851 --> 00:03:59.684
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

76
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of is actually.</v>

77
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:02.364
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the name song on his definitely </v>

78
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.790
<v Speaker 2>traveled before me in many places where </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressives,</v>

79
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 2>a tense congregates</v>

80
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>aggressives I'm shocked that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>say regressives,</v>

81
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get to that momentarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

82
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:20.464
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get into all the deep stuff </v>

83
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the topics and the meat of this,</v>

84
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:24.634
<v Speaker 1>I want people to get to know you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit because I think it's sort of </v>

85
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>just recently that you're showing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>face more.</v>

86
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:31.204
<v Speaker 1>You're out there more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your name's getting out there a little </v>

87
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did Carl Benjamin Becomes Argon?</v>

88
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:38.134
<v Speaker 1>Have a guide.</v>

89
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.193
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

90
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.430
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting story.</v>

91
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not actually that interesting as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

92
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>That will just make it interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

93
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try and I'll try and fabricates let</v>

94
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.720
<v Speaker 2>me know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically about.</v>

95
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.270
<v Speaker 2>So about two and a half years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you when you know,</v>

96
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 2>when you're on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ended up just choosing a Monica that</v>

97
00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:58.014
<v Speaker 2>you sign into places with and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to like the historical figure </v>

98
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:03.240
<v Speaker 2>of song and he was an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure.</v>

99
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I like the sound of the name and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

100
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.013
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just using that and I had signed </v>

101
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:08.754
<v Speaker 2>up to youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in 2010 just to upload some videos </v>

102
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 2>of myself with an ancient sling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:14.814
<v Speaker 2>the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.093
<v Speaker 2>I made one call the historical sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>documents and I tested it out and it's </v>

105
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.210
<v Speaker 2>that you can see why they're dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons or thing.</v>

106
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.240
<v Speaker 2>And then a few days later I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically getting really,</v>

107
00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:28.074
<v Speaker 2>really worried about lead the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political climate in the left eye was </v>

108
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.130
<v Speaker 2>starting to see more and more often I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just my,</v>

109
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.070
<v Speaker 2>my own principles being completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>violated.</v>

110
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 2>And it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

111
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 2>really worried and it was thing that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely started ignoring me because,</v>

112
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.403
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would see people arguing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguing against people's freedom of </v>

113
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:50.850
<v Speaker 2>speech or they would be arguing against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the socratic system.</v>

114
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 2>So some Lama and everyone would seem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be going along with it this,</v>

115
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.910
<v Speaker 2>this was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.910
<v Speaker 2>there was so many people going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

117
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.420
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly how we should do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

118
00:05:58.421 --> 00:05:59.254
<v Speaker 2>those Palak thinking course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally disagree and I disagree on </v>

119
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.494
<v Speaker 2>such a fundamental level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say something and so I found </v>

120
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:07.184
<v Speaker 2>myself just motivated sort of right </v>
<v Speaker 2>around just like under five minute </v>

121
00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 2>scripts or something and then read them </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a very,</v>

122
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>very bad microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about the mic.</v>

123
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.550
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

124
00:06:18.551 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a magician's trick on this,</v>

125
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 2>but I have just the cheap on microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really,</v>

126
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 2>really terrible quality and I'd read </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas and they started gaining.</v>

127
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Some teams have started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People started subscribing to my channel</v>

128
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>and stuff and looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm thinking,</v>

129
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:32.391
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were really.</v>

130
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:33.224
<v Speaker 2>That was a little full bearings there </v>
<v Speaker 2>about my technical skill and what I was </v>

131
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess some people agreed with what</v>

132
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:39.074
<v Speaker 2>was saying because now I've got um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just lost a quarter of a million </v>

133
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 2>subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

134
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I do this full time and it's a,</v>

135
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a wonderful thing to be doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting for my principals professional.</v>

136
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.110
<v Speaker 1>So I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that because as I say on the show</v>

137
00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:53.944
<v Speaker 1>every week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to do here is make this </v>

138
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:56.134
<v Speaker 1>about ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what you were talking </v>

139
00:06:58.421 --> 00:06:59.254
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were hearing bad ideas and then you </v>

140
00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:05.140
<v Speaker 1>want it to beat them with better ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and clearly it's working because you got</v>

141
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:07.150
<v Speaker 1>over 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers.</v>

142
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.203
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I had my personal awakening </v>

143
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:12.880
<v Speaker 1>because everyone knows at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I've always considered myself liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was in the progressive world,</v>

145
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 1>which I now see as some sort of mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

146
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was having my awakening out </v>

147
00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.630
<v Speaker 1>everyone online said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to talk to Sargon.</v>

149
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my,</v>

150
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.400
<v Speaker 1>so my first question to you before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the heavy stuff is,</v>

151
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:34.234
<v Speaker 1>did you study politics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What brought you into the political </v>

152
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:37.504
<v Speaker 1>realm?</v>

153
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

154
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just watching the news I guess,</v>

155
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.310
<v Speaker 2>and just watching you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>popular.</v>

156
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:42.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

157
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:43.814
<v Speaker 2>I used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a big fan of the young </v>

158
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Turks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

159
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I used to consider myself progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>until I met progressive's.</v>

160
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.883
<v Speaker 2>And like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe the things they were </v>

161
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:53.284
<v Speaker 2>saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really struck me as some sort of </v>

162
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 2>mental disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

163
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Why would they start saying things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and.</v>

164
00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I,</v>

165
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:00.280
<v Speaker 2>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

166
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.113
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still find myself floundering on my </v>

167
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:04.030
<v Speaker 2>own because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

169
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.593
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a conservative and I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't bring myself to subscribe to </v>

170
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:10.010
<v Speaker 2>conservative ideals and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

171
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.230
<v Speaker 2>They didn't work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

172
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

173
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 2>and so I was basically on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.330
<v Speaker 2>everyone I knew was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a liberal,</v>

175
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.930
<v Speaker 2>was quite happy to ignore the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundational principles of liberalism in</v>

176
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:26.710
<v Speaker 2>order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to push progressivism,</v>

177
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 2>furthering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more I,</v>

178
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.680
<v Speaker 2>the more I've learned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressivism,</v>

179
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:30.514
<v Speaker 2>the more I realize it's really used </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism as a Trojan horse to they've </v>

180
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.531
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

181
00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:38.200
<v Speaker 2>we liberals or progressives and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

182
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.213
<v Speaker 2>on the subsequent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not necessarily our group for </v>

183
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.940
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really the methods,</v>

184
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:45.490
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily the goals.</v>

185
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

186
00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:47.491
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

187
00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:48.324
<v Speaker 2>they heavily use the terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>interchangeably and they are not </v>

188
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 2>interchangeable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

189
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

190
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.603
<v Speaker 1>let's unpack that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've heard you say you refer to </v>

191
00:08:55.711 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a classic liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more that I've been doing this,</v>

192
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really where I feel at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home too.</v>

193
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I think now I have some really strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian leanings also,</v>

194
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

195
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>there's some play there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some common ground there.</v>

196
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>But what is classic liberalism mean to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

197
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's just the instance,</v>

198
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.440
<v Speaker 2>the basic values that came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alignment,</v>

199
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.690
<v Speaker 2>the civil liberties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political freedom,</v>

200
00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:22.370
<v Speaker 2>freedom of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of association,</v>

201
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Economic Freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>representative democracy,</v>

202
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:26.330
<v Speaker 2>the rule of law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always just,</v>

203
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.880
<v Speaker 2>there is no argument against these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

204
00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:31.220
<v Speaker 2>These are great ideas that universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

205
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is protected under these ideas.</v>

206
00:09:33.981 --> 00:09:34.814
<v Speaker 2>Unlike with progressivism web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing they will do is </v>

207
00:09:37.971 --> 00:09:40.520
<v Speaker 2>demarcates a group and they will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right women,</v>

208
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.020
<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people,</v>

209
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.093
<v Speaker 2>these people need special treatment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>special treatment will involve the </v>

210
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:46.814
<v Speaker 2>infringement of your personal rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is where I have a problem </v>

211
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:52.790
<v Speaker 2>because if we all ascribe to these same </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

212
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all being treated as equals B,</v>

213
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 2>nobody ends up losing their rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't have a point seat.</v>

214
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've covered the reasons.</v>

215
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

216
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.670
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is sort of a,</v>

217
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.910
<v Speaker 1>an example of the road to hell is paved </v>
<v Speaker 1>with good intentions,</v>

218
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:10.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is where I've seen,</v>

219
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of progressives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them won't talk to me anymore.</v>

220
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.310
<v Speaker 1>People that I that were my good friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>only,</v>

221
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:16.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

222
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:18.620
<v Speaker 1>eight months ago that won't talk to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

223
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:19.663
<v Speaker 1>But I believe that for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to get into some of the </v>

224
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>really dangerous ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think for the most part,</v>

225
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.330
<v Speaker 1>people that consider themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive,</v>

226
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.193
<v Speaker 1>most of the people that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders rallies I think are good </v>

227
00:10:29.511 --> 00:10:31.550
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think their intentions are correct.</v>

228
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.280
<v Speaker 1>So we're really talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodology here,</v>

229
00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:35.114
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

230
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

231
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a few.</v>

232
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.083
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you have a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a bunch of motivating factors </v>

233
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 2>that kind of coalesce and in mixed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>

234
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:51.801
<v Speaker 2>you have the more sort of a punisher </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of people who can see where this</v>

235
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:54.594
<v Speaker 2>is going because a lot of it involves </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving the benefit of the doubts so </v>

236
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 2>people who you would otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily be skeptical to.</v>

237
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.170
<v Speaker 2>People making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

238
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.270
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape laws,</v>

239
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.680
<v Speaker 2>one of the big progressive pushes and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

240
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.040
<v Speaker 2>is to have it so the victim quotes </v>
<v Speaker 2>unquotes,</v>

241
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.203
<v Speaker 2>the alleged victim is believed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore the burden of proof becomes </v>

242
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.433
<v Speaker 2>lead on the person who's being accused </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than on the accuser and they do </v>

243
00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:22.440
<v Speaker 2>this by the use of statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

244
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.041
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

245
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:24.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the numbers,</v>

246
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.553
<v Speaker 2>but something like under five percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>accused rapist go to jail or something </v>

247
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:29.484
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and therefore they assume that there is </v>

248
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 2>a massive problem with the system.</v>

249
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.413
<v Speaker 2>That 95 percent of accused rapist also </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual rapists and therefore just being </v>

250
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 2>let off through a bad system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

251
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:41.643
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>

252
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:42.563
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea how many of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are accused are actually legitimate </v>

253
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:49.300
<v Speaker 2>rapists and deserve to be condemned for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and convicted for,</v>

254
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.753
<v Speaker 2>but secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing that is reversing the </v>

255
00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.244
<v Speaker 2>system because at the moment what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have as a system that isn't perfect but </v>

256
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.400
<v Speaker 2>can deliver justice in a reliable way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.513
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can be quite sure that the people </v>

258
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 2>going to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably aunt innocent,</v>

259
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been through a rigorous rigorous </v>

260
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:07.210
<v Speaker 2>trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The burden of proof is on the accuser.</v>

261
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.073
<v Speaker 2>They've managed to prove beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable doubt and you know that's </v>

262
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:11.494
<v Speaker 2>fine because that way you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the minimum number of people who </v>

263
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:15.094
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being punished as if they did something </v>

264
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

265
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.273
<v Speaker 2>Whereas to flip the script on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would mean that you now have a </v>

266
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 2>system that is inherently unjust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might be able to deliver justice on</v>

267
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.044
<v Speaker 2>occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The occasion being the person being </v>

268
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:28.864
<v Speaker 2>accused is on camera somewhere else at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time that they're supposed to have </v>

269
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:32.950
<v Speaker 2>been doing the rape or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

270
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not sort of thing.</v>

271
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be incidental justice.</v>

272
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.893
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't rely on it because you </v>

273
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 2>don't presume the innocence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people being accused that guilt is being</v>

274
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 2>presumed and it's being done like say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

275
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 2>good motives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that,</v>

276
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

277
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to cool the victims lies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

278
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:50.134
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to call the victim a liar </v>

279
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:51.664
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of those points where </v>

280
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 2>you're on the horns of a dilemma and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have no choice but to take a responsible</v>

281
00:12:57.011 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 2>course of action for safety of someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who hasn't done anything wrong.</v>

282
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

283
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>

284
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:07.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot there that I want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been preparing for this.</v>

285
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

286
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.411
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

287
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:09.244
<v Speaker 1>you're jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're though I knew that that's how </v>

288
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 1>this conversation was going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's so much to talk about.</v>

289
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.670
<v Speaker 1>And then these things are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>inextricably linked.</v>

290
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.533
<v Speaker 1>That's what I found whenever I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about anything related to sort of </v>

291
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:20.614
<v Speaker 1>regressive ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you start talking about </v>

292
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 1>feminism and Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam and all these things,</v>

293
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

294
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 1>they're all so inextricable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inextricably linked.</v>

295
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

296
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:31.744
<v Speaker 1>let's jump into Gamergate for a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll get back to some of that </v>

297
00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 1>stuff because Gamergate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is one of the things that really</v>

298
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:42.180
<v Speaker 1>sort of put you on the map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even by saying the word Gamergate,</v>

299
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I've made people crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know this now.</v>

300
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I've discussed it with a couple people </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had Milo Yiannopoulos on.</v>

301
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about it with Christina Hoff</v>
<v Speaker 1>summers.</v>

302
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

303
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.540
<v Speaker 1>you are a true Gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

304
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am indeed a true Gamer.</v>

305
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 1>What are you playing these days?</v>

306
00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I play a game called oxygen level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>volt.</v>

307
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

308
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.053
<v Speaker 2>I actually have my own server where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay for a sub or I get to run around </v>

309
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:05.480
<v Speaker 2>killing the tool dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

310
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.533
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you for taking a moment from </v>

311
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:10.440
<v Speaker 1>slaying dinosaurs to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to join me here.</v>

312
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

313
00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:14.730
<v Speaker 1>you've really been in the Gamergate </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and I think are considered sort of</v>

314
00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:16.890
<v Speaker 1>an expert on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you give me like a two,</v>

315
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:20.160
<v Speaker 1>three minute explanation of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gamergate is?</v>

316
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:20.994
<v Speaker 1>And I know that's almost impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like it's something </v>

317
00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:25.920
<v Speaker 1>different to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

318
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.500
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you my version of what it is,</v>

319
00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:30.300
<v Speaker 2>but like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is different for everybody and you're</v>

320
00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 2>going to get people who are going to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what Gamergate,</v>

321
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.930
<v Speaker 2>his and one not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

322
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it is,</v>

323
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.273
<v Speaker 2>it's a very definite reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>regressives infiltrating the video game </v>

324
00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:45.540
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is something that we saw.</v>

325
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.210
<v Speaker 2>We've still happening over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 2>about five years where they were just in</v>

326
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.073
<v Speaker 2>criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>larger and larger numbers of them would </v>

327
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:53.984
<v Speaker 2>be hired at various gaming publications </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they would start writing </v>

328
00:14:57.111 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 2>articles like all these video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist.</v>

329
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Why are these video games was soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no Trans People Nisa d games.</v>

330
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 2>This is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

331
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

332
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 2>the standard regressive lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

333
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:10.004
<v Speaker 2>And they would be promoting very famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist like Anita Sarkeesian or when </v>

334
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.920
<v Speaker 2>people with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>

335
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to sound mean,</v>

336
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:21.420
<v Speaker 2>but very few real credentials in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>video game industry mean like Zoe Quinn.</v>

337
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 2>When the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

338
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:24.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Franz Ferdinand of game of gates,</v>

339
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she made a,</v>

340
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.980
<v Speaker 2>a free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

341
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.323
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever have those choose your own </v>

342
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:31.380
<v Speaker 2>adventure book?</v>

343
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose your own adventure.</v>

344
00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I probably had everyone likes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

345
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

346
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically that's what she had made.</v>

347
00:15:37.321 --> 00:15:39.360
<v Speaker 2>She had made a digital tutors rent </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure book.</v>

348
00:15:39.361 --> 00:15:41.400
<v Speaker 2>It was all old tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

349
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing else in it.</v>

350
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:44.963
<v Speaker 2>It can take him very long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was about learning to deal with </v>

351
00:15:46.621 --> 00:15:47.454
<v Speaker 2>depression and I've never had depression</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I can't judge the game on that </v>

352
00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:51.280
<v Speaker 2>metric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on that.</v>

353
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.123
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your average game of this wasn't </v>

354
00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:55.740
<v Speaker 2>really a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a fail state,</v>

355
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:56.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

356
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.430
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't really into complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more like an interactive Nova,</v>

357
00:15:59.431 --> 00:16:01.140
<v Speaker 2>which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in itself is fine,</v>

358
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.490
<v Speaker 2>but the gaming press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was a prominent feminist and</v>

359
00:16:05.491 --> 00:16:09.240
<v Speaker 2>regressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got unbelievable amounts of coverage</v>

360
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.400
<v Speaker 2>and I mean when I say unbelievable me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any amounts of coverage,</v>

361
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.243
<v Speaker 2>but it's more than you would expect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people were kind of getting sick </v>

362
00:16:17.161 --> 00:16:18.480
<v Speaker 2>of the agenda being pushed on them.</v>

363
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same as it needs to appease</v>
<v Speaker 2>him when he'd suck easy in.</v>

364
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Did a kickstarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was everywhere.</v>

365
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.413
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knew about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet everyone also knew that the </v>

366
00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:31.110
<v Speaker 2>argument that she was presenting where </v>
<v Speaker 2>half truths they would cherry pick,</v>

367
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.973
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was finding individually examples </v>

368
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.970
<v Speaker 2>that didn't really represent the gaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry or any evil,</v>

369
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsections of the gaming industry.</v>

370
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.023
<v Speaker 2>I'm presenting them as if they were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>categoric statement on the condition of </v>

371
00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:42.984
<v Speaker 2>the entire gaming industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so everyone was really kind of </v>

372
00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:45.714
<v Speaker 2>annoyed by this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially as the way that these people </v>

373
00:16:48.391 --> 00:16:49.224
<v Speaker 2>work is by running a pure emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So almost everything they say is </v>

374
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.680
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally accusatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would say things like,</v>

375
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.960
<v Speaker 2>you're a sexist or a racist if you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>these games.</v>

376
00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.270
<v Speaker 2>There aren't enough black people in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

377
00:17:00.271 --> 00:17:02.520
<v Speaker 2>rotten of women in this game or gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or the sort of thing.</v>

378
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And if you're enjoying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bad person.</v>

379
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Whereas most people are thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

380
00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:08.664
<v Speaker 2>just how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just make the games you want to </v>

381
00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:10.404
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

382
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:11.603
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what these people are </v>

383
00:17:12.601 --> 00:17:13.434
<v Speaker 2>interested in whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it got to the point where that </v>

384
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.483
<v Speaker 2>Zoe Quinn was colts having an affair </v>
<v Speaker 2>with her boss who was involved in video </v>

385
00:17:22.711 --> 00:17:25.590
<v Speaker 2>games and also a journalist called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nathan Grayson.</v>

386
00:17:25.591 --> 00:17:29.400
<v Speaker 2>And the video game industries presses </v>
<v Speaker 2>always been corrupt.</v>

387
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean that it's always been cropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's come out of a hobby press.</v>

388
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.070
<v Speaker 2>It's always been really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>

389
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

390
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 1>so when you say corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to pause for one second,</v>

391
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:40.440
<v Speaker 1>when you say corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean things like,</v>

392
00:17:40.441 --> 00:17:41.274
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people paying off the magazine writers </v>

393
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.210
<v Speaker 1>so that they'd get better reviews on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

394
00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:46.650
<v Speaker 1>So they'd sell more games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

395
00:17:46.651 --> 00:17:47.910
<v Speaker 1>real corrupt stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a hold of it's in your face as well.</v>

397
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 2>So you go to a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a online magazine,</v>

398
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:53.603
<v Speaker 2>I'm the backdrop would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertisement for gate then would be </v>

399
00:17:56.581 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 2>reviewed in the sense of color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

400
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even trying to hide it,</v>

401
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:05.130
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part nobody really </v>
<v Speaker 2>cared because they weren't being preachy</v>

402
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:05.581
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to sell you video </v>
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

404
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:07.561
<v Speaker 2>I'm asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

405
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 2>people with death and that full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody was that bothered.</v>

406
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.853
<v Speaker 2>But then the regressives turned up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>started being corrupt in a whole </v>

407
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:17.700
<v Speaker 2>different way instead of instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being motivated by money,</v>

408
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:18.534
<v Speaker 2>which I suppose is to their credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were motivated by ideology and so </v>

409
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:22.164
<v Speaker 2>now they would hire people into </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions and promote things that were </v>

410
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.753
<v Speaker 2>all based on cronyism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all their friends and family </v>

411
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:30.390
<v Speaker 2>members and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would.</v>

412
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 2>They would push everything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>our agenda and people realistically,</v>

413
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Speaker 2>people have just been really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really sick.</v>

414
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Then just when they were tied to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

415
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 2>moralism tied to being told that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were bad people even though you didn't.</v>

416
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Obviously none of these people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually bad people,</v>

417
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:43.824
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows who all these people and </v>

418
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being,</v>

419
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.030
<v Speaker 2>they're being prejudged before anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

420
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 2>And they got to the point where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like looking at it enough,</v>

421
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has got to stop.</v>

422
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.373
<v Speaker 2>And that's what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically it was called the Quinn </v>

423
00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:59.640
<v Speaker 2>spirasi solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the video game press instead of</v>

424
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 2>turning around and saying something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

425
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.401
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>

426
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:04.470
<v Speaker 2>We haven't been doing our due diligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

427
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.343
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are professional trained </v>

428
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:08.620
<v Speaker 2>journalists like Steven that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>telephone Kentucky,</v>

429
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.700
<v Speaker 2>his master's degree in journalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's there saying,</v>

430
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:13.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we have to be objective?</v>

431
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:15.120
<v Speaker 2>What's the need for objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism?</v>

432
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 2>And so you can instantly see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems that were in the air and in the</v>

433
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:19.374
<v Speaker 2>video game industry.</v>

434
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know we can,</v>

435
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.130
<v Speaker 1>we can really go down the rabbit hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this and we could,</v>

436
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.030
<v Speaker 1>we could spend three hours with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's.</v>

437
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a nice little beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of it.</v>

438
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.293
<v Speaker 1>But what I really find fascinating about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and why I've brought it up several </v>

439
00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:34.550
<v Speaker 1>times is because the same things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>

440
00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:35.384
<v Speaker 1>how the regressive sort of infiltrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and turned something that had </v>

441
00:19:38.451 --> 00:19:43.451
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with sexism or racism or </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of these things.</v>

442
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.360
<v Speaker 1>They made it about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when I was on your show,</v>

443
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I was saying how I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:19:48.501 --> 00:19:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a huge gamer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that much anymore,</v>

445
00:19:50.751 --> 00:19:53.600
<v Speaker 1>but I liked the community and I do play </v>
<v Speaker 1>some games here and there.</v>

446
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:54.981
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:19:54.981 --> 00:19:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I played grand theft auto and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could steal a car and punch a hooker</v>

448
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's against women,</v>

449
00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:01.544
<v Speaker 1>but you could also punch your man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So should they only have it that you'd </v>

450
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.333
<v Speaker 1>only punch men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even the logic behind it doesn't </v>

451
00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:08.660
<v Speaker 1>really stand to critique</v>

452
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.770
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no winning ignorant.</v>

453
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 2>So the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all in the school.</v>

454
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.410
<v Speaker 2>It's either you are this thing or this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

455
00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:18.180
<v Speaker 2>you don't even realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

456
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 2>and there's no falsifiability is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypotheses.</v>

457
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

458
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 2>the main problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

459
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.550
<v Speaker 2>like with grand theft auto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what are the options?</v>

460
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Not include women in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No way they'd,</v>

461
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.020
<v Speaker 2>they'd freak out if you couldn't put </v>
<v Speaker 2>women in the game,</v>

462
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you can have the women not being able</v>

463
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:35.170
<v Speaker 2>to be treated like men again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be freaking out.</v>

464
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.510
<v Speaker 2>That's not equal at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I mean,</v>

465
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.353
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have women and suddenly </v>

466
00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:40.890
<v Speaker 2>it just can't be damaged or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

467
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:41.610
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

468
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 2>they will not allow you to treat women </v>
<v Speaker 2>like men.</v>

469
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:45.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't beat up women,</v>

470
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:47.040
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can be tough men.</v>

471
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.550
<v Speaker 2>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in this position where you've got</v>

472
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.433
<v Speaker 2>no when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's no good answer and </v>

473
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 2>that's how they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want you dancing to that team.</v>

474
00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>

475
00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:57.683
<v Speaker 1>that's what's so fascinating about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why I think it's so related to the </v>

476
00:21:00.091 --> 00:21:02.880
<v Speaker 1>political situation with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressives.</v>

477
00:21:02.881 --> 00:21:03.714
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that's why Gamergate </v>
<v Speaker 1>blew up the way it did because gamers </v>

478
00:21:06.721 --> 00:21:07.554
<v Speaker 1>generally are going to skew a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger than the people that are solely </v>

479
00:21:09.931 --> 00:21:12.660
<v Speaker 1>interested in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of that,</v>

480
00:21:12.661 --> 00:21:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it was this group of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had never been used to being attacked or</v>

481
00:21:17.221 --> 00:21:18.054
<v Speaker 1>silenced before and they were young and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were online and they were ready to </v>

482
00:21:21.991 --> 00:21:25.590
<v Speaker 1>coalesce around something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what made it so,</v>

483
00:21:25.591 --> 00:21:26.820
<v Speaker 1>so magical or something,</v>

484
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gamers,</v>

485
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.190
<v Speaker 2>gamers actually loan been the demon in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

486
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bedroom.</v>

487
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Then I felt like the American Christians</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late nineties,</v>

488
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:37.414
<v Speaker 2>early two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was Hillary Clinton under Joe </v>

489
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.853
<v Speaker 2>journeymen actually brought legislation </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try and try and sort of sense of </v>

490
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:45.544
<v Speaker 2>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is another reason I would never </v>

491
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:47.800
<v Speaker 2>vote for Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

492
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone ever should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a corporate shell.</v>

493
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Don't vote for Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

494
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 2>the ending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were so many reasons not to.</v>

495
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Basically</v>

496
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.710
<v Speaker 1>we can get into that.</v>

497
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.463
<v Speaker 2>Gamers are actually quite familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 2>being attacked politically because of </v>

498
00:22:01.841 --> 00:22:02.674
<v Speaker 2>that hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though there hasn't been a single </v>

499
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:07.510
<v Speaker 2>study that's ever really conclusively </v>
<v Speaker 2>proven anything about Video Games.</v>

500
00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:08.080
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

501
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 2>there are dozens that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

502
00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.770
<v Speaker 2>there is no connection between video </v>
<v Speaker 2>games and anything.</v>

503
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the statistics,</v>

504
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 2>the rise of video games just coincided </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the dissenter violence.</v>

505
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that connected,</v>

506
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:20.674
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of those things that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is literally nothing to show the video </v>

507
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:25.270
<v Speaker 2>games or doing anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

508
00:22:25.271 --> 00:22:26.660
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a lot to show that doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things.</v>

509
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

510
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.173
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe it was around 91 or 92 </v>

511
00:22:31.161 --> 00:22:34.310
<v Speaker 1>when Joe Lieberman was leading that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight against video games.</v>

512
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.323
<v Speaker 1>I think it was because of mortal Kombat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing it on Sega Genesis at the </v>

513
00:22:38.181 --> 00:22:41.750
<v Speaker 1>time and I would come home from school </v>
<v Speaker 1>and play that for hours with my friends.</v>

514
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I never ripped anyone skull out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their spine attached to it,</v>

515
00:22:45.051 --> 00:22:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not once now.</v>

516
00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I tried once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

517
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never successfully did it.</v>

518
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.343
<v Speaker 1>So that says something actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can prove that it probably </v>

519
00:22:54.381 --> 00:22:58.700
<v Speaker 1>helps people in a more healthy way than </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of their anger and frustration.</v>

520
00:22:58.701 --> 00:22:59.534
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

521
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.640
<v Speaker 2>I think the multiplayer games on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

522
00:23:01.641 --> 00:23:02.474
<v Speaker 2>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get groups of guys to hang out and </v>

523
00:23:03.831 --> 00:23:05.600
<v Speaker 2>do something that's not dangerous or </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent,</v>

524
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think about it.</v>

525
00:23:07.041 --> 00:23:07.874
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

526
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.860
<v Speaker 2>if one playing video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were on the streets,</v>

527
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.433
<v Speaker 2>it was better for us to be at home </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing video games than to not be </v>

528
00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:16.500
<v Speaker 2>playing video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

529
00:23:16.501 --> 00:23:16.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

530
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I honestly can't see where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>objections come from.</v>

531
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.763
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same with anything like </v>

532
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.540
<v Speaker 2>dungeons and dragons in the ats or music</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the seventies,</v>

533
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games in the nineties and two </v>

534
00:23:25.461 --> 00:23:27.800
<v Speaker 2>thousands there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is always something that we,</v>

535
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poke clutching,</v>

536
00:23:29.481 --> 00:23:30.314
<v Speaker 2>moral majority or so they would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>position themselves as has got to rail </v>

537
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.243
<v Speaker 2>against something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ironically that was always the </v>

538
00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:38.470
<v Speaker 2>religious rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

539
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.420
<v Speaker 2>that was always the highly religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian.</v>

540
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Right now it is the highly regressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian left.</v>

541
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the horseshoe theory that we</v>

542
00:23:47.821 --> 00:23:51.630
<v Speaker 1>talk about all the time that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes on both sides come together.</v>

543
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so last thought on Gamer Gate,</v>

544
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:53.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I think is really </v>

545
00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.590
<v Speaker 1>nice about the community is that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are gamers,</v>

546
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.820
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what race you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what religion you are,</v>

547
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:03.803
<v Speaker 1>what sex or sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the little dividing boxes that </v>

548
00:24:07.321 --> 00:24:10.350
<v Speaker 1>the left wants to put us in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you are.</v>

549
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the community's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

550
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.700
<v Speaker 1>So then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when these people that are writing these</v>

551
00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:15.534
<v Speaker 1>articles say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well gamers or sexist or gamers or </v>

552
00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:19.030
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually,</v>

553
00:24:19.031 --> 00:24:19.864
<v Speaker 1>it literally has no meaning because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>as diverse a community as you could </v>

554
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:24.660
<v Speaker 1>possibly put out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

555
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>

556
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:27.463
<v Speaker 2>You literally can't tell by playing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>video game what race agenda The people </v>

557
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:34.040
<v Speaker 2>you're playing with are because everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to choose their own Avatar,</v>

558
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:35.390
<v Speaker 2>but it gets customized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their name,</v>

559
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the only way you'd know is by voice</v>

560
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:38.594
<v Speaker 2>chat know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the vast majority of people </v>

561
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 2>playing video games is not paid to </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity politics.</v>

562
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.153
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is the regressive </v>

563
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.643
<v Speaker 2>academics actually did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They spent a lot of times or planning </v>

564
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:52.664
<v Speaker 2>their assault on video games and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent time doing research and there was </v>

565
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.433
<v Speaker 2>an academic feminist academic called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adrian who did a series of studies not </v>

566
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 2>based on particularly large sample </v>
<v Speaker 2>sizes,</v>

567
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.294
<v Speaker 2>but large enough I would say to at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you the impression that they're </v>

568
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:09.014
<v Speaker 2>going the wrong direction because her </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions and she was someone looking </v>

569
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:13.270
<v Speaker 2>for a way to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.580
<v Speaker 2>crack open the video game industry with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a good reason to attack it.</v>

571
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.120
<v Speaker 2>She found that basically a mini games </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't need diversity.</v>

572
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Video Games had diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which meant that,</v>

573
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that in itself what,</v>

574
00:25:24.801 --> 00:25:25.634
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where does the regressive begin their </v>

575
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 2>plan of attack if the thing they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking is already diverse,</v>

576
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.540
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so basically it,</v>

577
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:33.374
<v Speaker 2>it led to her reframing the study she </v>
<v Speaker 2>had already conducted in a different </v>

578
00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:39.050
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

579
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the language is very opaque,</v>

580
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.650
<v Speaker 2>but basically she was not happy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a plurality of markets.</v>

581
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.260
<v Speaker 2>And now I personally think a plurality </v>
<v Speaker 2>of markets is a wonderful thing.</v>

582
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

583
00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.123
<v Speaker 2>if a video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want video games about the </v>

584
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Japanese Hentai great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your business.</v>

585
00:25:58.161 --> 00:25:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

586
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.340
<v Speaker 2>I will video games about killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs.</v>

587
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.570
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my niche.</v>

588
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 2>And everyone gets their own niche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:08.050
<v Speaker 2>whereas the problem that they had is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they wanted hedge ammonia overlap.</v>

590
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.193
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want a plurality of markets </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then you could have diverse </v>

591
00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:13.520
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have marcus on by this.</v>

592
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.593
<v Speaker 2>They won't say every market to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled effectively by their </v>

593
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:20.210
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And thankfully he's not going to happen.</v>

594
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to be clear about that.</v>

595
00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:22.694
<v Speaker 1>So there are people that are probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing Mario Kart that have nothing to </v>

596
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 1>do with the people that are playing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>games you're playing.</v>

597
00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:31.520
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't make sense even to lump </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those people together.</v>

598
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.813
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there will obviously be some </v>

599
00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:38.520
<v Speaker 2>crossover in every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every game genre,</v>

600
00:26:38.521 --> 00:26:39.354
<v Speaker 2>but by and large you get people who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>different preferences and they play </v>

601
00:26:42.511 --> 00:26:44.090
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm.</v>

602
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they,</v>

603
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big,</v>

604
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:48.800
<v Speaker 2>slightly polite as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

605
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 2>almost half of people playing video </v>
<v Speaker 2>games or women.</v>

606
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.003
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

607
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.420
<v Speaker 2>but what are they playing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't play call of duty,</v>

608
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not sitting there on their </v>

609
00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:56.763
<v Speaker 2>xboxes but the headphones and running </v>
<v Speaker 2>around calling each other gay that </v>

610
00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:01.693
<v Speaker 2>playing candy crush and Farmville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which all perfectly valid forms of </v>

611
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:05.964
<v Speaker 2>entertainment and more power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to play the games they want </v>

612
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:09.270
<v Speaker 2>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these,</v>

613
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.163
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.980
<v Speaker 2>by this point it doesn't justify </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing anything about the games I play</v>

615
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 2>because of the games they play and vice </v>
<v Speaker 2>versa is true.</v>

616
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't want their games being changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to suit me either.</v>

617
00:27:19.161 --> 00:27:19.994
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the last thing I would </v>

618
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:22.254
<v Speaker 2>want to impose on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is basically one of the </v>

619
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:26.640
<v Speaker 2>things the regressive left will always </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

620
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 2>is use statistics and the most slippery </v>
<v Speaker 2>way possible in Atlanta lies damn lies.</v>

621
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 2>And statistics really does apply it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

622
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will use statistics to justify </v>

623
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:37.973
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So be be careful about the use of </v>

624
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:41.820
<v Speaker 2>statistics with the regressive left.</v>

625
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.043
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've given me a perfect lane </v>

626
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.970
<v Speaker 1>through Gamergate to talk about probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

627
00:27:46.971 --> 00:27:47.804
<v Speaker 1>your other favorite thing to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least maybe your most </v>

628
00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 1>controversial thing to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is feminism.</v>

629
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

630
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.140
<v Speaker 1>let's go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk a little feminism A.</v>

631
00:27:58.141 --> 00:28:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you this in the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>broad sense.</v>

632
00:28:00.001 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Basically you don't like what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist movement has become.</v>

633
00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:04.404
<v Speaker 1>Is that fair to say?</v>

634
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

635
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.913
<v Speaker 2>one of the dangers of talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism is that it's very often </v>

636
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:15.840
<v Speaker 2>conflated with women and this is done </v>
<v Speaker 2>through eight women who exactly you're a</v>

637
00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:16.674
<v Speaker 2>misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last thing you will hear if ever you </v>

638
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:20.830
<v Speaker 2>have any complaint about feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

639
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is just obviously logically,</v>

640
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.500
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

641
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.903
<v Speaker 2>it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feminism itself as an ideology and </v>

642
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:29.514
<v Speaker 2>you've got male and female feminists and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get people who are male and female </v>

643
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:32.844
<v Speaker 2>opposed to modern feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that feminism is inherently </v>

644
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.630
<v Speaker 2>the same as women is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

645
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.280
<v Speaker 2>even the fewer and fewer women every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year are identifying as feminists at the</v>

646
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:45.480
<v Speaker 2>moment in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>

647
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.810
<v Speaker 2>only about 18 percent of women identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>as feminists.</v>

648
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:51.060
<v Speaker 2>And I knew something about nine percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of men,</v>

649
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.100
<v Speaker 2>whereas in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in say the seventies,</v>

650
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:54.750
<v Speaker 2>it was similar as high as 40 percent.</v>

651
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.970
<v Speaker 2>So the feminist movement is honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

652
00:28:57.971 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's doing yourself any </v>
<v Speaker 2>favors.</v>

653
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gotten full regressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

654
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

655
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have no problem calling myself a</v>

656
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 2>feminist if we were in the era of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second wave feminism.</v>

657
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:14.050
<v Speaker 2>We had some equity feminism to Christina</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hoff sommers oh,</v>

658
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Camille Paglia would be espousing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole equal rights,</v>

659
00:29:17.821 --> 00:29:22.821
<v Speaker 2>equal pay or the sort of the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you as any egalitarian would</v>

660
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:25.920
<v Speaker 2>be completely on board with and would </v>
<v Speaker 2>find absolutely no objection to.</v>

661
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:26.754
<v Speaker 2>I find that objection to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my problem is when we start getting </v>

662
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:30.294
<v Speaker 2>into the realms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I mean shaming language for you </v>

663
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 2>were misogynistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this you about you the other,</v>

664
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 2>when you have any objection and quoters </v>
<v Speaker 2>or any,</v>

665
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:38.840
<v Speaker 2>anything like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.230
<v Speaker 2>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get into conspiracy theories,</v>

667
00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

668
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 2>and then it becomes intersectional.</v>

669
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:49.770
<v Speaker 2>So now involves race and transsexuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and homosexuals and now it's a karaoke.</v>

670
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:55.510
<v Speaker 2>This is an insult linking a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressions and privileges.</v>

671
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And really you realize that what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want your luggage,</v>

672
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.330
<v Speaker 2>you say seeing is Marxist rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>

673
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:03.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you read the communist </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifesto,</v>

674
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.000
<v Speaker 2>you understand modern feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

675
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:05.863
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about the male </v>
<v Speaker 2>bourgeoisie and the female promaths </v>

676
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Harriet's and it's the same with black </v>
<v Speaker 2>and white,</v>

677
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 2>straight and gay and all these sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

678
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:13.924
<v Speaker 2>And I just don't ascribe to that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it implies a shared experience that we </v>

679
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Speaker 2>know men and women don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

680
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not just men and women,</v>

681
00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:22.904
<v Speaker 2>like black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of Trayvon Martin did not have the </v>

682
00:30:25.121 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 2>same life experiences as Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

683
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.533
<v Speaker 2>And so to say that being black is some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of inherent shared oppression that </v>

684
00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:33.610
<v Speaker 2>they have is ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.350
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>

686
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:40.350
<v Speaker 2>And my main problem really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's become anti individualistic</v>

687
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.591
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

688
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 2>you get famous feminist like any sockies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who will literally say things like,</v>

689
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>

690
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:49.330
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual women's choices don't count.</v>

691
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.980
<v Speaker 2>What Matt says is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what methods is feminism of the great,</v>

692
00:30:52.981 --> 00:30:54.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something for the greater good feminism,</v>

693
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:55.463
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember exactly how the quote </v>

694
00:30:56.951 --> 00:30:57.784
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just one of those things </v>

695
00:30:58.091 --> 00:30:59.440
<v Speaker 2>where it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

696
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so totally against this,</v>

697
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:04.720
<v Speaker 2>that I think I would be prepared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight a civil war against,</v>

698
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:05.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are so anti anti liberal </v>

699
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:10.180
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand them.</v>

700
00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.170
<v Speaker 1>So in a way it's evolved to where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer first off,</v>

701
00:31:15.171 --> 00:31:16.004
<v Speaker 1>women are a minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something like 50 slash </v>

702
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.100
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or 52 percent of the population,</v>

703
00:31:19.101 --> 00:31:22.280
<v Speaker 1>but where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you should be for the minority and</v>

704
00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:23.700
<v Speaker 1>a minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

705
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.850
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>

706
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.400
<v Speaker 1>they're eliminating the minority in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority.</v>

707
00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:29.383
<v Speaker 1>I think an example of that we could use </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the American political space would </v>

708
00:31:32.421 --> 00:31:33.860
<v Speaker 1>be someone like Sarah Pailin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

709
00:31:33.861 --> 00:31:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the views that Sarah Pailin</v>
<v Speaker 1>espouses spouses at all,</v>

710
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.950
<v Speaker 1>but can you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

711
00:31:39.951 --> 00:31:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big fan of Sarah Pailin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That being said,</v>

712
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:48.730
<v Speaker 1>she's obviously a very influential and </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and a self motivated woman.</v>

713
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.580
<v Speaker 1>So in a certain sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the ultimate,</v>

714
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal of what a feminist should be.</v>

715
00:31:55.491 --> 00:31:57.050
<v Speaker 1>But feminists hate her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

716
00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.180
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

717
00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.810
<v Speaker 2>She thinks wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the problem?</v>

718
00:31:59.811 --> 00:32:00.644
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't spinals she doesn't espouse </v>

719
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.370
<v Speaker 2>a regressive ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't.</v>

720
00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she called herself a feminist,</v>

721
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.160
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally she wouldn't be invoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxist ideas.</v>

722
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.140
<v Speaker 2>She would be invoking sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian ideas.</v>

723
00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.410
<v Speaker 2>So the strength of the individual hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

724
00:32:15.411 --> 00:32:16.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these.</v>

725
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Honestly I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

726
00:32:17.781 --> 00:32:19.250
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not bad ideas at all,</v>

727
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.440
<v Speaker 2>but she wouldn't be in the same camp as </v>
<v Speaker 2>say Gloria Steinem Steinem or bell hooks</v>

728
00:32:24.441 --> 00:32:26.580
<v Speaker 2>or someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

729
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 2>It's weird talking about Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

730
00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:32.110
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean almost no,</v>

731
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.630
<v Speaker 2>nobody really understands it these days </v>
<v Speaker 2>and any people understand it,</v>

732
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.060
<v Speaker 2>the academics and universities who teach</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

733
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.953
<v Speaker 2>and it is the manifesto is the third </v>
<v Speaker 2>most prescribed book in universities in </v>

734
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just seeing the communist manifesto.</v>

735
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Communism died everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the west,</v>

736
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.360
<v Speaker 2>it's so bizarre.</v>

737
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.910
<v Speaker 1>We fetishize these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

738
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

739
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:57.050
<v Speaker 2>people who live under communism hates </v>
<v Speaker 2>communism,</v>

740
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 2>they think is a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know that.</v>

741
00:32:59.121 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

742
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.180
<v Speaker 2>they had secure at three in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>for milk and eggs,</v>

743
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:04.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think is a terrible idea,</v>

744
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.143
<v Speaker 2>but the people in the west have never </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived through being put into practice </v>

745
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 2>and so they don't understand it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

746
00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:16.280
<v Speaker 2>they don't really viscerally understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real true nature of it I guess.</v>

747
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.040
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:18.923
<v Speaker 2>when you're sitting in a comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>house that's been built under </v>

749
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 2>capitalistic system and you've got lots </v>
<v Speaker 2>of money and you've,</v>

750
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:24.950
<v Speaker 2>you're doing very well for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You thinking,</v>

751
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should,</v>

752
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe it's not such a bad idea and</v>

753
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.193
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

754
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's these principles that inform almost</v>

755
00:33:32.391 --> 00:33:34.880
<v Speaker 2>everything about third wave feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about,</v>

756
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 2>it's all about power dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>privileged and oppressed,</v>

757
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:38.384
<v Speaker 2>privileged and oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I was watching the young </v>

758
00:33:39.741 --> 00:33:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Turks the other day.</v>

759
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.590
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Doyle,</v>

760
00:33:42.591 --> 00:33:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

761
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.013
<v Speaker 2>he actually had his tongue in his mouth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was saying that he was for the </v>

762
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 2>oppressed in every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he took the example of Israel.</v>

763
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:54.800
<v Speaker 2>So Israel oppressed as a Palestinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

764
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:56.120
<v Speaker 2>He's in February,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Palestinian man.</v>

765
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And then if the Palestinian amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>presses,</v>

766
00:33:57.891 --> 00:33:58.724
<v Speaker 2>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fair for the wife and it's just </v>

767
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:00.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

768
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:00.983
<v Speaker 2>but you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just said you are and are not in </v>

769
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 2>favor of the Palestinian man there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jenny,</v>

770
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is inherently cultural.</v>

771
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:09.560
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be in favor of the man and the</v>

772
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one are you in favor of?</v>

774
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:13.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that kind of,</v>

775
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:15.303
<v Speaker 2>it's got this inherent contradiction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they don't seem to want to </v>

776
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:18.770
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge that.</v>

777
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:19.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why as we've said for awhile </v>

778
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.930
<v Speaker 1>and now this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this regressive ideology,</v>

779
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.003
<v Speaker 1>it's always putting narrative over fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really the most when you whittle </v>

780
00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:33.790
<v Speaker 1>it down to what it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be narrative over fact.</v>

781
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:38.540
<v Speaker 1>So you just pick the most depressed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get everybody on the ladder and</v>

782
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:39.374
<v Speaker 1>then that's how you judge everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the reverse of judging a </v>

783
00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:45.500
<v Speaker 1>minority within a minority and those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that we should be for.</v>

784
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

785
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:47.954
<v Speaker 2>In the crazy thing about it as well is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these things are inherently racist </v>

786
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:54.230
<v Speaker 2>and sexist and any other issue you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

787
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.350
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is that normally when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think,</v>

788
00:34:57.351 --> 00:34:58.220
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being a racist,</v>

789
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:03.250
<v Speaker 2>you think you're being racist to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the oppressed if that's what you</v>

790
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:04.184
<v Speaker 2>want is called the minority who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffered from racial discrimination </v>

791
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.903
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.223
<v Speaker 2>black people or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pressing women or something like </v>

793
00:35:10.521 --> 00:35:13.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But racism and sexism,</v>

794
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.230
<v Speaker 2>despite what the regressives will tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

795
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not structures or systems of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their principles,</v>

796
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.090
<v Speaker 2>their ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

797
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.270
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll ways of viewing the world and so</v>

798
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.710
<v Speaker 2>you can be racist to white people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be sexist to men and vice versa.</v>

799
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:31.020
<v Speaker 2>And so it's this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say the narrative they've,</v>

800
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:31.913
<v Speaker 2>they've gone out of the way to redefine </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of woods and then they have </v>

801
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.083
<v Speaker 2>cherry picked data points to arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nice location where they can say you </v>

802
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:41.550
<v Speaker 2>as a white man and not allowed to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

803
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:42.384
<v Speaker 2>Because you're a white man and they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally turn around and tell you that </v>

804
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 2>is not racist and sexist.</v>

805
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.453
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give them enough credit to say </v>

806
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:49.404
<v Speaker 1>they've picked these data points because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in most cases they haven't even </v>

807
00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:53.470
<v Speaker 1>gotten that far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

808
00:35:53.471 --> 00:35:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you're giving them the benefit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt that I can no longer give them.</v>

809
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 1>But we started here on feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's not go too far.</v>

810
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.193
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the interesting thing that </v>

811
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:03.570
<v Speaker 1>every time I'm talking about all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

812
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.553
<v Speaker 1>we realize how the Inter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this interlink theme between </v>

813
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Gamergate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between feminism,</v>

814
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:09.450
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

815
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as feminism,</v>

816
00:36:11.011 --> 00:36:11.844
<v Speaker 1>I saw an interesting video that you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you took the three types of what </v>

817
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you said were the three types of male </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminists.</v>

818
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was really interesting </v>

819
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 1>because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I defend women,</v>

820
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

821
00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I believe women should be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

822
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:27.804
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty much it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyone can define me however they </v>

823
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:31.914
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought the way you broke these </v>

824
00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:35.040
<v Speaker 1>three type of men down was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

825
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that for us?</v>

826
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

827
00:36:37.581 --> 00:36:38.650
<v Speaker 2>it was while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did that video.</v>

828
00:36:38.651 --> 00:36:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

829
00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:44.090
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically self interest I think.</v>

830
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get some,</v>

831
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:46.913
<v Speaker 2>you get men who are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to be rewarded for doing </v>

832
00:36:51.351 --> 00:36:56.351
<v Speaker 2>something heroic and protective and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that a change might fall into this</v>

833
00:36:57.111 --> 00:36:59.840
<v Speaker 2>category where he's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a big guy,</v>

834
00:36:59.841 --> 00:37:01.380
<v Speaker 2>he's not he himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

835
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't have any particular fears </v>

836
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:07.460
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for his own physical security.</v>

837
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.533
<v Speaker 2>And so he thinks I'm going to use my </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical presence to protect women </v>

838
00:37:11.781 --> 00:37:13.520
<v Speaker 2>because that would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

839
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a laudable thing to do.</v>

840
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.823
<v Speaker 2>And it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that they're doing it for their </v>

841
00:37:17.751 --> 00:37:21.050
<v Speaker 2>own self interests that don't get thrown</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

842
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.160
<v Speaker 2>for their own personal feelings.</v>

843
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.250
<v Speaker 1>The other end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a guy who basically wants to get</v>

844
00:37:25.251 --> 00:37:26.240
<v Speaker 1>laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

845
00:37:26.241 --> 00:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of respects,</v>

846
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

847
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:30.220
<v Speaker 2>I kind of Miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

848
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.420
<v Speaker 2>the thing is it's not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting lady though love.</v>

849
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.480
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is just for just for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of emotional reward,</v>

850
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like a social.</v>

851
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:39.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

852
00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:41.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just just,</v>

853
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to get the pat on the head,</v>

854
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:44.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

855
00:37:44.601 --> 00:37:47.130
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of to feel good about </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

856
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.650
<v Speaker 2>but requires permission from someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

857
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 2>This case being a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is you end up,</v>

858
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Speaker 2>you end up getting ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

859
00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really unhealthy dynamics because you'll</v>

860
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 2>find women who are looking for men to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>things for.</v>

861
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.033
<v Speaker 2>And you will find men who are looking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do things for women and you will get </v>

862
00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 2>this kind of feedback loop where they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforce each other,</v>

863
00:38:07.231 --> 00:38:08.064
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

864
00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.620
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy stands up for this woman who is</v>

865
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.960
<v Speaker 2>using him to fight her battles.</v>

866
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.700
<v Speaker 2>And so this guy ends up fighting battles</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his battles but are being reinforced,</v>

867
00:38:17.701 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 2>constantly buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

868
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:21.870
<v Speaker 2>this is not like all women in most women</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not like this,</v>

869
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:23.060
<v Speaker 2>but you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

870
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.310
<v Speaker 2>women are humans too and you get bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>women as well as good women.</v>

871
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.503
<v Speaker 2>And you find that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is basically one of the problems </v>

872
00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:32.430
<v Speaker 2>with the progressive because like we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying earlier,</v>

873
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.620
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to come back to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>progresses,</v>

874
00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:35.454
<v Speaker 2>but feminism is just one like brunch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the umbrella of the progressive </v>

875
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:40.540
<v Speaker 2>sort of tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

876
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:41.374
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

877
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all ties together.</v>

878
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you said you get most people when </v>

879
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:47.080
<v Speaker 2>they think they're doing it for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right reasons.</v>

880
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:47.943
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

881
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good person.</v>

882
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I need to be helping women in minorities</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gays and Trans and whatever.</v>

883
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.343
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is that they have this kind </v>

884
00:38:56.381 --> 00:39:00.730
<v Speaker 2>of toolbox of rhetoric that virtue </v>
<v Speaker 2>signals to other regressives.</v>

885
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 2>It shows them say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

886
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm using this kind of language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore I'm on your team.</v>

887
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 2>You can come and support me on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>or wherever you know,</v>

888
00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you will get people who think,</v>

889
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.471
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

890
00:39:11.471 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do that because I'm always </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to be an activist onto something</v>

891
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:14.974
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'll get the other kind of </v>

892
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:18.640
<v Speaker 2>person who is the more malicious person </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will think,</v>

893
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can use this to my own advantage.</v>

894
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 2>And they are the people you've got to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>really worried about.</v>

895
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

896
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.370
<v Speaker 2>In gamer gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a woman called Randy Harper.</v>

897
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.260
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't actually pop game gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was part of the problem,</v>

898
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.040
<v Speaker 2>but some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

899
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:31.893
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it most starkly </v>

900
00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:36.940
<v Speaker 2>represented than in her example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 2011,</v>

901
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 2>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

902
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:39.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was on a BSD,</v>

903
00:39:39.761 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 2>which is a programming language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a podcast.</v>

904
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.290
<v Speaker 2>And she was literally saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

905
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm a woman in tech and I don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with this.</v>

906
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:46.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

907
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I think the feminists have of blowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this problem with ms dot progeny and the</v>

908
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 2>tech industry and all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a women in tech.</v>

909
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's great.</v>

910
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:54.963
<v Speaker 2>And Lo behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years later when it's shown to be a </v>

911
00:39:56.681 --> 00:39:59.950
<v Speaker 2>profitable business model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is literally on twitter.</v>

912
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Say I'm an oppressed woman in Tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need your money,</v>

913
00:40:02.891 --> 00:40:03.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me money every month through </v>

914
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.200
<v Speaker 2>patriots and also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

915
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the complete polar opposite of what</v>

916
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:10.150
<v Speaker 2>you were saying before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like really?</v>

917
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 2>So either the industry has become </v>
<v Speaker 2>massively sexist overnights.</v>

918
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.400
<v Speaker 2>You found a way to profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

919
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.060
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

920
00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.700
<v Speaker 1>so this is sort of something we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>find with any movement.</v>

921
00:40:19.701 --> 00:40:21.380
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're saying this,</v>

922
00:40:21.381 --> 00:40:23.570
<v Speaker 1>but that this isn't specific to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminism.</v>

923
00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.493
<v Speaker 1>Any movements can have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's people who are doing it with the </v>

924
00:40:26.181 --> 00:40:27.014
<v Speaker 1>right intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have the people that are </v>

925
00:40:28.491 --> 00:40:29.324
<v Speaker 1>being guilted into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have the people that are </v>

926
00:40:30.411 --> 00:40:31.244
<v Speaker 1>being tricked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna have the people that can </v>

927
00:40:32.061 --> 00:40:34.490
<v Speaker 1>profit from it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single movement.</v>

928
00:40:34.491 --> 00:40:36.740
<v Speaker 1>And you're just using feminism is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

929
00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

930
00:40:38.121 --> 00:40:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

931
00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:43.070
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to mock up what feminism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something to that effect.</v>

932
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

933
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

934
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.020
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

935
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.230
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is again,</v>

936
00:40:46.231 --> 00:40:47.064
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily feminism because </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism is just a subsection of the </v>

937
00:40:49.341 --> 00:40:50.790
<v Speaker 2>social justice movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

938
00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:55.791
<v Speaker 2>you've got some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it into sectionalism is like,</v>

939
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.690
<v Speaker 2>there's bell hooks describes it as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.</v>

940
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:01.883
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprising you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are a supporter of the white </v>

941
00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:09.560
<v Speaker 2>supremacist capitalist Patriarchy date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually propagates.</v>

942
00:41:09.561 --> 00:41:10.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a terrible person.</v>

943
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>But basically what this encompasses is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

944
00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:14.043
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dynamics between black people and </v>

945
00:41:15.151 --> 00:41:16.500
<v Speaker 2>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The white supremacy,</v>

946
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.713
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capitalism is the poor and the rich </v>

947
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.700
<v Speaker 2>and the patriarchy being men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

948
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I think they probably have terms for gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>and straight and Trans and CIS.</v>

949
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.600
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not familiar with them off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of my head,</v>

950
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the point at some,</v>

951
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 2>they have this toolbox of tubs and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a academic background.</v>

952
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.610
<v Speaker 2>All of this comes from academia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this,</v>

953
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has all been.</v>

954
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.751
<v Speaker 2>And People Think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

955
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:40.100
<v Speaker 2>this is coming from tumblr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

956
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:40.934
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow is the outgrowth of this </v>

957
00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:43.923
<v Speaker 2>council.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

958
00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.760
<v Speaker 2>this is coming to the surface in popular</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

959
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 2>This all comes from sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:52.490
<v Speaker 2>the halls of academia where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start with a premise,</v>

961
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.700
<v Speaker 2>they confirm their biases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the peer review,</v>

962
00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:56.534
<v Speaker 2>that own papers between feminists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they carry on building from that </v>

963
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:01.220
<v Speaker 2>until they've got to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they will,</v>

964
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the redefinition of things.</v>

965
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.693
<v Speaker 2>The reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason the progressives are so </v>

966
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 2>dangerous is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

967
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:10.034
<v Speaker 2>with every movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get people who are </v>

968
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 2>profit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terry Union,</v>

969
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 2>people doing it for their own selfish </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>

970
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.013
<v Speaker 2>but I can't think of any movement that </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimately has an excuse to be </v>

971
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 2>malevolent to people for any good </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

972
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.123
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every single one he let Christy </v>

973
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.770
<v Speaker 2>has been love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love your neighbor as yourself,</v>

974
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:28.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like for very individualistic Zena </v>

975
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 2>individual rights in representative </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy,</v>

976
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 2>everyone gets to be treated in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal,</v>

977
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Brotherhood of man and all that sort</v>

978
00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:38.234
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas these people have something </v>

979
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually have,</v>

980
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.300
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

981
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember which feminists that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm quoting and they say this,</v>

982
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:46.303
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Andrea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk Him when they say that women have </v>

983
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:48.824
<v Speaker 2>the right to hate their oppresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is for me a particularly scary </v>

984
00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes,</v>

985
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.130
<v Speaker 2>it goes totally for what the black lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter movement,</v>

986
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.830
<v Speaker 2>who all subscribed to this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>

987
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.203
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the way of legitimizing hatred for </v>

988
00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:10.130
<v Speaker 2>people based on what is perceived to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>social advantages.</v>

989
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 2>So if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

990
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:13.550
<v Speaker 2>you're a white man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore you have special lunches,</v>

991
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.400
<v Speaker 2>therefore it's not bad for me to hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

992
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.580
<v Speaker 2>You know I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say all sorts of things to you and</v>

993
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 2>it's okay because you have privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm oppressed.</v>

994
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.420
<v Speaker 2>You're privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>

995
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:25.580
<v Speaker 2>no matter what I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter,</v>

996
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:28.460
<v Speaker 2>even though in an interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction,</v>

997
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.030
<v Speaker 2>if you say some horrible things to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm helped by,</v>

998
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

999
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm a regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my white privilege isn't actually a</v>

1000
00:43:34.191 --> 00:43:36.260
<v Speaker 2>shield from horrible word.</v>

1001
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1002
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.793
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes the distinction away from </v>

1003
00:43:39.011 --> 00:43:39.844
<v Speaker 1>someone from a male who is doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything he can to fight for women's </v>

1004
00:43:45.731 --> 00:43:46.564
<v Speaker 1>rights and equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm an a man who is against those </v>

1005
00:43:49.361 --> 00:43:50.194
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just say it's white men or it's </v>

1006
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.140
<v Speaker 1>just men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we saw this,</v>

1007
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.983
<v Speaker 1>a great example of this I think is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks ago with those Cologne </v>

1008
00:43:56.921 --> 00:43:57.754
<v Speaker 1>attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I saw all these feminists writing </v>

1009
00:43:59.831 --> 00:44:02.830
<v Speaker 1>articles and tweeting saying things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1010
00:44:02.831 --> 00:44:06.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a migrant problem,</v>

1011
00:44:06.161 --> 00:44:06.994
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a religion problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were doing everything to get it </v>

1012
00:44:09.641 --> 00:44:14.641
<v Speaker 1>away from the identity of the specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who did this and try,</v>

1013
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:18.730
<v Speaker 1>this is a male problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is crazy.</v>

1014
00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.960
<v Speaker 1>This is actually crazy.</v>

1015
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.103
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened in Cologne was something </v>

1016
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:26.630
<v Speaker 2>called Tara rush a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just Arabic,</v>

1017
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:29.470
<v Speaker 2>the group assault or sexual assaults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1018
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:33.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's something that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think the first instance of it was,</v>

1019
00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it was originally recorded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fifties,</v>

1020
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:35.964
<v Speaker 2>but I guess it kind of wasn't something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really came to the surface until </v>

1021
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:43.791
<v Speaker 2>about 2011 in the Egyptian Arab spring </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I,</v>

1022
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a CNN journalist,</v>

1023
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:50.530
<v Speaker 2>was basically surrounded by a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys in,</v>

1024
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.713
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Cairo and then molested and forcibly </v>

1025
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 2>be molested by gangs of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

1026
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 2>this happened on New Year's Eve all </v>
<v Speaker 2>across Europe.</v>

1027
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.640
<v Speaker 2>It happened in Stockholm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helsinki,</v>

1028
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 2>or attempted to in multiple German </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>

1029
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1030
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:07.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1031
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 2>the police chief literally said nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this ever happened before.</v>

1032
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 2>And so when feminists say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1033
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 2>this is just men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that's wrong,</v>

1034
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1035
00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:16.893
<v Speaker 2>we know that's when we know that it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably tied to retrograde attitudes </v>

1036
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:23.190
<v Speaker 2>towards women coming from the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1037
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.113
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying every Muslim or anything </v>

1038
00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1039
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:27.324
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't go to the Islamic world and </v>

1040
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.233
<v Speaker 2>look around and see how things are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that women are treated the same </v>

1041
00:45:33.261 --> 00:45:34.140
<v Speaker 2>there as they are here.</v>

1042
00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1043
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.713
<v Speaker 1>so that's a perfect segue to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist and is video that you had </v>

1044
00:45:41.421 --> 00:45:42.254
<v Speaker 1>mirrored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was the guy that originally created </v>

1045
00:45:43.701 --> 00:45:44.534
<v Speaker 1>the video?</v>

1046
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:45.423
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The video was originally done by a </v>

1047
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.420
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small youtube called Seitan atheist.</v>

1048
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.573
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He created this cartoon video and </v>

1049
00:45:52.381 --> 00:45:53.214
<v Speaker 1>it's a song and it's basically a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist and Islamist singing together </v>

1050
00:45:57.091 --> 00:46:01.170
<v Speaker 1>about why they sort of see the world in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way.</v>

1051
00:46:01.171 --> 00:46:02.004
<v Speaker 1>That was the thrust of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw the video and before all hell </v>

1052
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 1>broke loose about it before Richard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins retweeted it,</v>

1053
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:10.134
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it and I thought it was pretty </v>

1054
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:12.534
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great satirical takedown of this </v>

1055
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:17.130
<v Speaker 1>regressive nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1056
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize at the time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently the,</v>

1057
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:24.330
<v Speaker 1>the female character playing the piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently that was actually based off a</v>

1058
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:25.350
<v Speaker 1>real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1059
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:26.184
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1060
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 2>So the Islamist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Islamist is a youtuber called dollar</v>

1061
00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.500
<v Speaker 2>man who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1062
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.513
<v Speaker 2>he runs around proclaiming Islamism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>united saying that everyone should </v>

1063
00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:36.390
<v Speaker 2>bounce with Islam and all that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1064
00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:37.224
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't victimizing anyone in </v>

1065
00:46:39.451 --> 00:46:41.640
<v Speaker 2>particular in these parodies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>

1066
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.653
<v Speaker 2>but the individuals who have become </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous because of their terrible ideas </v>

1067
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:45.940
<v Speaker 2>and Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1068
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1069
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.691
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1070
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:49.524
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

1071
00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:50.403
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to say that I wrote it or </v>

1072
00:46:51.661 --> 00:46:52.530
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>

1073
00:46:52.531 --> 00:46:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I literally emailed the guy and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1074
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.960
<v Speaker 2>I really like your channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to help promote you.</v>

1075
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.113
<v Speaker 2>Do me a piece of unique content that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can put my child wouldn't blink back to </v>

1076
00:47:00.121 --> 00:47:00.960
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1077
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.540
<v Speaker 2>and so you sent me this video and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1078
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I put it up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

1079
00:47:05.621 --> 00:47:08.280
<v Speaker 2>and all hell broke loose when Richard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins retweeted it.</v>

1080
00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.373
<v Speaker 1>So basically all Dawkins did was retweet</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and suddenly his twitter feed blew </v>

1081
00:47:14.811 --> 00:47:19.160
<v Speaker 1>up and he was deep platform from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking event at the.</v>

1082
00:47:19.161 --> 00:47:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Any CSS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the northeast conference of</v>

1083
00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.610
<v Speaker 1>secular skeptics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptics and secularism.</v>

1084
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Something close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the platform from it.</v>

1085
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.150
<v Speaker 1>They applied for them without even </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling him.</v>

1086
00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't even a phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't ask for an explanation.</v>

1087
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:35.403
<v Speaker 1>He then</v>

1088
00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 2>he made a public statement to virtue </v>
<v Speaker 2>signal.</v>

1089
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.850
<v Speaker 2>That's the important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were telling you,</v>

1090
00:47:38.851 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 2>the regressives look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1091
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 2>with d platforming him because he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>done something transgressive to us,</v>

1092
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't show everyone else.</v>

1093
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 2>We're on where we're at the front </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1094
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:49.720
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a terrible thing.</v>

1095
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.350
<v Speaker 2>The irony being Richard Dawkins was </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a big draw for that place.</v>

1096
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:54.250
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1097
00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1098
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:56.703
<v Speaker 2>they might get three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 people that Richard Dawkins has </v>

1099
00:47:58.841 --> 00:48:00.550
<v Speaker 2>millions of followers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1100
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1101
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Speaker 2>he's doing them a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1102
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't,</v>

1103
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.093
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've kind of shot themselves in the </v>

1104
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:07.414
<v Speaker 2>foot and they've just made themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>with really intolerant because his </v>

1105
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 2>original tweet was obviously as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist myself,</v>

1106
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.993
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't apply to all feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is definitely a pernicious </v>

1107
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:19.210
<v Speaker 2>minority and low and behold the punishes</v>
<v Speaker 2>minority rose up and you know,</v>

1108
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Speaker 2>got in his face and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1109
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:22.240
<v Speaker 2>well you're just proving the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the video.</v>

1110
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're literally proving the point of</v>

1111
00:48:24.921 --> 00:48:25.754
<v Speaker 1>the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're literally proving that these two </v>

1112
00:48:28.701 --> 00:48:33.701
<v Speaker 1>groups for all the wrong reasons have </v>
<v Speaker 1>become partners.</v>

1113
00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.293
<v Speaker 1>That there's one ideology that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feminist unfortunately or some </v>

1114
00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:44.291
<v Speaker 1>degree of feminist seem to be okay with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same ideology that would do</v>

1115
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.180
<v Speaker 1>the worst to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1116
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.790
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to believe that we,</v>

1117
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.710
<v Speaker 1>even as I'm saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking this is completely bonkers.</v>

1118
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.840
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bunk.</v>

1119
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm without intersection Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense at all,</v>

1120
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:57.680
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>

1121
00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:59.340
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to thinking sexually,</v>

1122
00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.760
<v Speaker 2>so you think Ryan white person than </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown person than men,</v>

1123
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.980
<v Speaker 2>women and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1124
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.660
<v Speaker 2>what the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the most oppressive thing,</v>

1125
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.720
<v Speaker 2>so I'm am oppressed in the woman that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite bad,</v>

1126
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:11.763
<v Speaker 2>but a white person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pressing a brown person that's much </v>

1127
00:49:13.661 --> 00:49:14.494
<v Speaker 2>worse and therefore now we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a bunch of Brown people being </v>

1128
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.933
<v Speaker 2>oppressed by a bunch of white people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the fact that men and women are </v>

1129
00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:23.920
<v Speaker 2>oppressing each other brown winter or </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressing white women,</v>

1130
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:24.873
<v Speaker 2>that's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The important bit is the skin color </v>

1131
00:49:26.891 --> 00:49:27.724
<v Speaker 2>above the sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm genuinely surprised that I </v>

1132
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:30.604
<v Speaker 2>thought feminist would go the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that they would be more </v>

1133
00:49:32.681 --> 00:49:34.570
<v Speaker 2>concerned about men oppressing women in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lynn Brown.</v>

1134
00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 2>People are being oppressed by white </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1135
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.293
<v Speaker 2>but apparently the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1136
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently not.</v>

1137
00:49:38.321 --> 00:49:39.154
<v Speaker 1>So in your estimation then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing the way the feminist movement </v>

1138
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:42.963
<v Speaker 1>has evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously I've had Christina Hoff </v>

1139
00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 1>summers on the show and I've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>her about some of this stuff.</v>

1140
00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:47.973
<v Speaker 1>What would you say is the best?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just want true equality for the </v>

1141
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:54.190
<v Speaker 1>sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're married to a woman,</v>

1142
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:55.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like women,</v>

1143
00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.750
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual guy that likes women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1144
00:49:59.020 --> 00:49:59.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say is the best way for </v>

1145
00:50:02.861 --> 00:50:05.650
<v Speaker 1>men and for women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for anyone that cares about the ideas of</v>

1146
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>feminism to go out and act on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas?</v>

1147
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1148
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.713
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the problems that </v>

1149
00:50:12.921 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 2>feminism has now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern feminism has,</v>

1150
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.300
<v Speaker 2>this is one of dragons to slay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.163
<v Speaker 2>I mean men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women have complete legal </v>

1152
00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:21.590
<v Speaker 2>equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of it whenever,</v>

1153
00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.540
<v Speaker 2>whenever a feminist is challenging you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

1154
00:50:23.541 --> 00:50:23.961
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1155
00:50:23.961 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>the men are oppressing women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask them what legal men have.</v>

1156
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't leave it.</v>

1157
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.840
<v Speaker 2>There just aren't any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're at the point now where,</v>

1158
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1159
00:50:34.361 --> 00:50:35.194
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what more needs to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We seem to be living in quite stable </v>

1160
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:39.284
<v Speaker 2>liberal democracies where merit methods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously in everything it is a </v>

1161
00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:45.710
<v Speaker 2>lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what it is is who,</v>

1162
00:50:45.711 --> 00:50:46.670
<v Speaker 2>you know rather than what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1163
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Butts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>merit,</v>

1164
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.330
<v Speaker 2>still massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1165
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.173
<v Speaker 2>you can't just hire someone for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary characteristics if they can't </v>

1166
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:54.980
<v Speaker 2>do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you mean no one,</v>

1167
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 2>no one thinks that.</v>

1168
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm personally,</v>

1169
00:50:58.461 --> 00:50:59.294
<v Speaker 2>I just think don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't make judgments based on racial </v>

1170
00:51:01.341 --> 00:51:04.790
<v Speaker 2>gender or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or transgenderism or you know,</v>

1171
00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 2>or homosexuality or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1172
00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:10.880
<v Speaker 2>these characteristics that Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very useful to judge people on.</v>

1173
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:11.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1174
00:51:11.861 --> 00:51:12.694
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your being a white man doesn't in any </v>

1175
00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:17.090
<v Speaker 2>way inform how good an inferior you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1176
00:51:17.091 --> 00:51:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1177
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not watching you because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>white man.</v>

1178
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:20.474
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching you because I like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests you have on what the questions </v>

1179
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:25.280
<v Speaker 2>you asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let the ounces you get out with them.</v>

1180
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:27.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that has anything to do with you</v>

1181
00:51:27.681 --> 00:51:29.060
<v Speaker 2>being white or male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A straight.</v>

1182
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or anything about this.</v>

1183
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:31.023
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they completely pointless and arbitrary </v>

1184
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 2>characteristics that really apply.</v>

1185
00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really all we have to do is just keep</v>

1186
00:51:37.331 --> 00:51:38.770
<v Speaker 1>hammering the point home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1187
00:51:38.771 --> 00:51:43.771
<v Speaker 1>If if were for people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remove this identity politics stuff,</v>

1188
00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:44.973
<v Speaker 1>we just have to keep hammering that </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it becomes so obvious and I do </v>

1189
00:51:48.251 --> 00:51:49.084
<v Speaker 1>think that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where we can sort of pivot </v>

1190
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.020
<v Speaker 1>to a little more of the regressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactics.</v>

1191
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.093
<v Speaker 1>This is where we can really beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're tough to beat because we know </v>

1192
00:51:57.101 --> 00:51:57.934
<v Speaker 1>they're going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know they're gonna cheat and </v>

1193
00:51:59.561 --> 00:52:01.810
<v Speaker 1>misinformed people and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1194
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:03.213
<v Speaker 1>but what we can keep hammering them with</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we want equality for everybody </v>

1195
00:52:07.061 --> 00:52:11.200
<v Speaker 1>regardless of borders and nationality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and religion and everything else.</v>

1196
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1197
00:52:12.001 --> 00:52:12.834
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamentals of the fundamental </v>

1198
00:52:14.221 --> 00:52:17.170
<v Speaker 2>principles of liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a universal mats that,</v>

1199
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.023
<v Speaker 2>that was the great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great gift of sort of English </v>

1200
00:52:20.491 --> 00:52:21.324
<v Speaker 2>liberalism is individual rights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal principles that you think are </v>

1201
00:52:25.281 --> 00:52:25.681
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1202
00:52:25.681 --> 00:52:28.830
<v Speaker 2>we've not always applied these evenly or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like this.</v>

1203
00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:30.203
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially they were exclusively for </v>

1204
00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:34.530
<v Speaker 2>white heterosexual men at the very top </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the pyramid.</v>

1205
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.873
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that the principals </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously lend themselves to cascading </v>

1206
00:52:39.421 --> 00:52:40.254
<v Speaker 2>downwards because as soon as you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people who are espousing these </v>

1207
00:52:42.811 --> 00:52:43.644
<v Speaker 2>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no good reason not to extend </v>

1208
00:52:45.151 --> 00:52:45.984
<v Speaker 2>the franchise to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why we now have universal </v>

1209
00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:50.380
<v Speaker 2>suffrage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It Yukon.</v>

1210
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:55.080
<v Speaker 2>There's no justification to not united.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The on all of the justification is given</v>

1211
00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.330
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously faulting,</v>

1212
00:52:56.331 --> 00:52:57.690
<v Speaker 2>which is why we're now at the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we are.</v>

1213
00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1214
00:52:59.671 --> 00:53:02.400
<v Speaker 2>it just basically stay true to your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>

1215
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:04.560
<v Speaker 2>If you think it's wrong to judge by </v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

1216
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.290
<v Speaker 2>don't judge people by race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what race they are.</v>

1217
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.060
<v Speaker 2>If you think it's wrong to judge by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1218
00:53:09.061 --> 00:53:10.900
<v Speaker 2>by sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't judge people by sex,</v>

1219
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:11.510
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1220
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:12.810
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1221
00:53:12.811 --> 00:53:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I can say is that these are timeless</v>

1222
00:53:14.971 --> 00:53:17.930
<v Speaker 2>principles that will always be relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1223
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:20.280
<v Speaker 2>they will never be a time where someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1224
00:53:20.281 --> 00:53:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually it is because I'm black,</v>

1225
00:53:22.021 --> 00:53:24.990
<v Speaker 2>that I should be judged is because I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman that I should be.</v>

1226
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.543
<v Speaker 2>And it's only because these people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got a lot of good and very </v>

1227
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 2>slippery language and techniques to </v>
<v Speaker 2>persuade people that in fact,</v>

1228
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given this context,</v>

1229
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.850
<v Speaker 2>it's right to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I'm of the opinion that there is</v>

1230
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:39.684
<v Speaker 2>no context in which its rights to judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>people based on characteristics they </v>

1231
00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:45.510
<v Speaker 2>have no control over if you didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to choose it.</v>

1232
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not a part of your character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't describe you as a person,</v>

1233
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:51.230
<v Speaker 2>it just describes your body or your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1234
00:53:51.231 --> 00:53:55.320
<v Speaker 2>your physical characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't describe what you are like in</v>

1235
00:53:55.321 --> 00:53:56.000
<v Speaker 2>your character.</v>

1236
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.833
<v Speaker 1>So does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think this also goes to the </v>

1237
00:53:58.071 --> 00:54:00.920
<v Speaker 1>feeling part of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's sort of what I'm thinking</v>

1238
00:54:00.921 --> 00:54:02.290
<v Speaker 1>as you're saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is,</v>

1239
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:07.480
<v Speaker 1>there is a feeling that I think this </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressive ideology is attached to.</v>

1240
00:54:07.701 --> 00:54:10.580
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give you a,</v>

1241
00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:11.414
<v Speaker 1>as you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give you an example of where </v>

1242
00:54:13.701 --> 00:54:17.060
<v Speaker 1>systemically in the United States that </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are oppressed,</v>

1243
00:54:17.061 --> 00:54:18.270
<v Speaker 1>meaning that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1244
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:19.850
<v Speaker 1>there are now laws protecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1245
00:54:19.851 --> 00:54:21.650
<v Speaker 1>equal opportunity laws and things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1246
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:22.783
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that women don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a harder time related to certain </v>

1247
00:54:26.181 --> 00:54:27.740
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If business deals,</v>

1248
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:28.723
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are being done on golf courses and less </v>

1249
00:54:30.441 --> 00:54:31.274
<v Speaker 1>women play golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then they're going to be excluded </v>

1250
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:35.720
<v Speaker 1>and then you could probably think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1251
00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:39.380
<v Speaker 1>many examples like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what that is really more about is,</v>

1252
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.490
<v Speaker 1>is a feeling not sort of a systemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal issue.</v>

1253
00:54:43.491 --> 00:54:47.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where people struggle to separate</v>

1254
00:54:47.241 --> 00:54:48.074
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

1255
00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:48.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1256
00:54:48.861 --> 00:54:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like,</v>

1257
00:54:50.391 --> 00:54:52.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1258
00:54:52.071 --> 00:54:52.904
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the company that does the sex </v>

1259
00:54:54.471 --> 00:54:59.000
<v Speaker 2>toys and some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of this is a British company.</v>

1260
00:54:59.001 --> 00:55:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds sex toys.</v>

1261
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.033
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was created by a woman and a large </v>

1262
00:55:04.251 --> 00:55:05.084
<v Speaker 2>portion of the company is run by women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably don't do that business </v>

1263
00:55:07.701 --> 00:55:09.260
<v Speaker 2>deals on golf courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1264
00:55:09.261 --> 00:55:10.190
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably have,</v>

1265
00:55:10.191 --> 00:55:12.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass on nail salons or something like,</v>

1266
00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:13.170
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1267
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:16.820
<v Speaker 2>and I'm saying stereotypical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't go to the golf courses.</v>

1268
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:17.833
<v Speaker 2>So I would have to change my position </v>
<v Speaker 2>and perspective and I would have to go </v>

1269
00:55:21.081 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 2>to where the power is in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1270
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1271
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.180
<v Speaker 2>they're all going to be cases where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have um,</v>

1272
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:32.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful ceos who go golfing and the way</v>

1273
00:55:32.841 --> 00:55:36.710
<v Speaker 2>to get into the good graces would be to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go go from as well.</v>

1274
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1275
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.670
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you've got to make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1276
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:41.853
<v Speaker 2>I personally hate golfing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to be the CEO of this </v>

1277
00:55:44.571 --> 00:55:45.470
<v Speaker 2>company will get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1278
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:48.050
<v Speaker 2>I went to work my way up the ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would take up golfing.</v>

1279
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:49.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter about your gender,</v>

1280
00:55:49.251 --> 00:55:50.960
<v Speaker 2>it matters about how well you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1281
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1282
00:55:52.811 --> 00:55:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1283
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:54.950
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a perfect system either,</v>

1284
00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:55.784
<v Speaker 2>but it's better than the alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>because one thing that people were out </v>

1285
00:55:58.590 --> 00:55:59.423
<v Speaker 2>of my quotes is as soon as you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminating in favor of someone </v>

1286
00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:04.340
<v Speaker 2>because of skin color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

1287
00:56:04.341 --> 00:56:05.174
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1288
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.680
<v Speaker 2>you will also discriminating against </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on those very same categories.</v>

1289
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>

1290
00:56:10.881 --> 00:56:12.320
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got a position here and we need to</v>

1291
00:56:12.321 --> 00:56:13.154
<v Speaker 2>hire a black woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're excluding people on the </v>

1292
00:56:15.201 --> 00:56:17.310
<v Speaker 2>basis of their race and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1293
00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't agree with that.</v>

1294
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:19.303
<v Speaker 2>I think that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm sure there are plenty of </v>

1295
00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>incredibly talented black women out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1296
00:56:24.131 --> 00:56:28.350
<v Speaker 2>therefore we don't need to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial adjustments.</v>

1297
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Surely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1298
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 2>and at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we go down this road,</v>

1299
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:34.990
<v Speaker 2>then when does it end?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

1300
00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:35.843
<v Speaker 2>where is the eventual logical goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually you come to a planned </v>

1301
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:39.610
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you can't,</v>

1302
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 2>you can't just have honor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1303
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.593
<v Speaker 2>you were going to hire by merit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you've got 10 different </v>

1304
00:56:45.701 --> 00:56:47.410
<v Speaker 2>categories you've got to go through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1305
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.460
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many trans people,</v>

1306
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Queer people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many black,</v>

1307
00:56:49.931 --> 00:56:50.764
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hispanic,</v>

1308
00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.080
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now you're talking about how good</v>

1309
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:53.914
<v Speaker 2>they are at their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're talking about the just </v>

1310
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.130
<v Speaker 2>operatory characteristics of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1311
00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.190
<v Speaker 2>And what happens when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if three people leave,</v>

1312
00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:01.024
<v Speaker 2>once you do three black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave your company and all you have </v>

1313
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:03.911
<v Speaker 2>applying for jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1314
00:57:03.911 --> 00:57:04.750
<v Speaker 2>white people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

1315
00:57:04.751 --> 00:57:05.720
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1316
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:07.930
<v Speaker 2>you're in a position where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>

1317
00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy.</v>

1318
00:57:09.001 --> 00:57:09.834
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quest for equality is being played </v>

1319
00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:18.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of on an unequal playing field and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just makes everybody kind of nuts.</v>

1320
00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1321
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I think nature really didn't have it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right when he,</v>

1322
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:23.160
<v Speaker 2>when he was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1323
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:26.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be careful when you're battling monsters</v>

1324
00:57:26.041 --> 00:57:27.900
<v Speaker 2>because when you stand along into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abyss,</v>

1325
00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.110
<v Speaker 2>the bissell sustains into you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

1326
00:57:30.111 --> 00:57:30.944
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you stand along into the sort of </v>

1327
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:36.060
<v Speaker 2>progressive mindset of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>terribly uneven,</v>

1328
00:57:36.061 --> 00:57:38.130
<v Speaker 2>it's an unequal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no opportunities for anyone.</v>

1329
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:39.023
<v Speaker 2>There's no ed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to do anything we can to help </v>

1330
00:57:41.251 --> 00:57:43.530
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then everything becomes justified.</v>

1331
00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:43.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1332
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:44.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1333
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.870
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter whose rights you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump alone,</v>

1334
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.930
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it for the greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what really scared.</v>

1335
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:50.343
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually a great segue to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about a little bit about </v>

1336
00:57:52.871 --> 00:57:54.630
<v Speaker 1>their tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think in the,</v>

1337
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 1>in the 45 minutes or so that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

1338
00:57:56.771 --> 00:58:00.760
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a lot about their ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're not fans of their ideas,</v>

1339
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:01.803
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's something more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pernicious going on here with some of </v>

1340
00:58:04.511 --> 00:58:05.344
<v Speaker 1>the tactics because I don't think it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>coincidence that many of the main </v>

1341
00:58:08.831 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 1>players in this regressive left </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

1342
00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been exposed to be liars,</v>

1343
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:17.470
<v Speaker 1>to be plagiarists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be frauds,</v>

1344
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:18.483
<v Speaker 1>to purposely manipulate people's words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create memes that are knowingly </v>

1345
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:27.670
<v Speaker 1>misquoted all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a coincidence.</v>

1346
00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Now you may disagree what with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sargon of Akkad says,</v>

1347
00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:33.034
<v Speaker 1>or what Dave Rubin says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you would find </v>

1348
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 1>instances where we maliciously </v>
<v Speaker 1>misrepresented people.</v>

1349
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:43.600
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose they're just their </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument if you really got them alone,</v>

1350
00:58:43.601 --> 00:58:45.490
<v Speaker 1>if you could really get an honest moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of them,</v>

1351
00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.820
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know you could get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose their argument would be,</v>

1352
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:49.654
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ends justify the means and that's </v>

1353
00:58:51.131 --> 00:58:53.080
<v Speaker 1>just the reverse of how I view the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1354
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1355
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.580
<v Speaker 2>that is honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

1356
00:58:56.581 --> 00:58:57.630
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1357
00:58:57.631 --> 00:59:00.040
<v Speaker 2>It's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the,</v>

1358
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:05.300
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to unpack here actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's these people are being primed in</v>

1359
00:59:05.431 --> 00:59:06.264
<v Speaker 2>universities to be activists and part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the priming is to give them a good </v>

1360
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:12.900
<v Speaker 2>feeling about doing this activism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1361
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:18.060
<v Speaker 2>it's to make them think that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally reward themselves by saying,</v>

1362
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I argued with a misogynist on twitter,</v>

1363
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:21.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1364
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.080
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding there.</v>

1365
00:59:24.081 --> 00:59:25.910
<v Speaker 2>That genuinely is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen feminist,</v>

1366
00:59:25.911 --> 00:59:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I've seen pictures of feminists courses </v>
<v Speaker 2>were on the wall.</v>

1367
00:59:28.611 --> 00:59:29.444
<v Speaker 2>They have a big twitter activism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism and stuff like this and it's </v>

1368
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:33.830
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1369
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're encouraged to be activists.</v>

1370
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:37.934
<v Speaker 2>They are encouraged to emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward themselves for being activists </v>

1371
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.880
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

1372
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you know like theory about never </v>
<v Speaker 1>argued with a twitter egg.</v>

1373
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.500
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm going to put on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>tombstone one day.</v>

1374
00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard that,</v>

1375
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.480
<v Speaker 2>but that's a good one because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1376
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:50.933
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care about ideas and not like people </v>

1377
00:59:52.351 --> 00:59:53.184
<v Speaker 2>are numbers so I can't wait when someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>would like five fullest as your role in </v>

1378
00:59:56.531 --> 00:59:57.840
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to argue the case.</v>

1379
00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I've got to stop out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1380
01:00:00.601 --> 01:00:02.130
<v Speaker 2>I might be a little more evolved than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1381
01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:04.590
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1382
01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.480
<v Speaker 2>what was I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1383
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>that at the schools that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1384
01:00:07.621 --> 01:00:08.454
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an intellectual incentive or </v>

1385
01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:11.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a feeling incentive.</v>

1386
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an emotional incentive and um,</v>

1387
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.153
<v Speaker 2>basically it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got to the point where they've </v>

1388
01:00:15.911 --> 01:00:16.744
<v Speaker 2>convinced themselves that progressive or</v>
<v Speaker 2>regressive ism is the only morally </v>

1389
01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:22.384
<v Speaker 2>legitimate position to hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyone not holding this position </v>

1390
01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:27.183
<v Speaker 2>must be a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's everything about </v>

1391
01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.340
<v Speaker 2>progressivism in a nutshell right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you a regressive,</v>

1392
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:34.223
<v Speaker 2>you are a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you owns sacrificing other people's </v>

1393
01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:37.864
<v Speaker 2>rights for the rights of a group that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know you've got no connection </v>

1394
01:00:41.081 --> 01:00:41.914
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have been emotionally primed to </v>

1395
01:00:43.661 --> 01:00:46.240
<v Speaker 2>fight for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're a bad person.</v>

1396
01:00:46.241 --> 01:00:49.380
<v Speaker 2>And so it's okay for me to call you all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these terrible labels.</v>

1397
01:00:49.381 --> 01:00:50.214
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1398
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you would have to be pretty damn racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to call you a racist,</v>

1399
01:00:54.071 --> 01:00:55.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad label.</v>

1400
01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:56.923
<v Speaker 2>It's a label with a lot of weight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet these people throw around as if it </v>

1401
01:00:59.471 --> 01:01:00.520
<v Speaker 2>means nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1402
01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:01.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1403
01:01:01.411 --> 01:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I always say that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I said this to you when I was on</v>

1404
01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>your show that my awakening had a lot to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with that whole Ben Affleck,</v>

1405
01:01:07.121 --> 01:01:07.954
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris thing on real time and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of what the craziness of was </v>

1406
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:12.303
<v Speaker 1>with that was that ben throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>racists so quickly that I agree with </v>

1407
01:01:16.811 --> 01:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take a lot.</v>

1408
01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.813
<v Speaker 1>It would take a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are obvious racist out there and </v>

1409
01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>they should be called out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were arguing with someone,</v>

1410
01:01:23.561 --> 01:01:27.910
<v Speaker 1>it would take a real special person for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to eliminate that.</v>

1411
01:01:27.911 --> 01:01:30.040
<v Speaker 1>They were racist within 30 seconds.</v>

1412
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:31.423
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1413
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:32.703
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that came straight out of the gate </v>

1414
01:01:34.131 --> 01:01:35.530
<v Speaker 2>with it or something and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1415
01:01:35.531 --> 01:01:37.080
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black people should be under,</v>

1416
01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.890
<v Speaker 2>shipped off the cotton plantations or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1417
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:39.231
<v Speaker 2>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1418
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:40.970
<v Speaker 2>well you're a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on the blood,</v>

1419
01:01:40.971 --> 01:01:42.580
<v Speaker 2>well I wouldn't call myself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1420
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:47.180
<v Speaker 2>but some of these things normally hold a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of weights and the.</v>

1421
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.673
<v Speaker 2>And that's the reason they use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use labels as weapons and they did </v>

1422
01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:52.580
<v Speaker 2>it for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a couple of reasons.</v>

1423
01:01:52.581 --> 01:01:54.050
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first one obviously is to put you on</v>

1424
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:54.884
<v Speaker 2>the back foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you're called a racist or </v>

1425
01:01:56.391 --> 01:02:00.050
<v Speaker 2>homophobic or bigger or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're defending yourself.</v>

1426
01:02:00.051 --> 01:02:02.630
<v Speaker 2>You're not defending your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not attacking their ideas.</v>

1427
01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:04.310
<v Speaker 2>You're defending yourself as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1428
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.273
<v Speaker 2>that's in itself a logical fallacy </v>
<v Speaker 2>called an ad hominem attack the person </v>

1429
01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:08.924
<v Speaker 2>rather than the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you will find that they do this a </v>

1430
01:02:10.851 --> 01:02:11.630
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

1431
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:12.710
<v Speaker 2>So basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1432
01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:17.711
<v Speaker 2>The answer to this is to just say in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your opinion on the end of it,</v>

1433
01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.170
<v Speaker 2>so they'll say you're a racist and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1434
01:02:19.171 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your opinion,</v>

1435
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they'll say,</v>

1436
01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:23.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a racist or sexist or bigoted.</v>

1437
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 2>So in your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1438
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not lots and I know him and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've said would make any reasonable</v>

1439
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:30.773
<v Speaker 2>person thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you other nodal reasonable person </v>

1440
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.120
<v Speaker 2>and therefore you're going to label me </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a racist or a bigot or whatever.</v>

1441
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.520
<v Speaker 2>And honestly what you've just given me </v>
<v Speaker 2>is your opinion.</v>

1442
01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:39.354
<v Speaker 2>It's not an objective statement of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when they use the word </v>

1443
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:42.630
<v Speaker 2>programmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>

1444
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:43.960
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's problematic.</v>

1445
01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:44.794
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1446
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.450
<v Speaker 2>can you explain to me what programmatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>means?</v>

1447
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:48.930
<v Speaker 2>Immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it mean wrong?</v>

1448
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1449
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:51.203
<v Speaker 2>It means transgressive to progressivism </v>
<v Speaker 2>with feminism and it's basically the </v>

1450
01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:59.700
<v Speaker 2>same as sinful in the Catholic church or</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same as in Islam,</v>

1451
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:00.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1452
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:01.243
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is transgressive to my ideology is </v>

1453
01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.630
<v Speaker 2>something wrong and it's not an </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective statement of fact.</v>

1454
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like what you've done.</v>

1455
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that I,</v>

1456
01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:11.243
<v Speaker 1>I love that because it goes to show that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want in a certain intellectual or </v>

1457
01:03:14.971 --> 01:03:15.804
<v Speaker 1>ideological purity and that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Church would want out of your or any </v>

1458
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>sort of authoritarian view would want an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual and ideological peer,</v>

1459
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 1>not intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purely ideological purity.</v>

1460
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>It's usually not that intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1461
01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:28.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1462
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:31.620
<v Speaker 1>They want an ideological ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>purity out of you.</v>

1463
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And what that does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1464
01:03:33.211 --> 01:03:34.044
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing this right now in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic debate last week between </v>

1465
01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:37.973
<v Speaker 1>Bernie and Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were arguing over who's the bigger </v>

1466
01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:41.310
<v Speaker 1>progressive and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

1467
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.230
<v Speaker 1>that's not what the fight should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1468
01:03:43.231 --> 01:03:45.090
<v Speaker 1>It should be about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on the left,</v>

1469
01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:48.120
<v Speaker 1>it should be about who is standing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for liberal principles,</v>

1470
01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:48.954
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not who fits this narrow definition </v>

1471
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:51.744
<v Speaker 1>because guess what then all you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've said a zillion times in your </v>

1472
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the debate over to the right and</v>

1473
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:58.150
<v Speaker 2>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet Donald Trump,</v>

1474
01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.000
<v Speaker 2>the steering in their own juices there </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1475
01:04:01.001 --> 01:04:02.320
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm the biggest procrastinator.</v>

1476
01:04:02.321 --> 01:04:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Salute you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to.</v>

1477
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:05.223
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to worry about convincing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people about who's the bigger </v>

1478
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.330
<v Speaker 2>progressive progressive's aren't going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to vote for you.</v>

1479
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:10.223
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals are the people you want to </v>

1480
01:04:11.471 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 2>commence on the swing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Voters who are dying,</v>

1481
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:14.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>died in the more progressive than the </v>

1482
01:04:15.701 --> 01:04:16.800
<v Speaker 2>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1483
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:18.160
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who concerned about issues.</v>

1484
01:04:18.161 --> 01:04:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said about policies,</v>

1485
01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can send about what you're actually </v>

1486
01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:22.250
<v Speaker 2>going to do rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1487
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:25.470
<v Speaker 2>ideological Brownie points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

1488
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just this little circle jerk with a</v>

1489
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.233
<v Speaker 2>student or an ideology for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand how they're being </v>

1490
01:04:31.391 --> 01:04:32.224
<v Speaker 2>viewed from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let you said it's driving people to </v>

1491
01:04:33.671 --> 01:04:34.504
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1492
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:35.950
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely driving people.</v>

1493
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>So then what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

1494
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Because that is not us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1495
01:04:40.331 --> 01:04:43.240
<v Speaker 1>We're the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the ones that are trying to defend</v>

1496
01:04:43.241 --> 01:04:44.074
<v Speaker 1>classical liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you get tons of emails and </v>

1497
01:04:47.021 --> 01:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>tweets and all that stuff that I get all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time about.</v>

1498
01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I see this split,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has happened.</v>

1499
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.553
<v Speaker 1>I get people telling me they're afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and embarrassed to call themselves on </v>

1500
01:04:56.231 --> 01:04:57.064
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get other people saying they won't </v>

1501
01:04:58.271 --> 01:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>post things on facebook because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to get called a racist.</v>

1502
01:05:01.301 --> 01:05:02.134
<v Speaker 1>So all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's this growing group of </v>

1503
01:05:03.911 --> 01:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which there absolutely is,</v>

1504
01:05:05.351 --> 01:05:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1505
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.033
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do to keep this message </v>

1506
01:05:10.421 --> 01:05:11.254
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>

1507
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1508
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:13.463
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the great thing about what's </v>

1509
01:05:14.521 --> 01:05:18.670
<v Speaker 2>happening is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because,</v>

1510
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1511
01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>you had Milo Yiannopoulos on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

1512
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:25.090
<v Speaker 2>he was the only journalist who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared to cover gamergate initially.</v>

1513
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:26.373
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've grown to become friends with them </v>

1514
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.990
<v Speaker 2>and people find it really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1515
01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:29.824
<v Speaker 2>because he's a conservative and I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal and I just tried to explain to </v>

1516
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>them that look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1517
01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.293
<v Speaker 2>we've come to the point where it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really about political affiliation to </v>

1518
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:38.683
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about whether we can agree on </v>

1519
01:05:40.511 --> 01:05:41.620
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1520
01:05:41.621 --> 01:05:44.940
<v Speaker 2>we can interpret this reality and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>our own opinions in any way.</v>

1521
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:46.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that he's got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions,</v>

1522
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.193
<v Speaker 2>things that I disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if we can agree that the numbers are </v>

1523
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.190
<v Speaker 2>such that the events are as follows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1524
01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>whereas the progressive left will lie to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1525
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.090
<v Speaker 2>They will lie to themselves like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we said that will cherry pick their</v>

1526
01:05:58.091 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll choose several data points,</v>

1527
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.470
<v Speaker 2>leave out the ones that contradict what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've said,</v>

1528
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:04.660
<v Speaker 2>and then if you don't agree with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

1529
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:07.200
<v Speaker 2>they consider you persona non grata.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1530
01:06:07.201 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1531
01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>you may as well be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1532
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>bill o'reilly or something like that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that month.</v>

1533
01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Just to be very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not just,</v>

1534
01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.990
<v Speaker 1>you're not just saying something for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sake of saying it.</v>

1535
01:06:15.991 --> 01:06:16.824
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have literally seen this happen to me </v>

1536
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:20.550
<v Speaker 1>just to be very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1537
01:06:20.551 --> 01:06:23.790
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly what's happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I now wear as a badge of pride,</v>

1538
01:06:23.791 --> 01:06:24.624
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1539
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1540
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:27.300
<v Speaker 2>let.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things when you first</v>

1541
01:06:27.301 --> 01:06:29.550
<v Speaker 2>introduce people to this and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know anything about sales.</v>

1542
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.810
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1543
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 2>they protect themselves with audacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I,</v>

1544
01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:37.363
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of military history and </v>
<v Speaker 2>audacity is one of those things that </v>

1545
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.313
<v Speaker 2>wins many wars because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected and I really think that the </v>

1546
01:06:43.531 --> 01:06:44.364
<v Speaker 2>things they do are so audacious that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to persuade people that </v>

1547
01:06:47.581 --> 01:06:49.770
<v Speaker 2>genuinely doing them because people hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and think,</v>

1548
01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:51.790
<v Speaker 2>I would never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1549
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:52.830
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1550
01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine anyone doing it.</v>

1551
01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.450
<v Speaker 2>That's not happening your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1552
01:06:57.451 --> 01:06:58.284
<v Speaker 2>and they think that the person relating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the information is the one telling the </v>

1553
01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:02.240
<v Speaker 2>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the progressives,</v>

1554
01:07:02.241 --> 01:07:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1555
01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.490
<v Speaker 2>they really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really take a couple this and say,</v>

1556
01:07:05.491 --> 01:07:07.890
<v Speaker 2>well that's because he's a racist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist and all these things.</v>

1557
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.023
<v Speaker 2>And then the person that has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience them acting as they act to </v>

1558
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.220
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had so many people come back and we</v>

1559
01:07:14.221 --> 01:07:15.054
<v Speaker 2>get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were full of nonsense </v>

1560
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:17.400
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1561
01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.040
<v Speaker 2>when I first had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was exactly how they are.</v>

1562
01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Exactly how they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1563
01:07:21.601 --> 01:07:22.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you honestly,</v>

1564
01:07:22.801 --> 01:07:23.910
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1565
01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.320
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1566
01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:24.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1567
01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:26.040
<v Speaker 2>no harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no foul sort of thing.</v>

1568
01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:26.874
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens to everyone because at first </v>

1569
01:07:28.501 --> 01:07:30.390
<v Speaker 2>when you first hear it sounds like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense,</v>

1570
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't believe anyone would act this </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1571
01:07:32.401 --> 01:07:33.234
<v Speaker 2>And yet they do.</v>

1572
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.413
<v Speaker 1>Do you sometimes think that maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best way to beat them at this point is </v>

1573
01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:40.390
<v Speaker 1>just to ignore them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think over the last six months</v>

1574
01:07:40.391 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 1>between what we do here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>

1575
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:43.923
<v Speaker 1>what many other people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the digital space now and </v>

1576
01:07:46.871 --> 01:07:48.940
<v Speaker 1>what Bill Maher has done a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more in the mainstream,</v>

1577
01:07:48.941 --> 01:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>there's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been exposed and I think because</v>

1578
01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:54.730
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stewing in their juices now.</v>

1579
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Part of me is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1580
01:07:56.010 --> 01:07:58.180
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just ignore them and then,</v>

1581
01:07:58.181 --> 01:07:59.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's another piece of me that </v>

1582
01:07:59.831 --> 01:08:03.010
<v Speaker 1>says we have to keep on the attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which do you think would be a better,</v>

1583
01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:03.973
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1584
01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.560
<v Speaker 2>offering them as a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactic?</v>

1585
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1586
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.983
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is that you have </v>

1587
01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:13.940
<v Speaker 2>the initiative to them and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1588
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna pay attention,</v>

1589
01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.910
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what you're doing.</v>

1590
01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.073
<v Speaker 2>And therefore whatever it is they do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really aware of and suddenly </v>

1591
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.090
<v Speaker 2>something will come at you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not prepared for.</v>

1592
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:24.223
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it gives them the ground to </v>

1593
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:30.770
<v Speaker 2>continue propagating their ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>position that gets them,</v>

1594
01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:31.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1595
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.070
<v Speaker 2>there's no resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1596
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1597
01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.930
<v Speaker 2>it own twists a yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll eat it.</v>

1598
01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's little resistance.</v>

1599
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>But like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get a group,</v>

1600
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.240
<v Speaker 2>a little delegation of progressives who </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to a place and they say,</v>

1601
01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.103
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd like to talk to you about women's </v>

1602
01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.550
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you call it,</v>

1603
01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know.</v>

1604
01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:50.930
<v Speaker 2>And so your boss might like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1605
01:08:50.931 --> 01:08:51.680
<v Speaker 2>he's just a good guy.</v>

1606
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.780
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

1607
01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1608
01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll do whatever I can.</v>

1609
01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:55.124
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly these people are now </v>

1610
01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:57.374
<v Speaker 2>advising the upper echelons of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>company and then they stopped enforcing </v>

1611
01:09:01.491 --> 01:09:05.510
<v Speaker 2>ideological conformity and then suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in this position where,</v>

1612
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:06.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean this happened to major game </v>
<v Speaker 2>studios has happened to like games </v>

1613
01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:10.050
<v Speaker 2>workshop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there,</v>

1614
01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of people who have fallen</v>

1615
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:17.981
<v Speaker 2>prey to the velvet glove of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice that contains within it the iron</v>

1616
01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:21.470
<v Speaker 2>fist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just really well hidden.</v>

1617
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:23.220
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we can just,</v>

1618
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.493
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to fight them when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to show people that there is a </v>

1619
01:09:26.571 --> 01:09:29.480
<v Speaker 2>better alternative knots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eternal point you've,</v>

1620
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:31.640
<v Speaker 2>you've got to provide a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>

1621
01:09:31.641 --> 01:09:34.130
<v Speaker 2>And universal liberal principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

1622
01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:37.610
<v Speaker 2>are the highest alternative there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't anything better.</v>

1623
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.960
<v Speaker 2>You can't get anything more fair than </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal liberal principles.</v>

1624
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.913
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think just just pushing </v>

1625
01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:45.884
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1626
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:46.723
<v Speaker 2>showing people these are the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do things in this not only encourages </v>

1627
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 2>equal treatment of people into the law </v>
<v Speaker 2>and any kind of social situation,</v>

1628
01:09:54.381 --> 01:09:55.214
<v Speaker 2>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also pushes people to be the best </v>

1629
01:09:57.261 --> 01:09:59.570
<v Speaker 2>that they can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't encourage them to be victims,</v>

1630
01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.910
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't hurt them to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be depressed and to,</v>

1631
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.150
<v Speaker 2>to milk it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1632
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:05.203
<v Speaker 2>there's no room for fraud when you come </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these sorts of meritocratic </v>

1633
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.860
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have to work,</v>

1634
01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:11.780
<v Speaker 2>they have to push themselves and become </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1635
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's about raising the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition rather than dragging it down,</v>

1636
01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.180
<v Speaker 2>which is everything about regressing.</v>

1637
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:18.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well naturally I believe in what you're </v>

1638
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:21.500
<v Speaker 1>saying and that's why I'm doing what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
