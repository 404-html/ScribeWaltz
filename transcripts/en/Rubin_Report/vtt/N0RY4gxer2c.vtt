1
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.923
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I'm most amazed by at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment is how the ideas and issues </v>

2
00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>that we're talking about every week here</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Rubin report are relevant,</v>

3
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>not just in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all over the world.</v>

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.950
<v Speaker 1>The amount of email I'm getting from you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys across the globe,</v>

5
00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

6
00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hungrier.</v>

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.033
<v Speaker 1>Japan is actually staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really seems to me that there has </v>

8
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>been a real awakening as to what being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>free human being is all about.</v>

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>You are in charge of your own life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start with this simple premise,</v>

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.293
<v Speaker 1>you can accomplish anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the discourse on social media may </v>

11
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:35.624
<v Speaker 1>seem more toxic than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a growing dynamic group of people </v>

12
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.194
<v Speaker 1>coming together through ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation regardless of where they </v>

13
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>were born or the color of their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're partnering with learn liberty this</v>

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>week and our guest is Rajshree Agarwal.</v>

15
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.603
<v Speaker 1>She was born in India to a traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>family only move to America where she </v>

16
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:53.804
<v Speaker 1>now teaches about capitalism at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Maryland where she is the </v>

17
00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:58.274
<v Speaker 1>chair and professor of entrepreneurship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She believes that capitalism provides </v>

18
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>maximum freedom and happiness to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>people regardless of race,</v>

19
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything else,</v>

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.713
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of freedom that one sparked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>her as a young child or the same ideas </v>

21
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>that she's now helping further by </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching minds of young people today.</v>

22
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.073
<v Speaker 1>That is what freedom is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to join me in spreading </v>

23
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>these ideas of freedom and individuality</v>
<v Speaker 1>in person,</v>

24
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Speaker 1>I will be joining Jordan Peterson on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life tour for as many dates</v>

25
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>as I can possibly fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kicked off the tour a couple of weeks</v>

26
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.213
<v Speaker 1>ago at the beacon in New York City where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy in the room was absolutely </v>

27
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:34.694
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be traveling with Jordan to the UK </v>

28
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>to speak in London at the Apollo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hammersmith Theater on May 13th,</v>

29
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:41.204
<v Speaker 1>and then on May 14th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the incredible honor of speaking </v>

30
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>at the Oxford Union.</v>

31
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.853
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully I'll get to meet as many you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys as possible and I also promised to </v>

32
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.933
<v Speaker 1>down as many points as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also working on an Australian tour </v>

33
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 1>and hope to have some more info on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you guys soon.</v>

34
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.753
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've mentioned on the show lately that </v>

35
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>the endless hysteria of the left and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically correct craziness that we're</v>

36
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:02.444
<v Speaker 1>caught up and was eventually going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drag me back into standup comedy and </v>

37
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>this finally came to fruition this past </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday at the Irvine Improv.</v>

38
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.393
<v Speaker 1>The show is billed as an evening of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up and sit down as I did about an </v>

39
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.443
<v Speaker 1>hour of standup and then Bob Saget </v>
<v Speaker 1>joined me on stage for about 45 minutes </v>

40
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 1>of a sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

41
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Meeting so many you guys out there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show was a huge success.</v>

42
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>The manager of the Improv even told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was the first sold out,</v>

43
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>standing ovation.</v>

44
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 1>She seen at the club in her 18 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to announce travel dates for</v>

45
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:32.954
<v Speaker 1>upcoming standup gigs pretty soon and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope that you guys will join me for at </v>

46
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>least a two drink minimum and plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughs.</v>

47
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after years in the making,</v>

48
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:41.234
<v Speaker 1>we taped our interview with Dr Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soul yesterday on location at Stanford </v>

49
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.033
<v Speaker 1>University in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We flew our whole team up there and </v>

50
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:48.824
<v Speaker 1>rented a studio to make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was truly a personal and career </v>

51
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>highlight for me and I can't wait to </v>
<v Speaker 1>share our sit down with you next week.</v>

52
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Big thanks to our supporters on Patrion </v>
<v Speaker 1>who make interviews like this,</v>

53
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.970
<v Speaker 1>so all these announcements aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether a year in the US,</v>

54
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxford,</v>

55
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anywhere else,</v>

56
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.963
<v Speaker 1>we're all in this fight together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep fighting for what you believe in </v>

57
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.743
<v Speaker 1>and I'll do the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're continuing our partnership with </v>

58
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:21.720
<v Speaker 1>learn liberty today and joining me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the root of p lamone chair and professor</v>

59
00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:26.721
<v Speaker 1>of entrepreneurship at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland as well as the director for the</v>

60
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Economics.</v>

61
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Rajshree Agarwal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

62
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave.</v>

63
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.023
<v Speaker 1>I feel we're going to have a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk because we've already sort of had </v>

64
00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:40.820
<v Speaker 1>the interview before we started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing it already.</v>

65
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to this because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did meet once before we were at a </v>

66
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>conference in DC that was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on academia and free speech and</v>

67
00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 1>we spent a couple of minutes talking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I thought was interesting.</v>

68
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:55.574
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you knew who I was </v>

69
00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:57.074
<v Speaker 1>beforehand and that I didn't know who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were before hand and they sort of </v>

70
00:03:59.481 --> 00:04:00.314
<v Speaker 1>brought me there to talk a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how youtube plays a part in </v>

71
00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:07.100
<v Speaker 1>reaching young people and technology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that and you were very interested in</v>

72
00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:09.650
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't really focus on free speech</v>

73
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:10.484
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we focused on how technology is </v>

74
00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:16.520
<v Speaker 1>shifting the conversation a so just very</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly to start,</v>

75
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.760
<v Speaker 1>why are you interested in how technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>is affecting the conversation related to</v>

76
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.460
<v Speaker 1>free speech capitalism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>

77
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.140
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not interested in technology per </v>
<v Speaker 2>se,</v>

78
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.753
<v Speaker 2>but I'm interested in technology because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it represents the manifestation of the </v>

79
00:04:36.411 --> 00:04:39.380
<v Speaker 2>human mind at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

80
00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:43.130
<v Speaker 2>what is technology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technology is better machines,</v>

81
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.083
<v Speaker 2>but what our machines ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they are fast computers or </v>

82
00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:52.601
<v Speaker 2>whether they're the industrialized age </v>
<v Speaker 2>engines or whatever you call it,</v>

83
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.953
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are ways for us humans to make our </v>

84
00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:58.124
<v Speaker 2>lives easier by using machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So technology ultimately is a way for </v>

85
00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:04.544
<v Speaker 2>humans to communicate better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live better lives and to use their </v>

86
00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:11.780
<v Speaker 2>mind in doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I study innovation.</v>

87
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.673
<v Speaker 2>I study technology because it enables us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the best we can be by using our </v>

88
00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

89
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.933
<v Speaker 1>I was very proud when you walked in here</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you study innovation and </v>

90
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship and this is my garage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we turned into a studio.</v>

91
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:25.684
<v Speaker 1>So I thought</v>

92
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.973
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and think about all of the creativity </v>

93
00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:31.230
<v Speaker 2>that went into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

94
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Not just by you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of the thing,</v>

95
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 2>all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the techniques the machines had,</v>

96
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:37.594
<v Speaker 2>we're looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was someone's mind that had to come </v>

97
00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:43.550
<v Speaker 2>up with it first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So creativity,</v>

98
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 2>which is at the heart of individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>enterprise is what I love.</v>

99
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I study.</v>

100
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're going to spend most</v>

101
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>of this hour talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

102
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.104
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we do these shows with learn </v>

103
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.724
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always send me just a quick one </v>

104
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>page bio and everybody and I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved years.</v>

105
00:05:58.371 --> 00:05:59.640
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of quotes in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

106
00:05:59.641 --> 00:06:02.470
<v Speaker 1>that I want to quote directly to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.390
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

108
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.223
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when they asked me to write that </v>

109
00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:06.084
<v Speaker 2>bio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dish that out in about 15 minutes at </v>

110
00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:11.490
<v Speaker 2>4:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>

111
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you patting yourself on the back</v>

112
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.900
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

113
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.923
<v Speaker 1>this was really good when you got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first let's talk a little bit about </v>

114
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>your history because you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting history.</v>

115
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You were born in India and you lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for that,</v>

116
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>for your first 21 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit about that.</v>

117
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

118
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I was born to a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very traditional family,</v>

119
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.573
<v Speaker 2>Hindu family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father was your typical rags to </v>

120
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:42.340
<v Speaker 2>riches entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He embodied enterprise and he,</v>

121
00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you about this one story.</v>

122
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.403
<v Speaker 2>I was in fifth grade and I came home so </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset because the history lesson that I </v>

123
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:56.290
<v Speaker 2>had just heard was all about how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United Kingdom,</v>

124
00:06:56.291 --> 00:07:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Britain came in and just plundered his </v>
<v Speaker 2>Golden Pico.</v>

125
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.233
<v Speaker 2>That was Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at all the nasty things that they </v>

126
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:06.130
<v Speaker 2>did to us and how oppressed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>victimized we were.</v>

127
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.173
<v Speaker 2>And my father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a very much a traditional </v>

128
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox Hindu at that time said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

129
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.440
<v Speaker 2>actually Britain did more good for India</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they did bad.</v>

130
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.210
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

131
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.583
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went on to talk about why before </v>

132
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.910
<v Speaker 2>that it's true that India was rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does rich mean?</v>

133
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.690
<v Speaker 2>It meant that the kings and the traders </v>
<v Speaker 2>were rich,</v>

134
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.080
<v Speaker 2>but then also very feudalist economy at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

135
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.530
<v Speaker 2>And of course they were also very </v>
<v Speaker 2>balconies because each of these kingdoms</v>

136
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:39.364
<v Speaker 2>were fighting with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that he talked </v>

137
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:45.100
<v Speaker 2>about is how the advent of the British,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

138
00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>they bought the rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bought infrastructure,</v>

139
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:49.570
<v Speaker 2>they gave us English as a language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

140
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:50.950
<v Speaker 2>often people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my husband says,</v>

141
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk better English than I do.</v>

142
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

143
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.730
<v Speaker 2>that's because I was educated in English</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

144
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time that he was such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur in his mindset,</v>

145
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 2>he was very traditionalist in his views </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how a woman should be.</v>

146
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.620
<v Speaker 2>And so when I was 12 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said to me,</v>

147
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.660
<v Speaker 2>the right and the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>finding a husband for you is mine,</v>

148
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.123
<v Speaker 2>don't you forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course any woman in his family </v>

149
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.953
<v Speaker 2>couldn't work because that was a slap on</v>
<v Speaker 2>his face in his ability to provide for </v>

150
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:27.010
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

151
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.843
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about it at 12 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old and being told that the two biggest </v>

152
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:33.214
<v Speaker 2>decisions any individual can make for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves who you marry and what you </v>

153
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 2>choose to work in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

154
00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tell you know,</v>

155
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think that those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions under grid,</v>

156
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.560
<v Speaker 2>everything that we do both at work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not work life that we live.</v>

157
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.053
<v Speaker 2>If those are taken away from you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean about you as an </v>

158
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 2>individual?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You as a person.</v>

159
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.183
<v Speaker 2>So between 12 and 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to navigate that distance because </v>

160
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 2>at 12 years old I was a daddy's girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

161
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

162
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:06.744
<v Speaker 2>just please do me a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find me a husband who lives in Bombay </v>

163
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.543
<v Speaker 2>because I can't even bear the thought of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in a city that's different from </v>

164
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at 18 I had to see for myself that I</v>

165
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.224
<v Speaker 2>couldn't renege on that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so between 18 and 21 was really my </v>

166
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 2>discovery of who I wanted to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at 21 I left India,</v>

167
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 2>two suitcases in my hand left everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I loved,</v>

168
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.383
<v Speaker 2>a very generous inheritance and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>father did not speak to me for seven </v>

169
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:37.374
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

170
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

171
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>there's so much there of your formative </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that,</v>

172
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 1>that leads you to where you're at right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

173
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.220
<v Speaker 1>When you came home that day in fifth </v>
<v Speaker 1>grade,</v>

174
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.143
<v Speaker 1>you learned something in school and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear something different from your </v>

175
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>father who you obviously respected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>admired and had,</v>

176
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.583
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rags to riches had provided a good life </v>

177
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:57.864
<v Speaker 1>for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you go back to school after </v>

178
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:00.391
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

179
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 1>did you go back and start arguing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers?</v>

180
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always arguing with.</v>

181
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.030
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

182
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I remember my science teacher saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rajshree,</v>

183
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 2>why do you ask so many wise?</v>

184
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure that's not what a science </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher.</v>

185
00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:19.520
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really fascinating.</v>

186
00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:23.810
<v Speaker 1>So you picked up and left and left an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inheritance.</v>

187
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:26.000
<v Speaker 1>All of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to America.</v>

188
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Just tell me a little bit about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>initial experience.</v>

189
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.800
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

190
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.590
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

192
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.820
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

193
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.790
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:39.624
<v Speaker 2>I had lived in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the generation that I was </v>

195
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:43.614
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A woman didn't go or a woman did not </v>

196
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:47.300
<v Speaker 2>live by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

197
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 2>The God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stayed with their parents still.</v>

198
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 2>They were married and then they went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their husband's house.</v>

199
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.083
<v Speaker 2>So the concept of really being yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and having the responsibility to make </v>

200
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:01.614
<v Speaker 2>your own choices is both liberating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I also realized I can't blame </v>

201
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:09.230
<v Speaker 2>my parents were my mistakes anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed.</v>

202
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years later I've been my mom,</v>

203
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Speaker 2>or six years later when my mom came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>visit with us,</v>

204
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:16.920
<v Speaker 2>my husband said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

205
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 2>what is the one biggest difference that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen your daughter?</v>

206
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 2>And this will tell you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about my personality there too.</v>

207
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 2>She says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's become very responsible.</v>

208
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating guy.</v>

209
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>And she's uses this as evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

210
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:33.534
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are her father used to give her a very </v>

211
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 2>generous allowance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were,</v>

212
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.693
<v Speaker 2>we would marvel at the fact that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid would go through this allowance </v>

213
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:46.194
<v Speaker 2>within 10 or 12 days and then she'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like more and then her father would </v>

214
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 2>sometimes give it and sometimes there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

215
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.343
<v Speaker 2>that's all you're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then come to me or she'd come to her </v>

216
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:55.624
<v Speaker 2>brother or I started to Taylor because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>often said I owned my own bread and </v>

217
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:00.124
<v Speaker 2>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my father provided we met with the </v>

218
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:03.350
<v Speaker 2>jam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

219
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

220
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.043
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that she said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now she looks at me and she's realized </v>

221
00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:09.644
<v Speaker 2>is just how responsible that become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That where before money would just flow </v>

222
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 2>off of my fingers and I wouldn't give it</v>
<v Speaker 2>a second thought.</v>

223
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:17.643
<v Speaker 2>I had become so much more responsible in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thinking and I think she was talking </v>

224
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot more about than just money in </v>
<v Speaker 2>India.</v>

225
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 2>I was rebelling because I was fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>against something.</v>

226
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I came to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to fight against anything.</v>

227
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.693
<v Speaker 2>So I had to figure out who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I really wanted to be and it </v>

228
00:12:36.841 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 2>allowed me to thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned you didn't talk to your</v>

229
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:43.810
<v Speaker 2>father for seven years after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had the reconciliation it or was it a</v>

230
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 2>reconciliation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reconciliation?</v>

231
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I really,</v>

232
00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:50.330
<v Speaker 2>really treasure is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

233
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

234
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:57.060
<v Speaker 2>I was a daddy's girl and I did want his </v>
<v Speaker 2>approval and after I got my phd,</v>

235
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:59.374
<v Speaker 2>I remember this one conversation that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had with him where I was the prodigal </v>

236
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 2>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just finally talking to me again.</v>

237
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:06.154
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd given up on the fact that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be this person that would </v>

238
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 2>ultimately come home with my tail </v>
<v Speaker 2>between my legs and say,</v>

239
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were right.</v>

240
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just completely given up on that.</v>

241
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.640
<v Speaker 2>And so he was listening to me and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course I was trying to impress him.</v>

242
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.053
<v Speaker 2>So I was talking to him about all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these achievements as a young assistant </v>

243
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:26.890
<v Speaker 2>professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had received a couple of awards.</v>

244
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 2>I was getting to go to these prestigious</v>
<v Speaker 2>conferences and he's listening,</v>

245
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 2>but there's silence on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the more I'm talking,</v>

246
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:38.400
<v Speaker 2>the more he silent and then finally I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just gave up.</v>

247
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I had nothing more to brag about or talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about and I wasn't getting the.</v>

248
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:43.893
<v Speaker 2>I'm so proud of you from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there was this uncomfortable </v>

249
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:51.811
<v Speaker 2>silence after which he says it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase in Hindi which roughly translated</v>

250
00:13:53.201 --> 00:13:58.201
<v Speaker 2>says if a peacock dances in a forest who</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees.</v>

251
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 2>So who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his point to me was,</v>

252
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 2>you can be all of the peacock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

253
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 2>but if you're not next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean anything.</v>

254
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.120
<v Speaker 2>So that was the harshness that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>started off with,</v>

255
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.450
<v Speaker 2>even in the reconciliation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my last visit with him paradoxically</v>

256
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 2>was when I was asked to give a keynote </v>
<v Speaker 2>in India.</v>

257
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 2>This was immediately after India's </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalization.</v>

258
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 2>It was trying as an economy that we now </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it to be.</v>

259
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.613
<v Speaker 2>And so I was asked to give a keynote at </v>
<v Speaker 2>an academic conference on </v>

260
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.180
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurship and economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on my way to this conference,</v>

261
00:14:37.181 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 2>I stopped by and 10 years after I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>done my phd,</v>

262
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm finally talking to my father about </v>
<v Speaker 2>my research and connecting it to his own</v>

263
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.153
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial spirit and him being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>serial entrepreneur and I can finally </v>

264
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:52.934
<v Speaker 2>see the pride in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got there and then add the keynote at </v>

265
00:14:57.741 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 2>the end of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go to India,</v>

266
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you realize that when you give a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will give you a present.</v>

267
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:04.183
<v Speaker 2>So in front of about 500 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give me this president that I </v>

268
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 2>opened and believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a peacock.</v>

269
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:12.423
<v Speaker 1>Seems fitting seems there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and it's so obvious hearing this </v>

270
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:16.484
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it led to all of the things that </v>

271
00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:18.834
<v Speaker 1>you're teaching about now and care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept between the battle between </v>

272
00:15:21.931 --> 00:15:22.764
<v Speaker 1>sort of traditionalism and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial spirit is really a </v>

273
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:30.420
<v Speaker 1>fascinating one because he obviously had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

274
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he built something for himself,</v>

275
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.670
<v Speaker 1>built a good life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then still wanted that piece of sort</v>

276
00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:39.300
<v Speaker 1>of the old world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we all kind of struggle with</v>

277
00:15:39.301 --> 00:15:40.134
<v Speaker 1>that in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what the struggle of </v>

278
00:15:41.461 --> 00:15:43.500
<v Speaker 1>western civilization is and stuff.</v>

279
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.313
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that this relates to </v>
<v Speaker 2>often the need to think and integrate </v>

280
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.673
<v Speaker 2>one psychological growth with one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth in the material and in the </v>

281
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.473
<v Speaker 2>Richard Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I think my </v>

282
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.503
<v Speaker 2>father was as a paradox unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that caused him as well as </v>

283
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.750
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of this angsty between us,</v>

284
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:19.050
<v Speaker 2>is that at the same time that he applied</v>
<v Speaker 2>his intellect into the economic realm,</v>

285
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.180
<v Speaker 2>he psychologically did not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that,</v>

286
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason he was successful is </v>

287
00:16:28.211 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Speaker 2>because he was able to make his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions,</v>

288
00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:32.284
<v Speaker 2>which also meant the freedom to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own mistakes and learn from your </v>

289
00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:36.544
<v Speaker 2>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why he allowed that there as far as </v>

290
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.210
<v Speaker 2>family was concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this very protectionist,</v>

291
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.283
<v Speaker 2>I need to take care of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that I'm realizing this as a parent </v>

292
00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:48.994
<v Speaker 2>is not very conducive to your children's</v>
<v Speaker 2>growth because what you really need to </v>

293
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:55.054
<v Speaker 2>give them are the tools to make their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own decisions as opposed to telling </v>

294
00:16:59.261 --> 00:17:00.370
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

295
00:17:00.371 --> 00:17:01.710
<v Speaker 2>this is the way you should do it.</v>

296
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ironically,</v>

297
00:17:03.241 --> 00:17:06.000
<v Speaker 1>had you not broken away and been free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

298
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:06.893
<v Speaker 1>although he may have been very pleased </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your life and who knows what your </v>

299
00:17:08.911 --> 00:17:09.744
<v Speaker 1>life would be and maybe you maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be happy in some ways it wouldn't </v>

300
00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:15.380
<v Speaker 1>have led you to all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you had to directly have to do that.</v>

301
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.973
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one more thing about India before we </v>

302
00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:20.130
<v Speaker 1>move on to everything else that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

303
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.190
<v Speaker 1>A I told you right before we started </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can a ton of fan mail from India.</v>

304
00:17:23.191 --> 00:17:24.024
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>political things happening right there </v>

305
00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:29.220
<v Speaker 1>that seemed to be driving people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching shows like this.</v>

306
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Just give me one thing that we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about India right now that maybe we</v>

307
00:17:33.601 --> 00:17:34.434
<v Speaker 1>don't know as Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is probably probably </v>

308
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 1>everything because India never comes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the new Israeli.</v>

309
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.073
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can talk about India right now a </v>

310
00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:44.814
<v Speaker 2>little less than I can talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>India that I grew up in and why growing </v>

311
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 2>in India actually fostered my </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial spirit.</v>

312
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can do it a little bit of a little</v>

313
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 2>bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

314
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects.</v>

315
00:17:57.391 --> 00:18:02.391
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely selection at play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that across every culture</v>

316
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals are born Tabula Rasa,</v>

317
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.283
<v Speaker 2>some cultures are much more conducive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the entrepreneurial spirit bloom </v>

318
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 2>and as a result you see people go so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much farther.</v>

319
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 2>But there are other cultures and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures stifle it.</v>

320
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.533
<v Speaker 2>But as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we all have the same proclivity </v>

321
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.233
<v Speaker 2>to be the persons that we can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that I always </v>

322
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:28.734
<v Speaker 2>credited in my education in India is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on thinking and critical thinking </v>

323
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.870
<v Speaker 2>and intellectual ism.</v>

324
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.140
<v Speaker 2>So the concept of a nerd growing up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me was unheard off because the,</v>

325
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.453
<v Speaker 2>the coolest kids were also the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>participated in science and elocution </v>

326
00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 2>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

327
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:51.384
<v Speaker 2>I was always at the forefront.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't so much of a sportsperson </v>

328
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.773
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was very much in debates in </v>

329
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:59.190
<v Speaker 2>elocution competitions and science </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitions and so on.</v>

330
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.173
<v Speaker 2>And that was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't considered rural United </v>

331
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

332
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 2>So the concept that there's a node and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>node is socially awkward,</v>

333
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.980
<v Speaker 2>which was unheard of for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you another example.</v>

334
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother was the one that first talked</v>

335
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:15.594
<v Speaker 2>to me about Iran and of course in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>journey that I was telling you about </v>

336
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:19.794
<v Speaker 2>where I had to find my own identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading atlas shrugged was really the </v>

337
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:28.851
<v Speaker 2>pillar of strength and helped me </v>
<v Speaker 2>identify my own sense of life.</v>

338
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.893
<v Speaker 2>But the way I read atlas shrugged you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>find very funny is I'm in colleges in </v>

339
00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:36.744
<v Speaker 2>India.</v>

340
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 2>If you're a guy and you want to impress </v>
<v Speaker 2>a chick,</v>

341
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 2>you carry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my time,</v>

342
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.663
<v Speaker 2>a paperback novel of Atlas shrugged in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your back pocket because that means if </v>

343
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 2>you're intellectually you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

344
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I was also said it was also sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so fascinating to me.</v>

345
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:55.991
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

346
00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:57.090
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also said,</v>

347
00:19:57.091 --> 00:19:58.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're young,</v>

348
00:19:58.051 --> 00:19:58.884
<v Speaker 2>then you believe in these views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you grow up and you grow over </v>

349
00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:02.850
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never grown over it.</v>

350
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that that aspect of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

351
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.143
<v Speaker 2>the ability to think through decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one that I will credit the Indian </v>

352
00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 2>culture and my father for endowing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

353
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you'll be happy to know,</v>

354
00:20:20.111 --> 00:20:22.090
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned to you before that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

355
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.943
<v Speaker 1>I was at the students for liberty </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference and I met several students </v>

356
00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:28.720
<v Speaker 1>from India who were there that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved with Iran,</v>

357
00:20:28.721 --> 00:20:29.554
<v Speaker 1>instituted in that consider themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective isn't all that and it seems </v>

358
00:20:31.661 --> 00:20:34.120
<v Speaker 1>that some of those ideas at least are </v>
<v Speaker 1>thriving there.</v>

359
00:20:34.121 --> 00:20:36.490
<v Speaker 1>So that brings it into the modern day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

360
00:20:36.491 --> 00:20:37.324
<v Speaker 1>So as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really loved your bio and they were a </v>

361
00:20:38.681 --> 00:20:41.800
<v Speaker 1>couple of great quotes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to read one directly to you.</v>

362
00:20:41.801 --> 00:20:46.150
<v Speaker 1>You said my passion is upward mobility </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated across intellectual,</v>

363
00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 1>psychological and economic realms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cared deeply about growth.</v>

364
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.303
<v Speaker 1>Achievement for me is measured not by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the level you have attained as much as </v>

365
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 1>the road you have traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

366
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:57.184
<v Speaker 1>the journey is the destination and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>cared deeply about integrity as in the </v>

367
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 1>whole of a person rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual part.</v>

368
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And I thought there's obviously a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

369
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that this is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're missing these days.</v>

370
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:12.184
<v Speaker 1>We've got people that are just screaming</v>
<v Speaker 1>at each other all the time that </v>

371
00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:19.120
<v Speaker 1>everyone's pretending they're an expert </v>
<v Speaker 1>in everything.</v>

372
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Nobody sort of listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

373
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been traveling with Jordan Peterson</v>

374
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:24.574
<v Speaker 1>allowed who's talking so much about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is such simple stuff in a </v>

375
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 1>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he's quite brilliant at it.</v>

376
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:32.620
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and being a full person.</v>

377
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.000
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that that was really what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were getting to.</v>

378
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

379
00:21:36.811 --> 00:21:38.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the question?</v>

380
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

381
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I guess I sort of know why you came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe this,</v>

382
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.560
<v Speaker 1>but we seem to have a real lack of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to be a full integral part</v>

383
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.663
<v Speaker 2>these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in part it really relates to </v>

384
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.500
<v Speaker 2>this entrepreneurial mindset and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth mindset.</v>

385
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.860
<v Speaker 2>And for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

386
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:04.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a perspective that is in some sense,</v>

387
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 2>selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me explain by what I mean by that.</v>

388
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 2>And I mean selfish in a very positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>way here.</v>

389
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am right now in endowed professor.</v>

390
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll just give you an example of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

391
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:22.260
<v Speaker 2>and I get to mentor a lot of young minds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many of them come to my office,</v>

392
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:25.950
<v Speaker 2>particularly Phd Students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

393
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.890
<v Speaker 2>with this mindset of I know so much it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is true,</v>

394
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.783
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think about the interaction between </v>

395
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.890
<v Speaker 2>a student and a professor where if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor says,</v>

396
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:39.813
<v Speaker 2>I know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're my student and you're going to </v>

397
00:22:41.441 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 2>learn from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a one way street.</v>

398
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.180
<v Speaker 2>It's the student benefiting from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor with that mindset.</v>

399
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 2>But how has the professor benefiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>from it?</v>

400
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Where is my learning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is my growth?</v>

401
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:55.683
<v Speaker 2>So in this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways that I approach this </v>

402
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:04.171
<v Speaker 2>relationship is I see you have to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>this conversation thinking of each other</v>

403
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 2>as intellectual equals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may know more than you,</v>

404
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.170
<v Speaker 2>but especially in the realm of research </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is creating new knowledge.</v>

405
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.333
<v Speaker 2>I need you to have an questioning mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what happens if you're saying </v>

406
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 2>something that I want to challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and after all in academia,</v>

407
00:23:24.941 --> 00:23:25.774
<v Speaker 2>we are in the marketplace for ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I challenge you and your mind </v>

408
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 2>immediately shuts down because you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

409
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Rajshree said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's the expert professor.</v>

410
00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:38.260
<v Speaker 2>She knows everything and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to challenge me,</v>

411
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 2>then you're not allowing yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn.</v>

412
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 2>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I know that about you,</v>

413
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.943
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shut myself down and I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to send so myself from expressing </v>

414
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:52.160
<v Speaker 2>my ideas because I want your mind to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>open.</v>

415
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 2>So now we both lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bold silenced ourselves.</v>

416
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.840
<v Speaker 2>So this is just one example of where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that this,</v>

417
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.093
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this focus on growth and on learning is </v>

418
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 2>actually very liberating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that sense,</v>

419
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 2>very selfish for me because now like </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them is a two way street.</v>

420
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also learning how do you get</v>

421
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:17.510
<v Speaker 1>over the concept that selfishness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow evil?</v>

422
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 1>That I think a lot of people believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>this inherently.</v>

423
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:20.721
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

424
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they think,</v>

425
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:23.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're evil.</v>

426
00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.323
<v Speaker 2>So this actually relates to one of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point about the lack of integration or </v>

427
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

428
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about either or.</v>

429
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 2>So the common concept of selfishness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>as in,</v>

430
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:39.314
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're only thinking about yourself and </v>

431
00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 2>not thinking about the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

432
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 2>why does it have to be an eternal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why cannot it be a wind when trade,</v>

433
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.400
<v Speaker 2>which is fundamentally recognizing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dignity,</v>

434
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 2>my dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your identity,</v>

435
00:24:55.101 --> 00:24:58.250
<v Speaker 2>my identity and knowledge that should </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

436
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now you and I are talking,</v>

437
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>why are we sitting here and having this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation other than the fact,</v>

438
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:05.640
<v Speaker 2>of course that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

439
00:25:05.641 --> 00:25:06.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

440
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:07.184
<v Speaker 2>we're passionate about these ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we find that our time together is </v>

441
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:12.254
<v Speaker 2>meaningfully well spent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much enjoyment out of this </v>

442
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:16.814
<v Speaker 2>conversation is not at your expense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither is what your gaining outfitted </v>

443
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.290
<v Speaker 2>my expense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

444
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:22.730
<v Speaker 2>we're creating value together.</v>

445
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 1>But you brought it into this room </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that.</v>

446
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:25.893
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right for me at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in a way I'm doing something </v>

447
00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:29.950
<v Speaker 1>selfish in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my show.</v>

448
00:25:29.951 --> 00:25:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing a guest on that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully get people to watch.</v>

449
00:25:34.631 --> 00:25:35.464
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're here because you want your </v>

450
00:25:36.611 --> 00:25:37.444
<v Speaker 1>ideas to spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are watching this </v>

451
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.430
<v Speaker 1>hopefully are getting something out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for themselves.</v>

452
00:25:42.431 --> 00:25:43.264
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what people really need to </v>

453
00:25:43.601 --> 00:25:45.970
<v Speaker 1>understand that that's what's integral </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

454
00:25:45.971 --> 00:25:46.804
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean we're taking from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually means that we're giving to </v>

455
00:25:49.541 --> 00:25:50.640
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and something.</v>

456
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>

457
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.493
<v Speaker 2>this notion that selfishness means this </v>
<v Speaker 2>brute that is just going to ride </v>

458
00:25:58.841 --> 00:25:59.674
<v Speaker 2>roughshod over everybody else's rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and responsibility fundamentally does </v>

459
00:26:04.571 --> 00:26:09.571
<v Speaker 2>not get to this idea that each of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>have our right to live our lives the way</v>

460
00:26:12.131 --> 00:26:16.330
<v Speaker 2>we see best and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the consequences,</v>

461
00:26:16.331 --> 00:26:18.400
<v Speaker 2>good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all our decisions.</v>

462
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.443
<v Speaker 1>How much of this do you think is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>just whether people view humans </v>

463
00:26:22.121 --> 00:26:25.960
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally as good or evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you fundamentally think people are</v>

464
00:26:25.961 --> 00:26:27.760
<v Speaker 1>evil and you say to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be selfish,</v>

465
00:26:27.761 --> 00:26:30.880
<v Speaker 1>well then it is that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run roughshod over everybody and destroy</v>

466
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:31.714
<v Speaker 1>the environment and steal money and kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and all that versus if you </v>

467
00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:35.884
<v Speaker 1>believe people are fundamentally good or</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least neutral than if they do </v>

468
00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:41.200
<v Speaker 1>something for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will potentially be</v>

469
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.280
<v Speaker 2>for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

470
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 2>the only evil is really the use of force</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

471
00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throttle somebody else.</v>

472
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:55.703
<v Speaker 2>You can do what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So long as you're not infringing on </v>

473
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.803
<v Speaker 2>other people's rights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities and their ability to </v>

474
00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:04.884
<v Speaker 2>live their life the way they do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>indeed in a civil society that is the </v>

475
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:09.534
<v Speaker 2>fundamental respect that we all each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other that I live my life the best way </v>

476
00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:16.074
<v Speaker 2>that I think is done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to impose my views on </v>

477
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may have a conversation with you about</v>

478
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:26.631
<v Speaker 2>my views and you're free to agree or </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with my views and free to agree</v>

479
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:27.834
<v Speaker 2>or to interact or not with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't force my views and my </v>

480
00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:35.370
<v Speaker 2>beliefs on you and neither should you </v>
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

481
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:36.204
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's fundamentally the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation between my father and I </v>

482
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.250
<v Speaker 2>didn't think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

483
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.280
<v Speaker 2>It is that we were both very aligned in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our views 80 percent of the time,</v>

484
00:27:44.281 --> 00:27:45.114
<v Speaker 2>but the 20 percent where he thought that</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a father he had the right to tell me </v>

485
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.183
<v Speaker 2>what I should do as opposed to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitator and guide an advisor to my </v>

486
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:58.320
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the fundamental disconnect.</v>

487
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we spend too much time on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 20 percent or you know,</v>

488
00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:02.804
<v Speaker 1>I think I heard Barry Weiss on real time</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the narcissism of small </v>

489
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:05.864
<v Speaker 1>differences where we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can agree on almost everything </v>

490
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.820
<v Speaker 1>philosophically and then we find </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

491
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:11.773
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that is what we focus on our </v>

492
00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:13.940
<v Speaker 1>level</v>

493
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 2>and it really depends upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that something in a hierarchy of your</v>

494
00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:19.524
<v Speaker 2>values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental issue that you do need to </v>

495
00:28:23.781 --> 00:28:24.614
<v Speaker 2>disagree on or is that something in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of your values and your </v>

496
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.500
<v Speaker 2>beliefs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that is not as critical to the</v>

497
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:38.420
<v Speaker 2>conversation that we're having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I prefer a indeed.</v>

498
00:28:38.421 --> 00:28:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I am a big believer in win-win outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

499
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

500
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.970
<v Speaker 2>my husband is my best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>

501
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.410
<v Speaker 2>The last thing I would want is for him </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say Rajshree,</v>

502
00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not because it gives me any selfish joy,</v>

503
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.920
<v Speaker 2>not because I get any pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take pity on you.</v>

504
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I feel sorry for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why my life's objective is to</v>

505
00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:05.600
<v Speaker 2>take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want a relationship?</v>

506
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I walk out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>

507
00:29:07.881 --> 00:29:12.881
<v Speaker 2>if I am not giving you personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction and joy in being with me,</v>

508
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.300
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not your best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like your mind,</v>

509
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:18.643
<v Speaker 2>then this relationship is not a win win </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to be either an object </v>

510
00:29:22.671 --> 00:29:23.504
<v Speaker 2>of charity or a or pity or A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to feel like you're </v>

511
00:29:28.971 --> 00:29:29.804
<v Speaker 2>obligated,</v>

512
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.063
<v Speaker 1>so I want to backup to say you said a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few minutes ago about the way that you </v>

513
00:29:33.531 --> 00:29:38.531
<v Speaker 1>teach and that exchange between </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor and student where it's sort of</v>

514
00:29:39.141 --> 00:29:41.030
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to look at each other as </v>
<v Speaker 1>equals.</v>

515
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I might learn something from them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they might learn something from me.</v>

516
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.160
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two parts of that.</v>

517
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.113
<v Speaker 1>First all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often do you find that you actually </v>

518
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:47.944
<v Speaker 1>learned something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

519
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.780
<v Speaker 2>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed.</v>

520
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Maryland honored me with a</v>

521
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:58.831
<v Speaker 2>distinguished scholar teacher award and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my first slides was about exactly</v>

522
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:00.694
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The debt that I owe to my advisor who </v>

523
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 2>incidentally gave me away when Robin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got married.</v>

524
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I remember my father wasn't talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

525
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:09.993
<v Speaker 2>My advisor was my second father and so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned a lot from him and I have </v>

526
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 2>benefited from that learning off a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentor advisor relationship,</v>

527
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.893
<v Speaker 2>but I have benefited equally from paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>it forward so every one of my phd </v>

528
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:25.324
<v Speaker 2>students I can pinpoint to you exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what ideas they helped me learn which </v>

529
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:33.334
<v Speaker 2>empirical context and innovative </v>
<v Speaker 2>industries I went into along with them </v>

530
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.303
<v Speaker 2>and how my own scholarship has </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally benefited and even change </v>

531
00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:47.410
<v Speaker 2>trajectories because of my phd students.</v>

532
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.343
<v Speaker 1>So the second part of that then would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that is a real rarity on </v>

533
00:30:51.621 --> 00:30:52.454
<v Speaker 1>college campuses these days that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors are willing to learn from </v>

534
00:30:55.251 --> 00:30:58.670
<v Speaker 1>students because when I go to colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm doing all the time now,</v>

535
00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.773
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I hear most is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>students are actually afraid to </v>

536
00:31:02.721 --> 00:31:03.554
<v Speaker 1>challenge their professors because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's going to hurt their grades </v>

537
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.120
<v Speaker 1>and that generally just generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

538
00:31:08.121 --> 00:31:12.350
<v Speaker 1>this seems to come from more leftist </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors that if you challenge them on</v>

539
00:31:12.351 --> 00:31:13.184
<v Speaker 1>intersectionality or or any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people actually think their grades </v>

540
00:31:17.211 --> 00:31:20.120
<v Speaker 1>will suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's</v>

541
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.030
<v Speaker 2>a broad problem in academia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

542
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

543
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

544
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.910
<v Speaker 2>there is this part of me in my soul that</v>
<v Speaker 2>says that just cannot be true.</v>

545
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Please let this not be true because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental identity,</v>

546
00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:42.881
<v Speaker 2>often academic should be one which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused on learning and focused on ideas</v>

547
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:48.730
<v Speaker 2>and indeed I would say that one requires</v>
<v Speaker 2>a confidence and a self esteem and to be</v>

548
00:31:50.421 --> 00:31:51.254
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with being challenged and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>often I do have several colleagues that </v>

549
00:31:56.751 --> 00:31:57.584
<v Speaker 2>I worry about in as much as they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make good advisors and part of the </v>

550
00:32:01.971 --> 00:32:02.804
<v Speaker 2>reason they don't make good advisors is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not because they are not experts in </v>

551
00:32:06.201 --> 00:32:07.034
<v Speaker 2>their sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but precisely because they cannot stand </v>

552
00:32:11.541 --> 00:32:15.200
<v Speaker 2>being challenged by their students and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

553
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.980
<v Speaker 2>that's a lose lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only are you stymieing the students'</v>

554
00:32:18.981 --> 00:32:21.260
<v Speaker 2>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you signing your own growth.</v>

555
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear people talking about </v>

556
00:32:23.701 --> 00:32:24.534
<v Speaker 1>the free speech issues on college </v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses and at the conference that we </v>

557
00:32:27.571 --> 00:32:28.404
<v Speaker 1>were at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were literally hundreds of </v>

558
00:32:29.431 --> 00:32:32.490
<v Speaker 1>professors there to talk about how do we</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend free speech.</v>

559
00:32:32.491 --> 00:32:33.324
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole purpose of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you sense that something has shifted </v>

560
00:32:36.991 --> 00:32:38.880
<v Speaker 1>in the last couple of years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it seem worse?</v>

561
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I give you my own personal story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About three years,</v>

562
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.433
<v Speaker 2>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up writing an op Ed in the </v>

563
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Washington Post on confessions of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>silenced professor.</v>

564
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Now you've heard me these last 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes.</v>

565
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Anyone that knows me says Rajshree you </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence.</v>

566
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Give me a break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easily silenced.</v>

567
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.963
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And indeed part of the team off that </v>

568
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 2>ipad was a very important self </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization that I had.</v>

569
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:17.870
<v Speaker 2>And that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was now starting to think,</v>

570
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.303
<v Speaker 2>do I really want to take this on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a colleague of mine who we </v>

571
00:33:25.431 --> 00:33:26.264
<v Speaker 2>were just having a conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that had happened at a </v>

572
00:33:28.401 --> 00:33:29.910
<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

573
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 2>and she said to me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

574
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.253
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I weigh in on this or should I </v>

575
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:38.810
<v Speaker 2>just let it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the point is not what the issue was.</v>

576
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.270
<v Speaker 2>The point is that I even asked that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

577
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 2>which is what this colleague said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>

578
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:44.624
<v Speaker 2>Rajshree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did you become so afraid of </v>

579
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:48.140
<v Speaker 2>speaking your mind?</v>

580
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 2>And that really hit me in my gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

581
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did I start thinking if I do this,</v>

582
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:01.370
<v Speaker 2>what's going to be the fallout within </v>
<v Speaker 2>the academic circles?</v>

583
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:02.503
<v Speaker 2>Should I repress myself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when I realized that the </v>

584
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:07.850
<v Speaker 2>spiral of silence where we ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

585
00:34:07.851 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can talk about censorship.</v>

586
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I actually think at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maryland,</v>

587
00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I am in a great university president on </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

588
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.520
<v Speaker 2>We have a investment and a dedication to</v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

589
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.903
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thinking about the academia as a </v>

590
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:27.270
<v Speaker 2>marketplace for ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So great to hear it.</v>

591
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

592
00:34:29.321 --> 00:34:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I came here,</v>

593
00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I had a phenomenal conversation with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

594
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.193
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regarding an event where we're worried </v>

595
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:36.524
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not there is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be some backlash because of some of the </v>

596
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:40.820
<v Speaker 2>people I've been bringing in in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

597
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.530
<v Speaker 2>But for us it's very important to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that reasoned and respectful discourse.</v>

598
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.150
<v Speaker 2>But for me it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

599
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:51.140
<v Speaker 2>people from the outside can tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want.</v>

600
00:34:51.141 --> 00:34:56.141
<v Speaker 2>But when you start to silence yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you silence your mind.</v>

601
00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 2>That's when you don't let your </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovative creativity.</v>

602
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 2>What is freedom of speech about it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not in the freedom to agree.</v>

603
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.360
<v Speaker 2>It's the freedom to disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doing so in a manner,</v>

604
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back to this use of force,</v>

605
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say what I want.</v>

606
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

607
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in college campuses these days,</v>

608
00:35:17.661 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that they say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

609
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:21.800
<v Speaker 2>words can hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

610
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I was in a convent and the teachers used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

611
00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 2>sticks and stones can break my bones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but words don't hurt me.</v>

612
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>

613
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:35.651
<v Speaker 2>words do have power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not denying that for sure.</v>

614
00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Several of the things that father said </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me psychologically will very wounding</v>

615
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:41.094
<v Speaker 2>and I had to work through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not denying the fact that words </v>

616
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 2>in the psychological and intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>ram are very powerful,</v>

617
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.253
<v Speaker 2>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fundamental difference between </v>

618
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:52.644
<v Speaker 2>words and coercion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As in now I am forcing you to think </v>

619
00:35:57.241 --> 00:35:58.074
<v Speaker 2>otherwise because words are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally our minds thinking and </v>

620
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 2>then communicating with each other.</v>

621
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.290
<v Speaker 1>We've had a long sort of slippery road </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this,</v>

622
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:08.124
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where people are starting to think that </v>

623
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:09.804
<v Speaker 1>words mean action or that you have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of right to not be offended or a </v>

624
00:36:13.291 --> 00:36:15.760
<v Speaker 1>right to comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just simply don't have.</v>

625
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I think actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

626
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.003
<v Speaker 2>it's the converse is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to be courageous to look at </v>

627
00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:30.000
<v Speaker 2>something and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't accord with my beliefs,</v>

628
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.193
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

629
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.183
<v Speaker 2>Let me use a different analogy out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People often talk about open versus </v>

630
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:36.624
<v Speaker 2>closed mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think neither of those </v>

631
00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:39.534
<v Speaker 2>concepts make sense because what is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>closed mine that is the professor that </v>

632
00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:45.030
<v Speaker 2>you and I were just talking about who </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

633
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you challenge me?</v>

634
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 2>I've made up my decision already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

635
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 2>But an open mind is someone that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the fence,</v>

636
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:56.640
<v Speaker 2>not willing to take any kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed stand.</v>

637
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.743
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would prefer a close mind to an open </v>

638
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:00.780
<v Speaker 2>mind in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

639
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:05.990
<v Speaker 2>But what I really care about is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>active mine that I have some opinions,</v>

640
00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:06.924
<v Speaker 2>some beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're based on the prior thinking </v>

641
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:12.840
<v Speaker 2>that I have done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not omniscient.</v>

642
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.913
<v Speaker 2>I'm not infallible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have made mistakes in my </v>

643
00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:21.600
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so having an active mind allows me,</v>

644
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives me the permission to say I do have</v>

645
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:26.634
<v Speaker 2>these thoughts and beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if someone provides me with </v>

646
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:35.661
<v Speaker 2>compelling evidence and compelling logic</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would make me change my thinking,</v>

647
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 2>then it isn't my best interests to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

648
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:41.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

649
00:37:41.821 --> 00:37:42.654
<v Speaker 1>I find I often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit across brilliant people all the </v>

650
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 1>time and every now and again someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped something that I think,</v>

651
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.264
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've been trying to get to </v>

652
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.453
<v Speaker 1>active mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm going to start using that </v>

653
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:54.230
<v Speaker 1>phrase because that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just want an open mind of,</v>

654
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.433
<v Speaker 1>of endless nothing actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to close my but an </v>

655
00:37:58.051 --> 00:37:59.040
<v Speaker 1>active mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep.</v>

656
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Keep working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.640
<v Speaker 1>So I want to ask you one other thing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

658
00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.493
<v Speaker 1>So then I really want to focus on all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff that you're teaching for the </v>

659
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 1>whole second half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the actual solution is</v>

660
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:10.380
<v Speaker 1>related to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if a,</v>

661
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.243
<v Speaker 1>if a professor like you has this sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>need or fear of self censoring and I </v>

662
00:38:18.701 --> 00:38:19.534
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty obvious to me how open and </v>

663
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.750
<v Speaker 1>courageous you are inherently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

664
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the solution is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we were at this conference,</v>

665
00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:27.744
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the professors were saying this</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to come from the donors because the </v>

666
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:31.884
<v Speaker 1>administrators at the schools cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 1>brave enough if they think that their </v>

667
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 1>jobs are on the line all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that the one way to do it is that if</v>

668
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:39.934
<v Speaker 1>the donors are slowly turning off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to professors that won't defend </v>

669
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:47.380
<v Speaker 1>free speech or administrators who won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>back the professors who do that.</v>

670
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 1>That might be though</v>

671
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.710
<v Speaker 2>the chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense to you?</v>

672
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I disagree with it,</v>

673
00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Speaker 2>but let me explain to you why I disagree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

674
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.243
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

675
00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.510
<v Speaker 2>you cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this comes back to the first question</v>

676
00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:07.410
<v Speaker 2>you asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do I focus on integrity and why do I</v>

677
00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:08.244
<v Speaker 2>think about economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is money and donors along with </v>

678
00:39:11.701 --> 00:39:15.270
<v Speaker 2>psychological and intellectual growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

679
00:39:15.271 --> 00:39:19.160
<v Speaker 2>you cannot have one without the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are pieces of an entire,</v>

680
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

681
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 2>that fit together to make an integrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole within academia.</v>

682
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:30.590
<v Speaker 2>One always has to worry about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've got all of these pressures,</v>

683
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.710
<v Speaker 2>pressures for conformity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressures for funding and resources that</v>

684
00:39:34.711 --> 00:39:35.544
<v Speaker 2>are coming in there would you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>care about and which you cannot renege </v>

685
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:45.170
<v Speaker 2>if you are an intellectual entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is truly what being in academia is</v>

686
00:39:45.331 --> 00:39:46.164
<v Speaker 2>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being an intellectual entrepreneur is </v>

687
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:53.630
<v Speaker 2>your unwavering focus on knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating knowledge,</v>

688
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.910
<v Speaker 2>and if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I may say so,</v>

689
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.763
<v Speaker 2>untruth</v>

690
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.430
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like any venture capitalist,</v>

691
00:40:02.431 --> 00:40:05.670
<v Speaker 2>so this intellectual entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a good analogy,</v>

692
00:40:05.671 --> 00:40:10.020
<v Speaker 2>actually venture capitalists provide you</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the financial resources,</v>

693
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:13.710
<v Speaker 2>but they are complimentary resource </v>
<v Speaker 2>providers.</v>

694
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.000
<v Speaker 2>They cannot tell you which direction </v>
<v Speaker 2>should you go,</v>

695
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:23.150
<v Speaker 2>nor should they right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have that creative mindset,</v>

696
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.593
<v Speaker 2>that intellectual horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not courageous enough to go </v>

697
00:40:27.661 --> 00:40:28.494
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then any kind of pressure from the </v>

698
00:40:30.691 --> 00:40:31.524
<v Speaker 2>venture capitalists is not going to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor are any kind of pivots and </v>

699
00:40:35.221 --> 00:40:36.054
<v Speaker 2>directions and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way I look at it is I do not and </v>

700
00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:45.471
<v Speaker 2>will not ever change my research based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on what donors may or may not give.</v>

701
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:47.483
<v Speaker 2>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will look for aligned to donors </v>

702
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.850
<v Speaker 2>because you cannot put the cart before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the horse.</v>

703
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:54.923
<v Speaker 2>You cannot put your purpose behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money or the success metrics of your </v>

704
00:41:01.591 --> 00:41:02.424
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your purpose has to drive all of the </v>

705
00:41:05.281 --> 00:41:10.200
<v Speaker 2>other resources that you garner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if an administrator lacks courage,</v>

706
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.300
<v Speaker 2>that's on the administrator first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>foremost.</v>

707
00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.420
<v Speaker 2>If an academic lacks courage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conviction,</v>

708
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.433
<v Speaker 2>that's on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have complimentary people </v>

709
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.550
<v Speaker 2>aligned with you kind of helping you </v>
<v Speaker 2>along the way,</v>

710
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.230
<v Speaker 2>but they cannot substitute for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental drive that you need to have.</v>

711
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything that we spent the first 30</v>

712
00:41:31.001 --> 00:41:35.450
<v Speaker 1>some odd minutes talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of leads to academic integrity.</v>

713
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.613
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like to me that these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need not only the students to </v>

714
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 1>have some integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the administrators,</v>

715
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:44.660
<v Speaker 1>that professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>

716
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 1>everyone at the university altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's a fair?</v>

717
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.820
<v Speaker 2>That's what I expect you to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

718
00:41:49.821 --> 00:41:50.780
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

719
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that we often confuse the terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic freedom and academic integrity.</v>

720
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Would we really care about is academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity first and foremost,</v>

721
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.233
<v Speaker 2>and academic integrity really means that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to sell my soul or my </v>

722
00:42:06.471 --> 00:42:10.970
<v Speaker 2>ideas based on the highest bidder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that,</v>

723
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:11.804
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is again the search for truth </v>

724
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:17.860
<v Speaker 2>that requires integrity and then of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course I have the freedom to collaborate</v>

725
00:42:18.561 --> 00:42:19.394
<v Speaker 2>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including donors on areas where we find </v>

726
00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:26.630
<v Speaker 2>mutually beneficial relationships and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

727
00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 2>when trade.</v>

728
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you talked </v>

729
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:29.924
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I referenced it earlier in one of </v>

730
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 1>these quotes are that you really focused</v>
<v Speaker 1>on is upward mobility.</v>

731
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:34.424
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

732
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.293
<v Speaker 1>I think it's particularly interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now because if you listen to some </v>

733
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:38.744
<v Speaker 1>of our political leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like we've sort of completely </v>

734
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:44.030
<v Speaker 1>lost the ability that we were separated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by class and all that.</v>

735
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 1>You come from a place where upward </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobility was very hard.</v>

736
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:48.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotten less hard as they've </v>

737
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:53.210
<v Speaker 1>embraced as India's embrace capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

738
00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I guess in the most broad sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me why you think upward mobility is</v>

739
00:42:55.881 --> 00:42:57.650
<v Speaker 1>so important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

740
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.080
<v Speaker 1>what's the state of it in America right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

741
00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:05.950
<v Speaker 2>So I actually think that we in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>

742
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:11.850
<v Speaker 2>focus on upward mobility as if this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a major problem in the US.</v>

743
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Other countries are becoming more market</v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented than the United States.</v>

744
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:24.870
<v Speaker 2>The United States still stands as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one place where you really,</v>

745
00:43:25.931 --> 00:43:26.764
<v Speaker 2>really have the ability to be upwardly </v>
<v Speaker 2>mobile and I think that is the greatest </v>

746
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:32.583
<v Speaker 2>asset that the United States still have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm very proud to call this country </v>

747
00:43:36.821 --> 00:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>my country of choice.</v>

748
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:39.383
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's sit in that idea for a second </v>

749
00:43:40.561 --> 00:43:41.394
<v Speaker 1>because I totally agree with it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that all of the people who </v>

750
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.283
<v Speaker 1>say that's not true are missing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are laws here allow you to do </v>

751
00:43:51.991 --> 00:43:55.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that you are going to do</v>

752
00:43:55.261 --> 00:43:56.094
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that it's going to be </v>

753
00:43:56.461 --> 00:43:58.830
<v Speaker 1>handed to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you just said,</v>

754
00:43:58.831 --> 00:44:02.430
<v Speaker 1>as an immigrant that came here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is become tremendously successful.</v>

755
00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.680
<v Speaker 1>You're living proof that you can do it.</v>

756
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that still holds.</v>

757
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.233
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways I think we so take these </v>

758
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:16.001
<v Speaker 2>laws for granted that we don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the world is out there,</v>

759
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.560
<v Speaker 2>so my daughters have grown up and been </v>
<v Speaker 2>born in the United States,</v>

760
00:44:21.561 --> 00:44:26.510
<v Speaker 2>but I think that their biggest learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments come when they leave the country</v>

761
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:31.710
<v Speaker 2>and see things even in India today as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they as it exists,</v>

762
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.933
<v Speaker 2>these see the disparities of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can take for granted were </v>

763
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:37.044
<v Speaker 2>Susan India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still have to fight with the </v>

764
00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:40.344
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still have to fight with these </v>

765
00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:43.734
<v Speaker 2>status aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States is very status free </v>

766
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 2>relative to most other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including India and there's a dignity to</v>

767
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:56.130
<v Speaker 2>human labor here that is often missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in many other cultures.</v>

768
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.593
<v Speaker 2>That is the aspect that I care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I care about upward mobility and </v>

769
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>

770
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Out here I did not have the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>privileges that my daughters too.</v>

771
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I could've been more on the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

772
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.753
<v Speaker 2>I came from a country or from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional family values that I had to </v>

773
00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:20.413
<v Speaker 2>have the family tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was such that I had to have this </v>

774
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:27.570
<v Speaker 2>fight that for sure defined me </v>
<v Speaker 2>positively,</v>

775
00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:28.404
<v Speaker 2>but also class some psychological scars </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course my hope is that my </v>

776
00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 2>daughters don't go through that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could go there and say,</v>

777
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:34.584
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the level at which they're starting </v>

778
00:45:35.761 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 2>off is so much higher than the level I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting off and are they privileged and</v>

779
00:45:40.381 --> 00:45:41.214
<v Speaker 2>look at all that I didn't have or I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus their minds and their ideas and </v>

780
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may start here,</v>

781
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.660
<v Speaker 2>but the definition of your achievement </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not your level,</v>

782
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.853
<v Speaker 2>but where you end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find it fascinating that people are </v>

783
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:57.390
<v Speaker 2>constantly attacking that they are.</v>

784
00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.510
<v Speaker 2>They attack people that have a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more to start with,</v>

785
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Speaker 2>which is the whole point of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want your children to have more.</v>

786
00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:06.483
<v Speaker 2>The only way that it would be fair it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because I can be raised to their </v>

787
00:46:12.721 --> 00:46:13.554
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way to do it is to bring them </v>

788
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 2>down to the level that I started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that fair?</v>

789
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>

790
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:24.860
<v Speaker 2>by focusing on the level that one starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>with as a measure,</v>

791
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.733
<v Speaker 2>often individually achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is not necessarily focusing on </v>

792
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:35.340
<v Speaker 2>their individual effort and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

793
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in India,</v>

794
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

795
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.443
<v Speaker 2>as I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father went from rags to riches and </v>

796
00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:45.150
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were my friends.</v>

797
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Then we're quite rich and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very entitlement mentality.</v>

798
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that they're any happier </v>
<v Speaker 2>than I was even when I was poorer.</v>

799
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.330
<v Speaker 2>So this comes back to the point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

800
00:46:57.331 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 2>the quote that you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just measure a person's success by</v>

801
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 2>their economic riches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also happiness,</v>

802
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:07.200
<v Speaker 2>which is what I care about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a state of mind.</v>

803
00:47:07.201 --> 00:47:09.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a state of consciousness that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be earned.</v>

804
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:10.883
<v Speaker 2>Self esteem then combined with the sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of I'm a materially at a place that I'm </v>

805
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:20.520
<v Speaker 2>comfortable or rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more than that,</v>

806
00:47:20.521 --> 00:47:21.354
<v Speaker 2>psychologically and intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've made something of </v>

807
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:24.594
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is something that is so </v>

808
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:27.354
<v Speaker 2>much more inspiring to go after money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Snyder used to say money is the </v>

809
00:47:31.121 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 2>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not The reason,</v>

810
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:34.180
<v Speaker 2>and I completely agree with that.</v>

811
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:35.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting because I've been </v>

812
00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:36.874
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this a lot lately because</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the show is kind of catching </v>

813
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:40.714
<v Speaker 1>fire and I'm doing okay financially and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're building something good and I'm </v>

814
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.073
<v Speaker 1>traveling a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say Nice things to me all the </v>

815
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 1>time and I've been thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people keep saying,</v>

816
00:47:48.101 --> 00:47:48.934
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get some big offer from </v>

817
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:51.920
<v Speaker 1>one of these networks or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

818
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I hope I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love this.</v>

819
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm actually happy now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm doing what I think I'm supposed</v>

820
00:47:58.601 --> 00:48:02.710
<v Speaker 1>to be doing and I don't know where that </v>
<v Speaker 1>road goes,</v>

821
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.850
<v Speaker 1>but looking at everything holistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about money,</v>

822
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:09.910
<v Speaker 1>it's about doing something that gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>you value at all that uh,</v>

823
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.970
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we seem not to focus enough.</v>

824
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.190
<v Speaker 2>But that's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

825
00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I get so much joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

826
00:48:16.081 --> 00:48:17.610
<v Speaker 2>to that quote that you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

827
00:48:17.611 --> 00:48:19.770
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the journey is the destination.</v>

828
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether I would,</v>

829
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I feel younger today than I did when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was 20 years old.</v>

830
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.213
<v Speaker 2>And what's the big difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I have earned the self </v>

831
00:48:29.851 --> 00:48:30.684
<v Speaker 2>esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not recognition outside because people </v>

832
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.463
<v Speaker 2>you know and you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a lot of people and they come </v>

833
00:48:36.811 --> 00:48:37.860
<v Speaker 2>to you and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Dave,</v>

834
00:48:37.861 --> 00:48:41.790
<v Speaker 2>you're so great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who is saying your great makes a big</v>

835
00:48:41.791 --> 00:48:45.750
<v Speaker 2>difference to you hearing whether you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what I mean.</v>

836
00:48:45.751 --> 00:48:46.584
<v Speaker 2>So there has to be a sense of do I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that your saying I'm great for </v>

837
00:48:52.561 --> 00:48:56.730
<v Speaker 2>the reasons that I value and if that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

838
00:48:56.731 --> 00:49:00.540
<v Speaker 2>then I will take external adulation as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

839
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:01.980
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hollow.</v>

840
00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:02.814
<v Speaker 2>It's empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So self esteem is truly what one should </v>

841
00:49:05.881 --> 00:49:06.930
<v Speaker 2>be striving for.</v>

842
00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think at some level capitalism </v>

843
00:49:10.581 --> 00:49:11.414
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the western world in a wider </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense is suffering from success at the </v>

844
00:49:14.871 --> 00:49:19.610
<v Speaker 1>moment that it almost seems like because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been so successful,</v>

845
00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.473
<v Speaker 1>we're now going to that place that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned earlier where we're just </v>

846
00:49:22.311 --> 00:49:25.100
<v Speaker 1>fighting over little differences were </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

847
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:26.083
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you talk about socialism on </v>

848
00:49:28.431 --> 00:49:29.500
<v Speaker 1>college campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

849
00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you'll sell out the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

850
00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:32.990
<v Speaker 1>and if you talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

851
00:49:32.991 --> 00:49:33.824
<v Speaker 1>I find when I go and I mostly talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian or capitalist or whatever </v>

852
00:49:37.101 --> 00:49:38.090
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

853
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.980
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing quite well as well,</v>

854
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:40.993
<v Speaker 1>but that the ideas that are completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary to everything you've just said </v>

855
00:49:44.301 --> 00:49:46.460
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be gaining some momentum,</v>

856
00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.960
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think they're victims of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

857
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:50.123
<v Speaker 2>I think we're victims of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have never really sat down and </v>

858
00:49:54.661 --> 00:49:55.494
<v Speaker 2>thought seriously about the reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 2>our success and by eschewing that </v>

859
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:06.650
<v Speaker 2>intellectual thought and ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>under underpin our success,</v>

860
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.700
<v Speaker 2>we have actually sold our success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

861
00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.550
<v Speaker 1>How should we have done that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean on that?</v>

862
00:50:13.551 --> 00:50:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Our politicians should have talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it more or you mean more in academia?</v>

863
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it starts from k through 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

864
00:50:19.041 --> 00:50:24.041
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have taken this concept,</v>

865
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:26.503
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have short our mind in k through 12 </v>

866
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:30.674
<v Speaker 2>education all the way through college </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this comes back to your example of </v>

867
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:39.700
<v Speaker 2>the faculty advisor that does not want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be challenged by their students.</v>

868
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.210
<v Speaker 2>When you have that mentality as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher,</v>

869
00:50:44.211 --> 00:50:45.044
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in k through 12 or as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor in academia where I know what </v>

870
00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:50.024
<v Speaker 2>is best and I am going to tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is as opposed to facilitate your </v>

871
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:55.304
<v Speaker 2>learning process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are not training our students how to </v>

872
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.193
<v Speaker 2>think anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not giving them the ability to </v>

873
00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:07.340
<v Speaker 2>learn in the manner that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you another example.</v>

874
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Memorization caught off as a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative today,</v>

875
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.180
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

876
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 2>Sir Anthony Leggett who wasn't about </v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

877
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.530
<v Speaker 2>It was a Nobel laureate and a professor </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Illinois,</v>

878
00:51:21.531 --> 00:51:26.300
<v Speaker 2>which is where I was give this inspiring</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech to middle schoolers one day.</v>

879
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:30.110
<v Speaker 2>And the theme of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you know,</v>

880
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:35.350
<v Speaker 2>the more you know what you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowledge is a building on process.</v>

881
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:43.210
<v Speaker 2>You have to learn first to then learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you need to learn again.</v>

882
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.533
<v Speaker 2>And so fostering that spirit in students</v>
<v Speaker 2>will then allow you to go back to first </v>

883
00:51:50.511 --> 00:51:53.300
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not about being an expert on any</v>

884
00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:54.134
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's about any area that you choose </v>

885
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:59.000
<v Speaker 2>to go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't just look at the outcomes.</v>

886
00:51:59.001 --> 00:51:59.834
<v Speaker 2>Don't just get the success factors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then try to emulate the symptoms if you </v>

887
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:06.100
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the the,</v>

888
00:52:06.101 --> 00:52:06.934
<v Speaker 2>the things that accompany success go </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the very fundamental levels of </v>

889
00:52:10.701 --> 00:52:11.534
<v Speaker 2>what are the ideas and what are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first principles that enable success to </v>

890
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:15.810
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>

891
00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:16.643
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because this seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a place where maybe technology has </v>

892
00:52:18.871 --> 00:52:19.704
<v Speaker 1>harmed us because it's like instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a holistic and integral view of </v>

893
00:52:23.761 --> 00:52:25.290
<v Speaker 1>really knowing what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

894
00:52:25.291 --> 00:52:26.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

895
00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:29.460
<v Speaker 1>We Google it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you'll get there,</v>

896
00:52:29.461 --> 00:52:30.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll get there with Google,</v>

897
00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:31.763
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll get just a quick answer </v>

898
00:52:32.731 --> 00:52:34.380
<v Speaker 1>instead of going to the root of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

899
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Where I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

900
00:52:37.171 --> 00:52:38.004
<v Speaker 2>technology is a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not absolve us of our </v>

901
00:52:43.951 --> 00:52:47.910
<v Speaker 2>responsibility on how we use the tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually a huge fan of Google.</v>

902
00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Google scholar has made my life so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>

903
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I remember being a doctoral student and </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to go through Lockwood,</v>

904
00:52:54.061 --> 00:52:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Lockwood Library in six feet of snow in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo.</v>

905
00:52:57.181 --> 00:52:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

906
00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:58.974
<v Speaker 2>If I wanted an answer to a question now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google scholar allows me to do it in </v>

907
00:53:02.401 --> 00:53:03.234
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

908
00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Microfiche is</v>

909
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:08.650
<v Speaker 2>exactly and I had to work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>microfiche to do my data gathering,</v>

910
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.823
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point out here is I can use </v>

911
00:53:11.531 --> 00:53:16.531
<v Speaker 2>google scholar to get just an amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of knowledge at my fingertips.</v>

912
00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.540
<v Speaker 2>How great is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

913
00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I am so thankful to technology to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

914
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.433
<v Speaker 2>but that does not absolve me of the of </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying your is all of the pieces of </v>

915
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:29.220
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

916
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I would say this age of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

917
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:35.003
<v Speaker 2>the need of the mind to have judgment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to discern across all of these </v>

918
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:42.450
<v Speaker 2>pieces of information is at an all time </v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

919
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously you teach and you talk </v>

920
00:53:44.811 --> 00:53:47.750
<v Speaker 1>about entrepreneurial spirit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship.</v>

921
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:49.783
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating related to technology right </v>

922
00:53:52.161 --> 00:53:52.994
<v Speaker 1>now is that Peter Teal is leaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley because he feels that </v>

923
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.120
<v Speaker 1>collectivism leftism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural Marxism,</v>

924
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have some other phrases for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>

925
00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.313
<v Speaker 1>has sort of crushed the ability to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that there isn't the creativity </v>

926
00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:12.140
<v Speaker 1>coming out of silicon valley that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be,</v>

927
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:14.210
<v Speaker 1>which is why we don't have that many new</v>
<v Speaker 1>apps anymore.</v>

928
00:54:14.211 --> 00:54:15.044
<v Speaker 1>We don't have that many new breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies and he is a capitalist and </v>

929
00:54:18.801 --> 00:54:22.340
<v Speaker 1>he's ironically moving to la to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>freer,</v>

930
00:54:22.341 --> 00:54:23.174
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of where people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of us as a capitalist haven here </v>

931
00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:26.624
<v Speaker 1>in California and La specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you find that fascinating that that </v>

932
00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:35.921
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley seems to lean so far left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet it's supposed to be the place of</v>

933
00:54:35.931 --> 00:54:36.764
<v Speaker 1>innovation?</v>

934
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:37.873
<v Speaker 2>Now that you're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just made a connection that I never </v>

935
00:54:39.921 --> 00:54:42.710
<v Speaker 2>thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father represents exactly that.</v>

936
00:54:42.711 --> 00:54:43.760
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

937
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:44.743
<v Speaker 2>He was very free market oriented as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>came to the economic realm and being </v>

938
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.393
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial in terms of creating new</v>
<v Speaker 2>products and services and economic </v>

939
00:54:54.651 --> 00:54:58.040
<v Speaker 2>riches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it came time to thinking he was</v>

940
00:54:58.041 --> 00:55:01.550
<v Speaker 2>very traditionalist and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that bifurcation,</v>

941
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.220
<v Speaker 2>this mindbody dichotomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

942
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:07.460
<v Speaker 2>is what's plaguing a lot of people right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

943
00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.473
<v Speaker 2>So I am not an expert on silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have noticed of course that a lot of </v>

944
00:55:13.731 --> 00:55:15.020
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so facebook,</v>

945
00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw mark Zuckerberg say something</v>

946
00:55:18.621 --> 00:55:22.310
<v Speaker 2>to the effect of you should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic regulation and social media.</v>

947
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:27.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like why you were successful is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you did not have any barriers to</v>

948
00:55:31.371 --> 00:55:36.290
<v Speaker 2>entry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best way to keep them monopoly is to</v>

949
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:38.690
<v Speaker 2>have government regulation because </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

950
00:55:38.691 --> 00:55:40.330
<v Speaker 2>that's the use of force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

951
00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:45.760
<v Speaker 2>If I cannot go into an industry because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is prohibition,</v>

952
00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:50.630
<v Speaker 2>so think about Uber and Uber had to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with in the taxi cab industry.</v>

953
00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:51.643
<v Speaker 2>Think about when airlines was not what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we know it because there were just that </v>

954
00:55:55.191 --> 00:55:56.570
<v Speaker 2>regulated carriers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

955
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:57.703
<v Speaker 2>That's someone that monopoly and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best way for an entrepreneur who has </v>

956
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:05.083
<v Speaker 2>achieved success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now no longer wants to continue to </v>

957
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.313
<v Speaker 2>own their success is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me create barriers to entry through </v>

958
00:56:14.331 --> 00:56:15.164
<v Speaker 2>government regulation so I can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected by any entrepreneur such as </v>

959
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.090
<v Speaker 2>those days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

960
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:26.020
<v Speaker 2>To then come and infringe on what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

961
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:28.710
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if he's trying to protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he has.</v>

962
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.260
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny also how these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>change because you know,</v>

964
00:56:34.261 --> 00:56:37.020
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago before uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in New York City,</v>

965
00:56:37.021 --> 00:56:37.854
<v Speaker 1>basically my whole adult life and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would complain relentlessly about the </v>

966
00:56:40.051 --> 00:56:40.884
<v Speaker 1>cabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all broken down and the drivers </v>

967
00:56:42.301 --> 00:56:43.134
<v Speaker 1>are in friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't pick you up if you're a </v>

968
00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:45.900
<v Speaker 1>certain color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

969
00:56:45.901 --> 00:56:48.090
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Uber comes around,</v>

970
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.660
<v Speaker 1>fixes a lot of these problems by </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity and now people are saying,</v>

971
00:56:51.661 --> 00:56:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you see what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put the cabs out of business.</v>

972
00:56:54.061 --> 00:56:55.560
<v Speaker 1>The same people who were upset</v>

973
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:58.830
<v Speaker 2>first in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's even worse in Boston,</v>

974
00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:04.190
<v Speaker 2>every uber or lyft ride has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to pay five cents of a surcharge and</v>

975
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:07.990
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

976
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:09.373
<v Speaker 2>a fraction of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember whether it's two cents </v>

977
00:57:11.341 --> 00:57:12.290
<v Speaker 2>or three cents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

978
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.870
<v Speaker 2>it adds up and millions of right goals </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the taxi cab industry.</v>

979
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:17.583
<v Speaker 1>That's the industry that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>being replaced by doing a much better </v>

980
00:57:20.301 --> 00:57:21.230
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

981
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:22.160
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

982
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:23.203
<v Speaker 1>So that just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then is there a flaw in capitalism </v>

983
00:57:24.921 --> 00:57:25.754
<v Speaker 1>there somehow because that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably some cronyism that's allowing </v>

984
00:57:29.691 --> 00:57:31.640
<v Speaker 1>the politicians to write these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous</v>

985
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:33.363
<v Speaker 2>is not about markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cronyism is about state isn't cronyism </v>

986
00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.753
<v Speaker 2>is not capitalism at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is government regulation at work and </v>

987
00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:46.020
<v Speaker 2>this comes back to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

988
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're successful.</v>

989
00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.910
<v Speaker 2>I take pride in watching your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody because I enjoy it,</v>

990
00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:59.300
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure is a bit of envy to about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

991
00:57:59.731 --> 00:58:04.731
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could be as eloquent as David </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as the 500,000</v>

992
00:58:07.531 --> 00:58:10.060
<v Speaker 2>people that watched the day Reuben show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.033
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't I love to have that kind of an </v>

994
00:58:13.111 --> 00:58:15.870
<v Speaker 2>impact?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's envy on my part.</v>

995
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:21.980
<v Speaker 2>There are two things I could do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can either be a positive driver of my</v>

996
00:58:22.861 --> 00:58:27.060
<v Speaker 2>energies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could say I want what Dave does has,</v>

997
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:30.990
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that can put me on a growth mindset,</v>

998
00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.490
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that I need to do in order to</v>

999
00:58:35.491 --> 00:58:38.370
<v Speaker 2>achieve those success factors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going back to those principles,</v>

1000
00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:39.353
<v Speaker 2>what are the reasons behind Dave success</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what can I do to emulate or do </v>

1001
00:58:43.291 --> 00:58:47.070
<v Speaker 2>differently than dave or I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1002
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I want what Dave has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't need to own it.</v>

1003
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:52.103
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me get the government to take </v>

1004
00:58:55.201 --> 00:58:58.500
<v Speaker 2>some of what Dave has some of Dave's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsorship,</v>

1005
00:58:58.501 --> 00:58:59.334
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what income inequality and </v>

1006
00:59:01.321 --> 00:59:02.154
<v Speaker 2>redistribution is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking some of your viewership and </v>

1007
00:59:05.221 --> 00:59:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be forcing those people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>now listen to me.</v>

1008
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:11.820
<v Speaker 2>So that's where we're using government </v>
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

1009
00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:12.683
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's income redistribution or </v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of yardstick of value where </v>

1010
00:59:17.071 --> 00:59:19.620
<v Speaker 2>we're redistributing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're saying we're going to take it from</v>

1011
00:59:19.621 --> 00:59:23.030
<v Speaker 2>you and that actually negates your </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewers rights.</v>

1012
00:59:23.031 --> 00:59:23.864
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because now if I have the government </v>

1013
00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 2>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then some of them would be forced to not</v>

1014
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 2>watch you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but watch me on the other hand,</v>

1015
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:32.960
<v Speaker 2>this jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1016
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:34.760
<v Speaker 2>the difference between envy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>jealousy.</v>

1017
00:59:34.761 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 2>One of my colleagues just told me </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently and we is when I want something</v>

1018
00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:39.494
<v Speaker 2>I don't have jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is when I want to keep something that I </v>

1019
00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:45.320
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm being threatened against,</v>

1020
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:46.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1021
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive or negative.</v>

1022
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 2>If I feel jealousy because I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened about what I'm about to lose,</v>

1023
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I can go ahead and say what is it that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do in order to keep it?</v>

1024
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Or I can create barriers and say you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>have it through the use of force.</v>

1025
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:02.833
<v Speaker 2>The same principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work at cronyism at both sides of the </v>

1026
01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:06.863
<v Speaker 2>yardstick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we talk about relative poverty </v>

1027
01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:11.750
<v Speaker 2>in the United States as an income </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>

1028
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:14.660
<v Speaker 2>by the way coming from India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what true poverty is.</v>

1029
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.793
<v Speaker 2>We in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the minimum level of poverty here is so </v>

1030
01:00:19.611 --> 01:00:22.690
<v Speaker 2>much better than the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we care,</v>

1031
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.530
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about inbeat.</v>

1032
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:28.520
<v Speaker 2>These rich people have what I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I should get them,</v>

1033
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.140
<v Speaker 2>or on the rich end of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this as a welder.</v>

1034
01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:34.383
<v Speaker 2>I'm a person regardless of whether I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>it out of an inheritance or because of </v>

1035
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:41.510
<v Speaker 2>prior entrepreneurial thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's being threatened,</v>

1036
01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.493
<v Speaker 2>but I want to keep it for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best way for me to do that is to </v>

1037
01:00:45.171 --> 01:00:49.220
<v Speaker 2>lobby the government and erect barriers </v>
<v Speaker 2>to entry on both sides.</v>

1038
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.473
<v Speaker 2>The use of governmental regulation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>respond to envy and jealousy is a </v>

1039
01:00:56.421 --> 01:00:57.254
<v Speaker 2>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a positive driver of economic </v>

1040
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:00.614
<v Speaker 2>growth.</v>

1041
01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:01.683
<v Speaker 1>So where do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you draw the line or where is </v>

1042
01:01:03.461 --> 01:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>the starting point then of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>government is supposed to do?</v>

1043
01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:07.853
<v Speaker 2>A government has a legal monopoly on </v>
<v Speaker 2>force as it should because you and I in </v>

1044
01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:14.124
<v Speaker 2>a civil society cannot focus our mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our effort on creating value if we're </v>

1045
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:26.570
<v Speaker 2>always going to worry about somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>looting or taking things away from us.</v>

1046
01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I am not an anarchist.</v>

1047
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I believe in governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the rule of law.</v>

1048
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.113
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are basic functions of the </v>

1049
01:01:37.471 --> 01:01:38.304
<v Speaker 2>government that absolutely are essential</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond that keep the economy away from </v>

1050
01:01:46.171 --> 01:01:47.004
<v Speaker 2>the realm of the government because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government's only ability to do </v>

1051
01:01:50.251 --> 01:01:54.350
<v Speaker 2>something is to say you and your best </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment.</v>

1052
01:01:54.351 --> 01:01:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I think you should go a I am telling you</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to go be,</v>

1053
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.760
<v Speaker 2>you're forcing the mind to not think or </v>
<v Speaker 2>act on their best judgment.</v>

1054
01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting in the,</v>

1055
01:02:07.821 --> 01:02:08.654
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Uber and what you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing in Boston and the penny's </v>

1056
01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:11.903
<v Speaker 1>going back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the cabbies who have nothing to do </v>

1057
01:02:13.471 --> 01:02:14.304
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually is because of regulation </v>

1058
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.573
<v Speaker 1>and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only way to that and let new </v>

1059
01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>businesses thrive is let them thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just let,</v>

1060
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>just let them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them know.</v>

1061
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.611
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1062
01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:27.444
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple more things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do with you and you had a four </v>

1063
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.673
<v Speaker 1>questions about personal leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you ask a lot of your students and </v>

1064
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I thought that these were really great </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it and it really,</v>

1065
01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>this I think sort of puts a nice bow on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that we've talked about here.</v>

1066
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>So the first one is what is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose?</v>

1067
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Kids must be kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Students must be.</v>

1068
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:47.123
<v Speaker 1>They must look at you Kinda Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>curiously when you asked it that one </v>

1069
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>because that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big.</v>

1070
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.593
<v Speaker 2>So that means spend two seconds just </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you about why I came up with </v>

1071
01:02:53.741 --> 01:02:54.580
<v Speaker 2>this framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1072
01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:55.683
<v Speaker 2>I'm a strategy and entrepreneurship </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor and I was asked to teach in a </v>

1073
01:03:00.791 --> 01:03:01.624
<v Speaker 2>program which was largely minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school student based and I was </v>

1074
01:03:06.941 --> 01:03:07.774
<v Speaker 2>asked to give a lecture on strategic </v>
<v Speaker 2>management and strategic management is </v>

1075
01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:11.854
<v Speaker 2>typically the realm of ceos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can highschoolers identify and </v>

1076
01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:22.180
<v Speaker 2>associate with questions that a CEO has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with.</v>

1077
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.073
<v Speaker 2>That was the big challenge that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How am I supposed to talk to them about </v>

1078
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.913
<v Speaker 2>at that time with Steve Jobs is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for apple even though they recognize </v>

1079
01:03:29.771 --> 01:03:34.240
<v Speaker 2>apple and make it real to them and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize I didn't need to do that.</v>

1080
01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:35.853
<v Speaker 2>I could say to them especially because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're at the cusp of identifying who </v>

1081
01:03:40.061 --> 01:03:40.894
<v Speaker 2>they are and creating their identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the CEO of [inaudible] </v>

1082
01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.860
<v Speaker 2>incorporated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you thinking like a ceo?</v>

1083
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 2>What are the four fundamental questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a CEO should ask and are you asking</v>

1084
01:03:54.911 --> 01:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>those questions of yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it begins with the first one is what</v>

1085
01:03:59.021 --> 01:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>is your purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second is,</v>

1086
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:04.660
<v Speaker 2>what does success look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The third is,</v>

1087
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:05.583
<v Speaker 2>what's my value proposition given that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my purpose and that's what </v>

1088
01:04:08.801 --> 01:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>success looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally in this stumps a lot of</v>

1089
01:04:11.921 --> 01:04:12.754
<v Speaker 2>people with whom should I trade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these four questions I think are the </v>

1090
01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.033
<v Speaker 2>essence of any entrepreneurial </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual or any entrepreneurial </v>

1091
01:04:22.481 --> 01:04:23.314
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

1092
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.540
<v Speaker 1>How often when you ask these students </v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions,</v>

1093
01:04:26.541 --> 01:04:28.730
<v Speaker 1>did they have some good answers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh,</v>

1094
01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>these are tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these ones,</v>

1095
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.850
<v Speaker 1>your purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the questions of all time,</v>

1096
01:04:31.851 --> 01:04:32.684
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asking them in the framework of </v>

1097
01:04:33.651 --> 01:04:34.820
<v Speaker 1>business and entrepreneurship.</v>

1098
01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1099
01:04:37.001 --> 01:04:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually agnostic about whether they</v>

1100
01:04:39.851 --> 01:04:40.684
<v Speaker 2>want to define what is your purpose as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it relates to their career or as it </v>

1101
01:04:44.321 --> 01:04:45.154
<v Speaker 2>relates to their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the answers that I provide them in </v>

1102
01:04:48.311 --> 01:04:49.144
<v Speaker 2>the context of thinking and you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be amazed as to how much this resonates </v>

1103
01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:57.850
<v Speaker 2>all the way from beginning high </v>
<v Speaker 2>schoolers,</v>

1104
01:04:57.851 --> 01:05:02.851
<v Speaker 2>including my own daughter who was forced</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take this class with me to executives</v>

1105
01:05:04.421 --> 01:05:05.254
<v Speaker 2>in my executive Mba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is your purpose really requires </v>

1106
01:05:08.681 --> 01:05:13.681
<v Speaker 2>people to think about what problems do I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to solve that are meaningful to me.</v>

1107
01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:16.083
<v Speaker 2>So it again comes to making world a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better place to live by doing something </v>

1108
01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 2>important to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1109
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:22.931
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1110
01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 2>making the world a better place to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>or come on rush,</v>

1111
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:25.630
<v Speaker 2>hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1112
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.250
<v Speaker 2>But what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your world,</v>

1113
01:05:27.251 --> 01:05:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Dave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is my world?</v>

1114
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.793
<v Speaker 2>It's the places you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people you meet and the things that </v>

1115
01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:35.620
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if in doing these three things,</v>

1116
01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:39.370
<v Speaker 2>you have solved the problem and made it </v>
<v Speaker 2>a better place,</v>

1117
01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:43.060
<v Speaker 2>then you've made a world a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've done it by focusing on things</v>

1118
01:05:43.061 --> 01:05:46.600
<v Speaker 2>that are important to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting you're talking about</v>

1119
01:05:46.601 --> 01:05:48.580
<v Speaker 2>all these things through the business </v>
<v Speaker 2>lens,</v>

1120
01:05:48.581 --> 01:05:49.414
<v Speaker 2>but business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about is what you </v>

1121
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.084
<v Speaker 2>said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1122
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.590
<v Speaker 2>which is happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1123
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.540
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

1124
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:57.970
<v Speaker 2>on that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does success look like?</v>

1125
01:05:57.971 --> 01:05:58.804
<v Speaker 2>To me it is the ability to say I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do and I'm good at it because </v>

1126
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:08.170
<v Speaker 2>that's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choose spiral that enables self esteem.</v>

1127
01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:10.960
<v Speaker 2>And when you have self esteem because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good at something,</v>

1128
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:13.630
<v Speaker 2>you want to invest in it to become even </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at it.</v>

1129
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.050
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool waking up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that feeling.</v>

1130
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.540
<v Speaker 2>So that was number two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does success look like?</v>

1131
01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:21.400
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned all of them already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just want to read a little bit.</v>

1132
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.440
<v Speaker 2>So what is your value proposition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So notice that,</v>

1133
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer to the question,</v>

1134
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:31.330
<v Speaker 2>what does success look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Takes an inward perspective,</v>

1135
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:35.950
<v Speaker 2>what do I love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what are my abilities that will</v>

1136
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:40.390
<v Speaker 2>help get me to where I love and what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at?</v>

1137
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:44.740
<v Speaker 2>What is my value proposition is still </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at your abilities,</v>

1138
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:48.820
<v Speaker 2>but now the yard stick is how is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating value to you?</v>

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.640
<v Speaker 2>So can you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love enterprise and innovation,</v>

1140

<v Speaker 2>I love what I do.</v>

1141
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at it.</v>

1142
01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.940

<v Speaker 2>my step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why would that cause you to want to </v>

<v Speaker 2>What benefit do I offer you?</v>

<v Speaker 2>is the focus on value proposition and </v>

1149
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.443
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious because we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence right here because of all the </v>

1150

<v Speaker 2>who should I train?</v>

1156
01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:41.740
<v Speaker 2>That is the one thing that stumps a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people and uh,</v>
