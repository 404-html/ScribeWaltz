1
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.503
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons I like doing long </v>
<v Speaker 1>form interviews is that I can really </v>

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>focus in on important issues with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>guests.</v>

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>In many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issues are inextricably connected,</v>

4
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>making it easy to go from topic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic.</v>

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>If we're talking about political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness,</v>

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty easy jump to free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

7
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>which is then another easy jump to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressive left.</v>

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes these jumps just appear when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking for them,</v>

9
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:26.004
<v Speaker 1>and that's usually when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations get really good is the </v>

10
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>spaces where you have to think that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the breeding ground to spark new ideas.</v>

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.183
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>attorney and legal expert or Reba </v>

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.233
<v Speaker 1>Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done the Dr drew show on Hln </v>

13
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>several times with Reba and always find </v>
<v Speaker 1>her to be incisive,</v>

14
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>thought provoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and passionate.</v>

15
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>While we've appeared together several </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

16
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:48.264
<v Speaker 1>This will be the first time we really </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to flesh out some ideas in a long </v>

17
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>form way without worrying about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial break.</v>

18
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>A rib and I are going to dive into a ton</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hot topics and big ideas.</v>

19
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.434
<v Speaker 1>This week we're going to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything from the black lives matter </v>

20
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>movement to the war on drugs to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oscars,</v>

21
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:03.864
<v Speaker 1>so white controversy as a Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated black woman who founded and </v>

22
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>manages her own very successful law </v>
<v Speaker 1>firm.</v>

23
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.613
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could find a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to tackle so many important </v>

24
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>issues with and arriva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see what just happened there?</v>

25
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I just played some identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't I?</v>

26
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Arriva happens to be black and happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a woman,</v>

27
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.763
<v Speaker 1>but in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that important to our </v>

28
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

29
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:26.604
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume some of her views are based on </v>

30
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>her own personal experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I care about are her ideas,</v>

31
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 1>not the color of her skin or her gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really have to get over the idea that</v>

32
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.224
<v Speaker 1>by looking at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can figure out what they're all </v>

33
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

34
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.643
<v Speaker 1>I literally could not care less about </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's skin color or their religion </v>

35
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>or their sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I care about is their ideas.</v>

36
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>What do they believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they believe it?</v>

37
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Are they right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they wrong?</v>

38
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>What kind of world are they trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create?</v>

39
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>That is simply all that matters to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are black conservatives out there,</v>

40
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.683
<v Speaker 1>there are Mexican Libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are Lesbian Christians and there </v>

41
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:07.364
<v Speaker 1>are cis gendered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue haired video game playing bisexual </v>

42
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:10.644
<v Speaker 1>quakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you care about all those labels </v>

43
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>more than the ideas that the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves believe in,</v>

44
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>then you are actually part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

45
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.703
<v Speaker 1>If you truly care about minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to care about minorities </v>

46
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>within those minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you truly care about diversity,</v>

47
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>then you have to acknowledge diversity </v>
<v Speaker 1>within diversity itself.</v>

48
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.320
<v Speaker 1>We should be defined by what we believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not prejudged by people's assumptions as</v>

49
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>a wise man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once said,</v>

50
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>when you assume you make an ass out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and me,</v>

51
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>my guest this week is a civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>attorney,</v>

52
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.374
<v Speaker 1>legal expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you may have seen us on Dr drew's </v>

53
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>couch together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Eva Martin.</v>

54
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:51.084
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the show.</v>

55
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Good to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

56
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.710
<v Speaker 2>from sitting next to each other to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting across from each other.</v>

57
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.993
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems that we're going to be </v>

58
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>adversaries because we're</v>

59
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>usually on a couch right next to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

60
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>We get some legs touch.</v>

61
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.793
<v Speaker 2>It helps with some of the crazies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come on that show and really make it </v>

62
00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:10.124
<v Speaker 2>difficult for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like you and I who have really </v>

63
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:14.840
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and smart things to say,</v>

64
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.201
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

65
00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>building each other up just as we start </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

67
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>But that's exactly what I wanted to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you on the show because we've been on Dr</v>

68
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.230
<v Speaker 1>drew a couple of times together and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always find you,</v>

69
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>you're extremely passionate and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>your stuff.</v>

70
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And I find there's so many people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

71
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>especially in Cable News and on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable channels that are just yelling and</v>

72
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>screaming about stuff but aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts.</v>

73
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not to brag about my background,</v>

74
00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:46.220
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think of an expert,</v>

75
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.240
<v Speaker 2>you really want the person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some credentials that really make</v>

76
00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:51.074
<v Speaker 2>them an expert and I can't tell you how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many times on these shows I've sat next </v>

77
00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:55.970
<v Speaker 2>to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a conversation,</v>

78
00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:56.661
<v Speaker 2>I want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

79
00:03:56.661 --> 00:03:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am fifth grade.</v>

80
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.070
<v Speaker 2>It just drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

81
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:01.904
<v Speaker 2>there's been this proliferation of quote</v>
<v Speaker 2>unquote experts because there's so many </v>

82
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:05.954
<v Speaker 2>shows and it seems like if you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to say something so outrageous </v>

83
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.790
<v Speaker 2>and to say it very loudly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get booked on a show.</v>

84
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we see pretty routinely </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a lot of these shows.</v>

85
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is again,</v>

86
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.973
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why I love working with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because not only do you know your </v>

87
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:24.270
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get right to it.</v>

88
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.950
<v Speaker 1>So then I'm sitting next to you and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

89
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:28.620
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I just had that kind of just incisive</v>

90
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.010
<v Speaker 1>way of going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to get into some stuff.</v>

91
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.853
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been working on TV for a while and </v>

92
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:35.434
<v Speaker 2>I've had to perfect the soundbite </v>
<v Speaker 2>because oftentimes you get 30 seconds </v>

93
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 2>and I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start checking the news at five.</v>

94
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.713
<v Speaker 2>I read seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight newspapers throughout the day and </v>

95
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:46.054
<v Speaker 2>I'll get a call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's some complex issues that I've </v>

96
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:49.684
<v Speaker 2>got to go on and talk to millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewers to make them understand </v>

97
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.723
<v Speaker 2>sometimes very technical legal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is what's happening to </v>

98
00:04:57.651 --> 00:04:58.484
<v Speaker 2>the courtroom and a a difficult case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a murder trial doesn't really play well </v>

99
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:05.180
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to reduce it to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>32nd sound bite.</v>

100
00:05:05.181 --> 00:05:06.014
<v Speaker 2>So you got to get kind of skilled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to bring that very complex </v>

101
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 2>information to really digestible </v>
<v Speaker 2>television viewers.</v>

102
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly why I like doing the </v>

103
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:16.864
<v Speaker 1>long form interview because now we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour or maybe a little bit more even </v>

104
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>to really get into some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really exchange some ideas.</v>

105
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:23.570
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

106
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.403
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because some of these topics are so big </v>

107
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.633
<v Speaker 2>theater we spend all day talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you've got to reduce it to a </v>

108
00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:32.900
<v Speaker 2>sound bite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I love long form conversations</v>

109
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in the right spot.</v>

110
00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:35.504
<v Speaker 1>But before we get to the issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a little bit on your </v>

111
00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are.</v>

112
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 1>You're from St Louis originally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:39.630
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

114
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 2>was right next to Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Missouri.</v>

115
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.860
<v Speaker 2>So when we were all eyes on Ferguson </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Mike Brown shooting,</v>

116
00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:47.694
<v Speaker 2>it was really personal for me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>not only did I grow up in that </v>

117
00:05:49.831 --> 00:05:50.664
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew so many of the people that were </v>

118
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:54.660
<v Speaker 2>involved on the front lines doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest.</v>

119
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.673
<v Speaker 2>So when that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that explosion in that community </v>

120
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 2>occurred really personally for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

121
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 2>from St Louis and went to college in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago,</v>

122
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.010
<v Speaker 2>University of Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love Chicago.</v>

123
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Glad I'm not there this weekend though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given the blizzard that's been just,</v>

125
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 2>you move the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved it right.</v>

126
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>It's in the sunshine and then went onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard.</v>

127
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I lived in Cambridge.</v>

128
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.743
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately the patriots aren't going </v>

129
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.890
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

130
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my husband's like</v>

131
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.130
<v Speaker 2>the Patriots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

132
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.811
<v Speaker 2>anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

133
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:33.644
<v Speaker 2>So I went to Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I actually worked in a corporate </v>

134
00:06:35.251 --> 00:06:36.084
<v Speaker 2>law firm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked on Wall Street and I was in </v>

135
00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:39.954
<v Speaker 2>this major corporate law firm </v>
<v Speaker 2>representing big fortune 500 companies </v>

136
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.850
<v Speaker 2>and doing a lot of corporate law and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just got tired.</v>

137
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I just stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

138
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Didn't fit with my background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't fit with you know,</v>

139
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.280
<v Speaker 2>who I had grown up to be and the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had influenced me.</v>

140
00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:58.380
<v Speaker 2>So I left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left is really,</v>

141
00:06:58.381 --> 00:06:59.460
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

142
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:00.061
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

143
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:01.410
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good job.</v>

144
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying the corporate lawyers </v>

145
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>make a lot of money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>

146
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I left a good job with a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of perks</v>

147
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 2>and an office like on the 40th floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

148
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.230
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine me calling St Louis family.</v>

149
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:19.064
<v Speaker 2>That's like just over the moon with </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness that first generation college </v>

150
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 2>graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first generation Harvard lawyer,</v>

151
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.743
<v Speaker 2>big corporate law firm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm leaving to go work with one </v>

152
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 2>other lawyer in this tiny little office </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.</v>

153
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give up this huge salary.</v>

154
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't go over too well.</v>

155
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.113
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

156
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.063
<v Speaker 1>you must have felt incredible pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you had sort of accomplished a </v>

157
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:44.234
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

158
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 1>not that advanced in age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

159
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to step away from it.</v>

160
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that sort of what it's all about </v>
<v Speaker 1>really what life is all about?</v>

161
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:53.810
<v Speaker 1>And I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that</v>

162
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 2>folks who find the most happiness in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their careers is because they've taken a</v>

163
00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 2>risk and they really follow their </v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts.</v>

164
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:00.824
<v Speaker 2>They follow their intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do what's on the kind of the </v>

165
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.783
<v Speaker 2>path that's been laid out for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go to Harvard and you're in </v>

166
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.173
<v Speaker 2>the top of your class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your path is supposed to be either you </v>

167
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:15.911
<v Speaker 2>become a supreme court clerk and you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>on to be a judge or you go and you run a</v>

168
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>corporate law for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start off as an associate,</v>

169
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 2>you become a partner and you make a ton </v>
<v Speaker 2>of money and that's a great life.</v>

170
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 2>And having lots of friends that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying there's anything wrong</v>

171
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:27.194
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

172
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>They have a great lifestyles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just wasn't who I was at my core.</v>

173
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to have more control of who I </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>

174
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.163
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to represent little people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be involved in issues that </v>

175
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:40.514
<v Speaker 2>really mattered to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just wanted something different </v>

176
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 2>for my career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had no husband,</v>

177
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.063
<v Speaker 2>had no mortgage and no kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could walk away from a big job </v>

178
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 2>like that when you don't have all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those responsibilities.</v>

179
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you have a husband.</v>

180
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.003
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a law that you run with your </v>

181
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:56.754
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

182
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.613
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have three kids and all of this </v>

183
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:00.550
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're doing a lot of fun.</v>

184
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.713
<v Speaker 2>But I'm happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And about seven years ago I decided I </v>

185
00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 2>wanted to step away from my courtroom </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

186
00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:07.574
<v Speaker 2>I was a trial lawyer and I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a greater impact and I had this </v>

187
00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:11.534
<v Speaker 2>amazing case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a amazing because I was representing </v>

188
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:15.950
<v Speaker 2>these great families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible thing had happened to them.</v>

189
00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Their kids had been abused of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classroom,</v>

190
00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:24.511
<v Speaker 2>some nonverbal autistic kids abusing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>classroom by this just criminal teacher.</v>

191
00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

192
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.380
<v Speaker 2>and they called me from Las Vegas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked me to come and represent them.</v>

193
00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:33.260
<v Speaker 2>And I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Dr Phil was very interested in their</v>

194
00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:34.094
<v Speaker 2>story and invited my clients and then me</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a result of representing them onto </v>

195
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.490
<v Speaker 2>his show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got there.</v>

196
00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:41.324
<v Speaker 2>I loved having an opportunity to raise </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness about an issue I cared about </v>

197
00:09:45.591 --> 00:09:46.940
<v Speaker 2>and break down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.853
<v Speaker 2>what had happened legally and why this </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher was being prosecuted and that </v>

199
00:09:51.651 --> 00:09:52.484
<v Speaker 2>began my TV career and I've been working</v>
<v Speaker 2>in TV ever since that one appearance on </v>

200
00:09:57.321 --> 00:09:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Dr Phil.</v>

201
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even that,</v>

202
00:09:58.721 --> 00:09:59.860
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get to this a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

203
00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:04.270
<v Speaker 1>but even having a case involving autism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've written a book about autism.</v>

204
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:05.104
<v Speaker 1>Your your son has autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like saying is autistic because </v>

205
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.820
<v Speaker 1>it seems very defining versus has </v>
<v Speaker 1>autism.</v>

206
00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just a piece of who he is a so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>even that right there,</v>

207
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:17.004
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice way to start your adventure </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta because it was something that was </v>

208
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.823
<v Speaker 1>very important to you.</v>

209
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're right.</v>

210
00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I did write a book because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrated.</v>

211
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.643
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like what was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was too hard to figure out how to you </v>

212
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.190
<v Speaker 2>get the best education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you get the best healthcare,</v>

213
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.810
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

214
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Harvard trained lawyer and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>having such a difficult time.</v>

215
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.030
<v Speaker 2>What about the mom who has four or five </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids at home,</v>

216
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:41.864
<v Speaker 2>maybe working two jobs and doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time to sit on the Internet all day </v>

217
00:10:44.781 --> 00:10:47.120
<v Speaker 2>like I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and search for this information.</v>

218
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:50.450
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote a book called the everyday </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocate standing up for your child with</v>

219
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:51.284
<v Speaker 2>autism and other special needs to really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring a lot of the information that I </v>

220
00:10:55.101 --> 00:10:55.934
<v Speaker 2>had learned as a parent and as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocate and as a lawyer into one place </v>

221
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.363
<v Speaker 2>that apparent a professional could go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get the help that they need for </v>

222
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:04.844
<v Speaker 2>their child or grandchild or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really just tried to make that </v>

223
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:09.890
<v Speaker 2>journey a little easier for parents.</v>

224
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.651
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

225
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to dive a little deeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that in a bit,</v>

226
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>but let.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's knock out some issues.</v>

227
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:14.964
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you already brought up the first </v>

228
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 1>thing that I wanted to discuss with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is black lives matter.</v>

229
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>So as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're from St Louis,</v>

230
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:23.250
<v Speaker 1>right next to Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this area.</v>

231
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 1>A couple of weeks ago I had larry elder </v>
<v Speaker 1>on who is,</v>

232
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.110
<v Speaker 1>who is the eye roll already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that side eye or eye roll?</v>

233
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:31.820
<v Speaker 1>It was</v>

234
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.690
<v Speaker 2>fit on his radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've debated these issues a lot.</v>

235
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand Larry,</v>

236
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.740
<v Speaker 2>to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bright Guy,</v>

237
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.810
<v Speaker 2>lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a turn,</v>

238
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.153
<v Speaker 2>talk show hosts radio talk show host.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his views are the most extreme </v>

239
00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine where he got them.</v>

240
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't wanna I don't wanna make this</v>

241
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 1>about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessary,</v>

242
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.200
<v Speaker 1>but the reason I mentioned it is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>a why I liked doing the shows.</v>

243
00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.043
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to people that believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing and somebody that believes </v>

244
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:02.164
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a great place for us to start </v>

245
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 1>because basically his take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put words in his mouth,</v>

246
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:07.384
<v Speaker 1>but to paraphrase him was he felt that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there really is no more systemic racism </v>

247
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:12.424
<v Speaker 1>in the United States and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really the struggle for the black </v>

248
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 1>community is because of the breakdown of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family.</v>

249
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.953
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to address that a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and then we can dive right into </v>

250
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:25.520
<v Speaker 1>really the nuts and bolts of the stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought</v>

251
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 2>really it can be more articulate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

252
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:28.894
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just going to say that's stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>a to say there's no longer systemic </v>

253
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:38.740
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ignore so much data,</v>

254
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 2>so many statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many reports,</v>

255
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

256
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 2>it ignores the fact that ignores the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality and conservatives like Larry,</v>

257
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.713
<v Speaker 2>like to deflect from those issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they can blame it on the </v>

258
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:55.204
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can blame it on the victims and </v>

259
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to accept any </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

260
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is the criminal justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

261
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:03.304
<v Speaker 2>let's just start there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disproportionate number of African </v>

262
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.623
<v Speaker 2>Americans and Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but particularly blacks who are </v>

263
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 2>incarcerated who have longer sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are treated differently,</v>

264
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:15.454
<v Speaker 2>everything from driving while black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who are racially profiled even when </v>

265
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:20.404
<v Speaker 2>they drive their cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've seen so many examples of this </v>

266
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Speaker 2>from high profile people like Chris </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rock.</v>

267
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Blake,</v>

268
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:31.370
<v Speaker 2>the tennis player who all have had some </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative experience.</v>

269
00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 2>The President Eric holder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was attorney general,</v>

270
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 2>talked about him and his brother being </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped in,</v>

271
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 2>in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

272
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Danny Glover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened with Danny Glover.</v>

273
00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:43.080
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't get a cab or something.</v>

274
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we could identify a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>man serious,</v>

275
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.653
<v Speaker 2>whether they're high profile celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional or just the guy on the </v>

276
00:13:52.921 --> 00:13:53.754
<v Speaker 2>street that hasn't had some negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience with the police simply </v>

277
00:13:57.301 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 2>because of their race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when folks like Larry Talk about,</v>

278
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're post racial society,</v>

279
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.460
<v Speaker 2>the facts are off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this wrong.</v>

280
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.410
<v Speaker 1>So what would you say about the family </v>
<v Speaker 1>part though?</v>

281
00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Because there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that as I say on the show</v>

282
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.340
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things can be true at once.</v>

283
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.640
<v Speaker 1>So everything that you've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fully make sense to me,</v>

284
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.850
<v Speaker 1>but also that the breakdown of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family in general,</v>

285
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.230
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>

286
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green is,</v>

287
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:22.050
<v Speaker 1>is a problem that we have.</v>

288
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:22.933
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he means when he says </v>

289
00:14:23.721 --> 00:14:26.630
<v Speaker 2>the breakdown of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think families have change.</v>

290
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about two gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

291
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.020
<v Speaker 2>individuals who are now parents because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't get married,</v>

292
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.950
<v Speaker 2>they can adopt the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't go to depot.</v>

293
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

294
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Well the reality is the family today </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't the family of the 1950.</v>

295
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.620
<v Speaker 2>So when they say the breakdown of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

296
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.663
<v Speaker 2>what family are they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Single moms are as common as two family </v>

297
00:14:48.261 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 2>households and are we to say that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a better structure?</v>

298
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.783
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure if even I buy into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>assertion that there's been some </v>

299
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 2>breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will agree.</v>

300
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 2>There's been an evolution and families </v>
<v Speaker 2>look very different today.</v>

301
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Interracial families couldn't exist for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 50 years ago.</v>

302
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.643
<v Speaker 2>Is that the breakdown of the family?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because now you and I could be married </v>

303
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:09.644
<v Speaker 2>and have kids.</v>

304
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Is that no longer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

305
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be the new thing,</v>

306
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 2>but you and I could decide to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child together,</v>

307
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:20.894
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

308
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Even though we're not married you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitro.</v>

309
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>families are created.</v>

310
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:30.710
<v Speaker 2>So when they say the breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they talking about it.</v>

311
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 2>So I don't buy into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

312
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.920
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good to hear.</v>

313
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.443
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's dive really into black lives </v>

314
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a movement,</v>

315
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.180
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of the General Movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself?</v>

316
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hitting the right tone.</v>

317
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say this and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get just slaughtered on social media.</v>

318
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:52.783
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow I become like the spokesperson </v>

319
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 2>for black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though,</v>

320
00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't enlisted me,</v>

321
00:15:58.101 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 2>they haven't called me on the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked me to do it,</v>

322
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 2>but I find myself trying to give some </v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

323
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>I think what black lives matter has done</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been nothing short of brilliant,</v>

324
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Speaker 2>the issue of race and race politics in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country,</v>

325
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.203
<v Speaker 2>very complex and all hands on deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I play a role as a civil rights </v>

326
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:18.674
<v Speaker 2>attorney that represents families who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been the victims of any kind of </v>

327
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:23.504
<v Speaker 2>police violence or they've had their </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights violated their constitutional </v>

328
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:26.834
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I stepped in as a lawyer and I </v>

329
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:29.140
<v Speaker 2>represent those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I,</v>

330
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 2>I have this platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives a talk on television every week</v>

331
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:36.890
<v Speaker 2>about these high profile cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get to lend my voice to that.</v>

332
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Then there are these people who go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they march and they protest and Hook</v>

333
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.620
<v Speaker 2>as a result of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So folks in the courtroom,</v>

334
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 2>folks using their platform on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

335
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.973
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks like Al Sharpton using his voice </v>

336
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:51.854
<v Speaker 2>and then these protesters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the issue of police profiling a </v>

337
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.253
<v Speaker 2>police shootings of African Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been elevated to this national </v>

338
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:02.630
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

339
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter have had audiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Hillary Clinton,</v>

340
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders.</v>

341
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.253
<v Speaker 2>It's come up in the presidential debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we've got to give those </v>

342
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:15.650
<v Speaker 2>protests or some credit for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

343
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:16.484
<v Speaker 2>but for their activism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this issue would not have become a part </v>

344
00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:21.344
<v Speaker 2>of the national dialogue that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having about how do we make communities </v>

345
00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:25.620
<v Speaker 2>safer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did,</v>

346
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:30.230
<v Speaker 2>what did you make of the instance when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the two protesters went up to Bernie's a</v>

347
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.160
<v Speaker 2>podium and basically grabbed the mic </v>
<v Speaker 2>from him?</v>

348
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.710
<v Speaker 2>He sort of let them do it because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people felt that that was like,</v>

349
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about identity politics a lot and</v>

350
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:39.764
<v Speaker 2>that my problem with identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>is I find everyone has to figure out </v>

351
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:44.540
<v Speaker 2>who's the most aggrieved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your autumn,</v>

352
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Bernie is an ally obviously of the black</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives matter movement.</v>

353
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>He's an ally of the other always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

354
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>if everyone is always looking out just </v>
<v Speaker 1>for themselves,</v>

355
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 1>then you have the right in your mind to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab the mic away from him.</v>

356
00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Who even though he's as left as it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>

357
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 1>get in politics in America</v>

358
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.573
<v Speaker 2>now to say that I support what black </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives matter has done in terms of </v>

359
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 2>elevating this conversation to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>national level.</v>

360
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:10.620
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean I agree with everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do.</v>

361
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 2>What I like for them to approach Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

362
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I feel good about watching him try </v>

363
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:21.540
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what do I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I call security,</v>

364
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:25.110
<v Speaker 2>do I have them escorted and then kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's unfair about that.</v>

365
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.900
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have secret service </v>
<v Speaker 2>protection.</v>

366
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.853
<v Speaker 2>The reality is they wouldn't have even </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten here that microphone or a stage </v>

367
00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:34.284
<v Speaker 2>had that been Hillary Clinton or Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump or any of the other candidates </v>

368
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:41.510
<v Speaker 2>that trump has secret service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has plenty of have security.</v>

369
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.860
<v Speaker 2>So the reality is Bernie in allowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself to be open,</v>

370
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.713
<v Speaker 2>kind of left himself open to these hyper</v>
<v Speaker 2>protest or so I didn't like that bottom </v>

371
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like that,</v>

372
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:57.020
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't take away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overall efforts that they've had and the</v>

373
00:18:57.241 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 2>successes that they've had.</v>

374
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.143
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that we have to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with this concept of </v>

375
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:09.651
<v Speaker 2>disruption and that's what I think is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>upsetting to a lot of people.</v>

376
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:11.004
<v Speaker 2>Even African Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even traditional African American civil </v>

377
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 2>rights leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want black lives matter to fit into</v>

378
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 2>this box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want them to follow the mode of the</v>

379
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 2>19 fifties and 19 sixties protestors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

380
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 2>hell no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not who we are.</v>

381
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.540
<v Speaker 2>We're not looking for Martin Luther King</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come and save us and to lead us.</v>

382
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.673
<v Speaker 2>This is a movement of the people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people and it's being done totally </v>

383
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:36.291
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>

384
00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:41.291
<v Speaker 2>They're not looking to organize in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that John Lewis and a lot of those civil</v>

385
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:42.144
<v Speaker 2>rights leaders did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a little unsettling </v>

386
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get it.</v>

387
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:46.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting sort of </v>

388
00:19:47.091 --> 00:19:47.924
<v Speaker 1>generational struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously John Lewis and Martin Luther </v>

389
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.890
<v Speaker 1>King and Malcolm x and many other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>did things at different levels,</v>

390
00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:57.740
<v Speaker 1>some on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some via speaking and all that.</v>

391
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And I find that this movement hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite figured out what it is yet.</v>

392
00:20:01.671 --> 00:20:04.460
<v Speaker 1>But I think your point is that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of,</v>

393
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.383
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the magic that's the part of </v>

394
00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:07.964
<v Speaker 2>this new paradigm that literally you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on twitter and organize a thousand </v>

395
00:20:11.871 --> 00:20:12.704
<v Speaker 2>people to show up at a rally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes at that rally it and my </v>

396
00:20:16.161 --> 00:20:16.994
<v Speaker 2>daughter has been so there was a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>rally last year after Thanksgiving in </v>

397
00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>

398
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.600
<v Speaker 2>some people had this sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people had that sign.</v>

399
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.463
<v Speaker 2>There was really no organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even sure if people knew why </v>

400
00:20:30.231 --> 00:20:32.440
<v Speaker 2>they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he caught fire on facebook.</v>

401
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.050
<v Speaker 2>It caught fire on twitter and thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people showed up and I says,</v>

402
00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:37.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get used to that.</v>

403
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.893
<v Speaker 2>That's a part of the unorganized nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it is what makes it special and what </v>

404
00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:45.140
<v Speaker 2>makes it unique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>

405
00:20:45.141 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 2>some people were there for gay rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people were for human rights,</v>

406
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:49.750
<v Speaker 2>some people were there for sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>trafficking,</v>

407
00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 2>some people were there for police </v>
<v Speaker 2>brutality.</v>

408
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were all people who were at the</v>

409
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>end of the day just trying to make their</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

410
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 2>their communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people they care about have a better</v>

411
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 2>quality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for that I have,</v>

412
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.203
<v Speaker 1>so interestingly there could be sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could be the genesis of setting </v>

413
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 1>sort of much bigger because when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take all those people,</v>

414
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 1>and again this is where my thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics is sort of interesting</v>

415
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:14.254
<v Speaker 1>because everyone's got their issue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet they're coming together so that's </v>

416
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:22.450
<v Speaker 1>good in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm afraid that that it allows for a</v>

417
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:23.284
<v Speaker 1>lot of issues to then just jump on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of each other when some of these things </v>

418
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 1>aren't necessarily connected,</v>

419
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.410
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's the alternative?</v>

420
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I say to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

421
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 2>you don't like how black lives matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>has address this police brutality issue,</v>

422
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.773
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to give them some credit for </v>

423
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:41.194
<v Speaker 2>all of the legislation that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the federal level and state by state </v>

424
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.063
<v Speaker 2>requiring body cams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>California just passed a law now that </v>

425
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:54.130
<v Speaker 2>says a special prosecutor has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>appointed if there is a police shooting.</v>

426
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.173
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have seen the fruits of their labor </v>

427
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.670
<v Speaker 2>and I say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me an alternative.</v>

428
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.633
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in your worldview at or if you </v>

429
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 2>could wave a magic wand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would it look?</v>

430
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

431
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:09.401
<v Speaker 1>I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

432
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:09.881
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

433
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

434
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find they're philosophically.</v>

435
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.393
<v Speaker 1>There's something to me that seems a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little dangerous if everyone sort of </v>

436
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 1>jumping on the social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social justice things,</v>

437
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 1>but I do hear you.</v>

438
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see anyone else.</v>

439
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:30.480
<v Speaker 2>And the black lives matter protesters </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you talk about generation.</v>

440
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.830
<v Speaker 2>They said Al Sharpton and some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other civil rights movements,</v>

441
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders,</v>

442
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:41.150
<v Speaker 2>what they do is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really are about grassroots there,</v>

443
00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:45.030
<v Speaker 2>about local people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous leadership.</v>

444
00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:45.864
<v Speaker 2>So people in their own communities </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up and demanding that they get </v>

445
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.300
<v Speaker 2>a voice at the table when decisions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being made.</v>

446
00:22:54.301 --> 00:22:55.134
<v Speaker 2>Like who's going to be the police chief?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to be the district attorney </v>

447
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.490
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would say is what I hope to see,</v>

448
00:23:02.491 --> 00:23:05.130
<v Speaker 2>and I was disappointed in the midterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections last time.</v>

449
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.400
<v Speaker 2>How do we translate all of this social </v>
<v Speaker 2>activism into electoral politics?</v>

450
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.010
<v Speaker 2>How do we get those thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that showed up for a rally?</v>

451
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.760
<v Speaker 2>How do we get them to vote in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>election and beyond?</v>

452
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you talk a lot about local politics.</v>

453
00:23:19.671 --> 00:23:20.504
<v Speaker 1>So I can backing up for a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give you an example where I </v>

454
00:23:22.191 --> 00:23:24.290
<v Speaker 1>think it's a bit of a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

455
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.303
<v Speaker 1>what we're seeing on college campuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now with free speech now I get </v>

456
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.860
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thrust of what they're doing,</v>

457
00:23:30.861 --> 00:23:33.530
<v Speaker 1>they're standing up for social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want equality.</v>

458
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.240
<v Speaker 1>We're not just talking about the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

459
00:23:35.241 --> 00:23:39.140
<v Speaker 1>the gay community where whoever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I understand the idea there.</v>

460
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you see the instances like</v>

461
00:23:41.331 --> 00:23:45.850
<v Speaker 1>at Yale where they're shouting down this</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor and that they're,</v>

462
00:23:45.851 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're demanding professors be fired.</v>

463
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.823
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that we've created a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation here where the students are </v>

464
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:53.084
<v Speaker 1>now dictating the policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it seems a little backwards and I </v>

465
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 1>know that there's a lot of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia that are,</v>

466
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 1>that are really afraid of where this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>

467
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.730
<v Speaker 2>But they're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're 19,</v>

468
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.340
<v Speaker 2>and think about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

469
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.750
<v Speaker 2>what should you be doing at college?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what those students are doing,</v>

470
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.600
<v Speaker 1>well you should exchanging ideas but not</v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding that professors be fired.</v>

471
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the professors are are racist and the</v>

472
00:24:15.421 --> 00:24:19.260
<v Speaker 2>professors are not sensitive to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue of inclusion and diversity,</v>

473
00:24:19.261 --> 00:24:20.670
<v Speaker 2>why not them that they'd be fired.</v>

474
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel that that professor at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yale,</v>

475
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the he,</v>

476
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.763
<v Speaker 1>he was the dean of that college and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife had written the letter about the </v>

477
00:24:28.121 --> 00:24:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Halloween costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

478
00:24:29.531 --> 00:24:31.030
<v Speaker 1>to me it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:24:31.031 --> 00:24:32.440
<v Speaker 1>if they don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

480
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.730
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem for me</v>

481
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.470
<v Speaker 3>and any</v>

482
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:37.803
<v Speaker 2>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime you're trying to transform an </v>

483
00:24:40.361 --> 00:24:41.194
<v Speaker 2>organization that has had systemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>racial inequality and injustices for </v>

484
00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:47.434
<v Speaker 2>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is somebody going to get somebody going </v>

485
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.300
<v Speaker 2>to be sacrificed that perhaps really </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't the person?</v>

486
00:24:55.301 --> 00:24:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to be scapegoated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

487
00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:58.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why is a university like University </v>

488
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.370
<v Speaker 2>of Missouri that all predominantly black</v>
<v Speaker 2>football team,</v>

489
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.700
<v Speaker 2>if they hadn't stood up and stood with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>

490
00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:10.534
<v Speaker 2>Johnathan Butler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who went on the hunger strike if they </v>

491
00:25:12.551 --> 00:25:15.220
<v Speaker 2>hadn't stood up with those students?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt</v>

492
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.220
<v Speaker 2>if Jonathan was still be on that hunger </v>
<v Speaker 2>strike,</v>

493
00:25:18.221 --> 00:25:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll be dead by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt that unit.</v>

494
00:25:20.171 --> 00:25:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that case nobody responded so but,</v>

495
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.780
<v Speaker 2>but why is it a public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>university of Missouri,</v>

496
00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:27.490
<v Speaker 2>like seven percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five percent,</v>

497
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.400
<v Speaker 2>such a low percentage of African </v>
<v Speaker 2>American students.</v>

498
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.413
<v Speaker 2>Why does it take us to get to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the students have to shout down </v>

499
00:25:34.961 --> 00:25:35.794
<v Speaker 2>the professors for the universities to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at themselves and say there's </v>

500
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.673
<v Speaker 2>something wrong with this picture is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflective of the community where this </v>

501
00:25:42.701 --> 00:25:43.534
<v Speaker 2>school is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you remember that University of </v>

502
00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a president,</v>

503
00:25:46.841 --> 00:25:47.674
<v Speaker 2>he's in his parade and he was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrogant and he wouldn't even address </v>

504
00:25:50.651 --> 00:25:51.940
<v Speaker 2>those students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did he.</v>

505
00:25:51.941 --> 00:25:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Did he end up stepping down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They forced him out.</v>

506
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

507
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.600
<v Speaker 1>So interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Missouri and the yellow ones,</v>

508
00:25:57.601 --> 00:25:59.100
<v Speaker 1>which happened basically at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

509
00:25:59.101 --> 00:26:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I see as to what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me at the Yale thing was,</v>

510
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.540
<v Speaker 1>was far worse than Missouri thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

511
00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:04.374
<v Speaker 1>Had the mostly black football team not </v>
<v Speaker 1>got involved then nothing would have </v>

512
00:26:08.341 --> 00:26:09.420
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do hear that.</v>

513
00:26:09.421 --> 00:26:11.490
<v Speaker 1>But even in that instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:26:11.491 --> 00:26:13.710
<v Speaker 1>there was that professor or a part time </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

515
00:26:13.711 --> 00:26:14.544
<v Speaker 1>that woman who came out and got caught </v>
<v Speaker 1>on camera saying we need some muscle </v>

516
00:26:17.371 --> 00:26:20.160
<v Speaker 1>here and then that isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a free speech issue.</v>

517
00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that goes to your earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

518
00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.640
<v Speaker 1>which is you can be for a movement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you agree with every,</v>

519
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.893
<v Speaker 1>every tech,</v>

520
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.760
<v Speaker 2>some of the tactics are not well thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

521
00:26:30.761 --> 00:26:32.080
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I said they're 18,</v>

522
00:26:32.081 --> 00:26:34.000
<v Speaker 2>they're 19 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is their first.</v>

523
00:26:34.001 --> 00:26:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Some of them first experience with any </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of unrest or any kind of protest.</v>

524
00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:39.483
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't expect their thoughts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be as developed by their tactics to be </v>

525
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 2>as developed as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody is 30 or 40 or beyond.</v>

526
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 2>So I think we have to just accept that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these are teenagers just kind of finding</v>

527
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:57.060
<v Speaker 2>their way in and young adults who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>finding their way on some pretty complex</v>

528
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:57.923
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think more importantly for me is </v>

529
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.490
<v Speaker 2>if I'm a university president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

530
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 2>why I'd be more proactive on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

531
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.743
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't I addressing issues of </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity and inclusion before it </v>

532
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:12.414
<v Speaker 2>bubbles up and now I have the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest that we've seen on campuses </v>

533
00:27:15.121 --> 00:27:15.954
<v Speaker 2>across this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just don't think a lot of these </v>

534
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:21.100
<v Speaker 2>folks have been very smart about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue of diversity,</v>

535
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.880
<v Speaker 2>a diversity and inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we could segue into the Oscars.</v>

536
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Very good example of that.</v>

537
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Let me throw in one other thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go ask,</v>

538
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.913
<v Speaker 1>but this is exactly why I wanted to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this because I think that </v>

539
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:35.424
<v Speaker 1>basically the bulk of the same people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of this country pretty much </v>

540
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:40.254
<v Speaker 1>see these things in a similar way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even just what we're doing right </v>

541
00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows that there are,</v>

542
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 1>there are different ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean someone else's racist or</v>

543
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:48.774
<v Speaker 1>someone else's automatically a bigot or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we're so used to using </v>

544
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:51.700
<v Speaker 1>those words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

545
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.970
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I wanted to unfurl somebody</v>

546
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.580
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately we can't sit down.</v>

547
00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:57.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what kind of dialogue </v>

548
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.540
<v Speaker 2>because those words that you use just </v>
<v Speaker 2>shuts the conversation down.</v>

549
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of one other piece on this and </v>

550
00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:07.870
<v Speaker 1>then we'll move to the Oscars is my </v>
<v Speaker 1>guest last week,</v>

551
00:28:07.871 --> 00:28:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a thinker and a skeptic.</v>

552
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.270
<v Speaker 1>He made an interesting point about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>college thing where he said to me,</v>

553
00:28:13.271 --> 00:28:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these kids at Yale,</v>

554
00:28:15.071 --> 00:28:15.904
<v Speaker 1>if at this point what they're protesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about his halloween costumes that might </v>

555
00:28:19.871 --> 00:28:20.704
<v Speaker 1>offend them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that actually shows great progress </v>

556
00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:24.364
<v Speaker 1>in society because of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have had to protest 30 years </v>

557
00:28:27.161 --> 00:28:27.994
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that actually gave me a </v>

558
00:28:29.411 --> 00:28:30.244
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a nice feeling to sort of take </v>

559
00:28:32.891 --> 00:28:35.950
<v Speaker 1>away from this that it doesn't mean that</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems don't exist,</v>

560
00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.750
<v Speaker 1>but it means that we actually have moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in society and we don't.</v>

561
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.643
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes we don't stop and </v>

562
00:28:42.281 --> 00:28:42.970
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge.</v>

563
00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:43.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think Obama did a great job of </v>

564
00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:50.191
<v Speaker 2>that when they had the march on the John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pettus bridge in Selma and he says,</v>

565
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:56.350
<v Speaker 2>as much work as there is to do on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question of race in America,</v>

566
00:28:56.351 --> 00:29:00.640
<v Speaker 2>we cannot lose sight of the tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress that has been made.</v>

567
00:29:00.641 --> 00:29:03.460
<v Speaker 2>So I would agree with Michael on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point that yes,</v>

568
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.593
<v Speaker 2>they weren't protesting because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't eat in the same cafeteria or </v>

569
00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:10.780
<v Speaker 2>drink from the same water fountain as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the white students.</v>

570
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Now the issues of race and they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

571
00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:14.560
<v Speaker 2>They are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more subtle.</v>

572
00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.693
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more in some ways in city is </v>

573
00:29:17.441 --> 00:29:18.274
<v Speaker 2>because they're not overt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the colored only signs made it real </v>

574
00:29:21.491 --> 00:29:23.950
<v Speaker 2>clear what our mission was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

575
00:29:23.951 --> 00:29:26.740
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't much dispute about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now you're right,</v>

576
00:29:26.741 --> 00:29:27.574
<v Speaker 2>because even again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>African Americans are often divided on </v>

577
00:29:29.921 --> 00:29:30.754
<v Speaker 2>this question and I've sat on drew's </v>
<v Speaker 2>couch with some conservative African </v>

578
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Americans who say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry,</v>

579
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.110
<v Speaker 2>what are they complaining about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

580
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.630
<v Speaker 2>they were in the college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

581
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 2>work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get good grades and everything will work</v>

582
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:47.560
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people aren't,</v>

583
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking from one voice on this issue of</v>

584
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:51.870
<v Speaker 2>race because it's important.</v>

585
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know I said last thing,</v>

586
00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna throw in one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just jumping off that.</v>

587
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make in general of,</v>

588
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.953
<v Speaker 1>of black conservatives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm friends with a few black </v>

589
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Webb,</v>

590
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 1>who's a Sirius xm host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a Fox News contributor,</v>

591
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.703
<v Speaker 1>is a good friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We worked together at Sirius and I know </v>

592
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:10.520
<v Speaker 1>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know him extremely well and I,</v>

593
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had drinks together.</v>

594
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 1>We make dinner together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that he believes what he's saying</v>

595
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I see what people say about him</v>

596
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:19.840
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 1>uncle Tom and we could go through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>list of things that people say,</v>

598
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wh,</v>

599
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of people like that?</v>

600
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.780
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think David and any black Republican,</v>

601
00:30:30.781 --> 00:30:32.730
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however they identify themselves,</v>

602
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.553
<v Speaker 2>they're perfectly within their right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the opinions that they have about </v>

603
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.833
<v Speaker 2>race and politics and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to identify with the GOP party or </v>

604
00:30:42.691 --> 00:30:43.524
<v Speaker 2>the independent party or whatever party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't come from a place that </v>

605
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:50.100
<v Speaker 2>because you're black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to agree with everything that I</v>

606
00:30:50.101 --> 00:30:55.101
<v Speaker 2>believe in or because you're gay or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that there is no monolithic thought</v>

607
00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.093
<v Speaker 2>in any of these communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That people have different points of </v>

608
00:30:59.101 --> 00:30:59.934
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like a conversation where all of </v>

609
00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:06.030
<v Speaker 2>those points of views have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to present themselves and to</v>

610
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:06.864
<v Speaker 2>be a part of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that because David or </v>

611
00:31:10.111 --> 00:31:10.944
<v Speaker 2>Larry or any of those conservatives have</v>
<v Speaker 2>their view about the family that that </v>

612
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.810
<v Speaker 2>view is any less significant than my </v>
<v Speaker 2>view because I don't see it the way they</v>

613
00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:20.790
<v Speaker 2>see it doesn't mean that their points on</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

614
00:31:20.791 --> 00:31:24.990
<v Speaker 2>So I like debating those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like talking to those guys and I think</v>

615
00:31:24.991 --> 00:31:29.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a mistake to try to shut their </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech down or to try to silence them.</v>

616
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 2>The silence who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

617
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.080
<v Speaker 2>some people call these lefties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these super progressive.</v>

618
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:36.543
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

619
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thrilled with those guys either,</v>

620
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:38.944
<v Speaker 1>but bring it on a whole other topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a perfect segway now to the </v>

621
00:31:42.251 --> 00:31:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Oscars so white situation because Fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>News had stacey dash on who is black and</v>

622
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:49.480
<v Speaker 1>she was saying to the black community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just like,</v>

623
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 1>get over it that this is not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing.</v>

624
00:31:51.851 --> 00:31:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So that we have decided that we all take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deal and give.</v>

625
00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:02.490
<v Speaker 1>We will take you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fair trade.</v>

626
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Basically our number one white person </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

627
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:09.730
<v Speaker 1>and you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take.</v>

628
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Stacy was in one movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in 1995.</v>

629
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're getting.</v>

630
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Can we get a draft pick or we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dale,</v>

631
00:32:17.641 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants a deal that was</v>

632
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.493
<v Speaker 2>on black twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just the power of social media space </v>

633
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.063
<v Speaker 2>is entitled to her opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't necessarily put stacy in </v>

634
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 2>this category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know her personally,</v>

635
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:32.074
<v Speaker 2>but there are people of every race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every persuasion that have branded </v>

636
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 2>themselves as we started this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation as experts,</v>

637
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.773
<v Speaker 2>they like the attention that they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>from saying outlandish things that they </v>

638
00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 2>like to be provocative on topics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is her,</v>

639
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:49.850
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know her personally,</v>

640
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.360
<v Speaker 2>but I do know because I sit in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair and I sit on these shows,</v>

641
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five times a week and some of </v>

642
00:32:56.091 --> 00:33:01.091
<v Speaker 2>these folks I know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally trying to be provocative,</v>

643
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 2>but she may believe that African </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans should get over it.</v>

644
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:06.614
<v Speaker 2>I say again to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's misguided in her thoughts and her </v>

645
00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:10.160
<v Speaker 2>statements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

646
00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 2>and you have to look at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of this happens in a vacuum.</v>

647
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.880
<v Speaker 2>And for those folks who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what about the naacp image awards,</v>

648
00:33:16.881 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 2>they're all black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what about bt?</v>

649
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:20.144
<v Speaker 2>It's all black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are white actors complaining about </v>

650
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:23.941
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

651
00:33:23.941 --> 00:33:25.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his look at the history,</v>

652
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 2>why is there an NAACP?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are there Naacp Image Award?</v>

653
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.551
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

654
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:32.384
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem with her saying </v>

655
00:33:33.051 --> 00:33:33.681
<v Speaker 1>whatever she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

656
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:34.840
<v Speaker 1>if she believes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

657
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.010
<v Speaker 1>even if she's just saying it to say it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's on television,</v>

658
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the game at some level as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying.</v>

659
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.780
<v Speaker 1>And if she believes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she believes it.</v>

660
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.943
<v Speaker 1>I thought the one part that was a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>odd really was that she said that we </v>

661
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:50.330
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have a black history month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which every part of our culture,</v>

662
00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:52.070
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should have a black history month and</v>

663
00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:55.490
<v Speaker 1>we should have a Latino history month </v>
<v Speaker 1>then probably going to get history,</v>

664
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.590
<v Speaker 2>do away with everything that identifies </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a celebration.</v>

665
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's culture.</v>

666
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with Columbus Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

667
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:05.050
<v Speaker 1>So Oscar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so white here.</v>

668
00:34:05.051 --> 00:34:07.900
<v Speaker 1>So here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a big Brouhaha right now,</v>

669
00:34:07.901 --> 00:34:09.550
<v Speaker 1>we got a Hashtag on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone,</v>

670
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the black community is not </v>

671
00:34:12.491 --> 00:34:14.340
<v Speaker 1>happy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

672
00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I should say right up front that Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock,</v>

673
00:34:16.151 --> 00:34:16.984
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's going to host the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said he's still going to host it is </v>

674
00:34:18.971 --> 00:34:21.080
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president of the academy is Black,</v>

675
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.600
<v Speaker 1>but I think 94 percent of the voters are</v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

676
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm getting that 94 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the academy.</v>

677
00:34:28.541 --> 00:34:29.374
<v Speaker 1>The academy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy seven percent of the voters are </v>

678
00:34:31.121 --> 00:34:32.330
<v Speaker 1>white male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

679
00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.660
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some numbers now.</v>

680
00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:35.494
<v Speaker 1>I also saw some numbers that were that </v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2000 that pretty much it's been </v>

681
00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:41.344
<v Speaker 1>about a that the black community America</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about 10 percent or about 12 percent </v>

682
00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:47.920
<v Speaker 1>and they've gotten about 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nomination,</v>

683
00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:50.320
<v Speaker 1>so that since 2000 that it basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>works out.</v>

684
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just throwing out some numbers to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

685
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.440
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

686
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love protests.</v>

687
00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Let me just start here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell that you're telling because</v>

688
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.750
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Cheryl Boone Isaacs came out and said</v>

689
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.480
<v Speaker 2>change needs to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it needs to happen faster.</v>

690
00:35:07.481 --> 00:35:09.340
<v Speaker 2>She was frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was heartbroken.</v>

691
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.103
<v Speaker 2>A Jade Pinkett Smith did her facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>video to her 7 million viewers a and we </v>

692
00:35:18.431 --> 00:35:21.460
<v Speaker 2>have spike Lee make his statement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what happened?</v>

693
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.413
<v Speaker 2>There was an emergency meeting on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda was this issue of diversity for </v>

694
00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:26.944
<v Speaker 2>the academy and out of that emergency </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting came some commitments that were </v>

695
00:35:30.821 --> 00:35:31.654
<v Speaker 2>pretty significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're going to diversify our </v>

696
00:35:34.991 --> 00:35:36.970
<v Speaker 2>membership by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

697
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.823
<v Speaker 2>we're going to add more women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to add more minorities and </v>

698
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:41.694
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity a bigger issue for the </v>

699
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:47.340
<v Speaker 2>academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it makes sense.</v>

700
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.301
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't tell you this,</v>

701
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I went to Harvard for law school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my major in college was economics.</v>

702
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.870
<v Speaker 2>So some of this stuff just boils down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

703
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 2>So you want it to be an actress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an economics major.</v>

704
00:35:58.621 --> 00:35:59.454
<v Speaker 2>So look at the facts here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last year they said the ratings down 16 </v>

705
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:05.394
<v Speaker 2>percent and a lot of that was attributed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to last year when there were no black </v>

706
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.230
<v Speaker 2>nominees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that Hashtag trended Oscar.</v>

707
00:36:11.231 --> 00:36:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Oscars Cheryl,</v>

708
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.750
<v Speaker 2>they got a job to do it at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day,</v>

709
00:36:15.751 --> 00:36:20.640
<v Speaker 2>they got to sell a television program to</v>
<v Speaker 2>one network and the network has to bring</v>

710
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:23.670
<v Speaker 2>in sponsors and advertisers to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of money.</v>

711
00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.813
<v Speaker 2>So imagine if that 16 percent grew to 25</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent because high profile African </v>

712
00:36:29.651 --> 00:36:30.484
<v Speaker 2>Americans like Spike Lee and will smith </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Marlon Wayans and Jaden Pinkett </v>

713
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Smith all said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to watch.</v>

714
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not attending.</v>

715
00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:39.663
<v Speaker 1>And to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there were more black people </v>

716
00:36:41.141 --> 00:36:41.974
<v Speaker 1>nominated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like suddenly white people </v>

717
00:36:42.671 --> 00:36:43.051
<v Speaker 1>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

718
00:36:43.051 --> 00:36:43.884
<v Speaker 1>I'm not watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were some more black nominees is </v>

719
00:36:46.151 --> 00:36:46.984
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think there's a little risk </v>

720
00:36:48.491 --> 00:36:49.324
<v Speaker 1>though in that this is forgetting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics side of it and we know there's </v>

721
00:36:52.001 --> 00:36:55.900
<v Speaker 1>plenty of politics in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that these are subjective award,</v>

722
00:36:55.901 --> 00:36:58.180
<v Speaker 1>so it is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it is possible?</v>

723
00:36:58.181 --> 00:37:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I should say that the people voted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just happened to the votes?</v>

724
00:37:03.161 --> 00:37:03.994
<v Speaker 1>Just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't think that that's a </v>

725
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:06.363
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

726
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.553
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what we're hearing is that the </v>

727
00:37:10.591 --> 00:37:11.424
<v Speaker 2>membership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get to watch whatever movies they </v>

728
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:16.440
<v Speaker 2>choose to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm a 78 year old white guy,</v>

729
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got all these movies to watch,</v>

730
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 2>what are the chances that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch straight Outta Compton?</v>

731
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.733
<v Speaker 2>It's just not likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's what African Americans </v>

732
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:26.620
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>

733
00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.120
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not necessarily.</v>

734
00:37:28.121 --> 00:37:28.954
<v Speaker 1>So that's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say that sort of racist by </v>

735
00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:31.500
<v Speaker 1>omission.</v>

736
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.420
<v Speaker 2>So there a bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the city,</v>

737
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.140
<v Speaker 2>that's why diversity matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of us as well,</v>

738
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.000
<v Speaker 2>we don't want affirmative action for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>awards.</v>

739
00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want affirmative action.</v>

740
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.770
<v Speaker 2>We just want the academy to reflect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality of movie goers.</v>

741
00:37:46.341 --> 00:37:51.341
<v Speaker 2>So 46 percent of all tickets sold at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>box office from minorities.</v>

742
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>So if the people buying your product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by and large,</v>

743
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.550
<v Speaker 2>all we're saying is let the academy </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflect those people.</v>

744
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.560
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if an African American or Latino decides</v>

745
00:38:03.561 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 2>to straight Outta Compton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a movie that they want to vote for</v>

746
00:38:07.231 --> 00:38:08.850
<v Speaker 2>it to be best picture of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

747
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.120
<v Speaker 2>We can live with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not asking them to get any special</v>

748
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:12.954
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All we're asking for is diversity so </v>

749
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 2>that at least there's some confidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the process is fair.</v>

750
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Even the plainfield don't give us any </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater advantages.</v>

751
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.023
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Viola David says is best the difference </v>

752
00:38:24.691 --> 00:38:29.070
<v Speaker 2>between black women in TV and white </v>
<v Speaker 2>women are the opportunities,</v>

753
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:29.993
<v Speaker 2>so we're really just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities and spike Lee I think was </v>

754
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:37.270
<v Speaker 2>spot on saying this way before we get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the award seasons.</v>

755
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.103
<v Speaker 2>This is happening in the c suites at </v>
<v Speaker 2>studios because when we look at who can </v>

756
00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:45.770
<v Speaker 2>green light projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where we've got to start.</v>

757
00:38:45.771 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 2>There's no diversity is no Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he told me that.</v>

758
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:48.943
<v Speaker 2>I think he said there's one African </v>
<v Speaker 2>American that has the power to green </v>

759
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:52.924
<v Speaker 2>light a project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it starts with a major studio </v>

760
00:38:56.051 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A major studio,</v>

761
00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:58.810
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously not independent films,</v>

762
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 2>but it starts with those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number of and will be Goldberg,</v>

763
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 2>talked about this on the view as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>director and an executive producer,</v>

764
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 2>is that the black directors and writers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and producers,</v>

765
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 2>they cannot get their projects through </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream studios and when they do,</v>

766
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.053
<v Speaker 2>their budgets are smaller and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities for success on those </v>

767
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 2>projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just again,</v>

768
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go back to my economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

769
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to that.</v>

770
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 2>You'll have straight out of compton </v>
<v Speaker 2>making $200,000,000.</v>

771
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:31.980
<v Speaker 2>You have ride along three pushing star </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars out of the top slot.</v>

772
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I think somebody ought to take note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bean counters,</v>

773
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 2>the accountants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money people ought to be taking note</v>

774
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:42.910
<v Speaker 2>of that and and ought to do what TV has </v>
<v Speaker 2>done to recognize,</v>

775
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.660
<v Speaker 2>hey there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some money in these urban movies</v>

776
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.553
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that's the interesting part </v>

777
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:49.474
<v Speaker 1>because if I know one thing about now </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in La and being part of the </v>

778
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:52.743
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood or whatever this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that this town I think basically is </v>

779
00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:59.290
<v Speaker 1>just run by people want to make money </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

780
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 1>that it's a capitalistic town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like.</v>

781
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So your argument though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would would prove if they said,</v>

782
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 1>all right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at the numbers here,</v>

783
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:11.800
<v Speaker 1>46 percent of the people that are coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>to movies are minorities.</v>

784
00:40:11.801 --> 00:40:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Then we should be trying to increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>that percentage of the pie.</v>

785
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:18.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to come at the cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily have your white viewers that</v>

786
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I think the town would be would go for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because they want to make money.</v>

787
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.770
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's the fear.</v>

788
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.793
<v Speaker 2>You hit on something really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're seeing that in the </v>

789
00:40:26.471 --> 00:40:29.300
<v Speaker 2>presidential election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fear that if,</v>

790
00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.590
<v Speaker 2>if I make way for you African American </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority,</v>

791
00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 2>somehow that means there's no way for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

792
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:36.663
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your success comes at my expense and </v>

793
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:41.410
<v Speaker 2>this is also what you should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned.</v>

794
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have about this town is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very relationship driven.</v>

795
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.963
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't have that relationship with </v>

796
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily even going to get in</v>

797
00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:51.484
<v Speaker 2>the room to have the meeting and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to spike Lee's point if we don't have </v>

798
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:56.283
<v Speaker 2>more diversity in the top jobs and upper</v>
<v Speaker 2>level management in the decision making </v>

799
00:41:01.121 --> 00:41:04.030
<v Speaker 2>positions than maybe I've never even in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation.</v>

800
00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:04.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

801
00:41:04.471 --> 00:41:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw our friend Larry Elder,</v>

802
00:41:06.271 --> 00:41:08.340
<v Speaker 1>who we've mentioned a few times here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

803
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I saw he was tweeting at spike and </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically was saying,</v>

804
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.541
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spike.</v>

805
00:41:12.541 --> 00:41:14.040
<v Speaker 1>You've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

806
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:14.874
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're selling your mansion in New York </v>

807
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:19.380
<v Speaker 1>for $35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million bucks.</v>

808
00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:20.363
<v Speaker 1>It's a little disingenuous for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think I know what you're going to </v>

809
00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:24.253
<v Speaker 1>say to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's interesting that it's </v>

810
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.990
<v Speaker 1>good at least that any community is </v>
<v Speaker 1>having those internal fight that.</v>

811
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.040
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how ridiculous that argument is.</v>

812
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.280
<v Speaker 1>You can sit here and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eva,</v>

813
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your son</v>

814
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.053
<v Speaker 2>has autism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're standing up fighting for </v>

815
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 2>more autistics are services for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with autism.</v>

816
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 2>That's just about enriching your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>son's life.</v>

817
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.273
<v Speaker 2>Oftentimes it's people's own personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that causes them to become </v>

818
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.343
<v Speaker 2>advocates or activists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is because of spike Lee's </v>

819
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:51.704
<v Speaker 2>position inside the movie industry that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he has the voice and the credibility to </v>

820
00:41:55.731 --> 00:41:56.564
<v Speaker 2>speak to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I surely don't have any credible voice </v>

821
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 2>about making a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never made a damn movie.</v>

822
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:03.400
<v Speaker 2>So who wants to hear from me about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to make a movie?</v>

823
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make a movie.</v>

824
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about the folks that make</v>
<v Speaker 2>that better,</v>

825
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:09.613
<v Speaker 2>but I think his argument is disingenuous</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think spike Lee is in the best </v>

826
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:17.690
<v Speaker 2>position and he's been on this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not new to this party.</v>

827
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:22.010
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the history of spike Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spike Lee will tell you lots of projects</v>

828
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:22.844
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get because he's always been </v>
<v Speaker 2>outspoken about this issue of race and </v>

829
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:28.274
<v Speaker 2>diversity and inclusion and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's made a lot of money and make more </v>

830
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:32.054
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

831
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.073
<v Speaker 2>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spike is fighting the same fight in </v>

832
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:37.640
<v Speaker 2>reality that a lot of his movies were </v>
<v Speaker 2>about fighting made.</v>

833
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 2>His moves are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's coming out of nowhere with this and</v>

834
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:40.934
<v Speaker 2>he's hired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a statistic I didn't even </v>

835
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 2>know until he got this a honorary Oscar </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

836
00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:50.740
<v Speaker 2>He's hired more African American actors </v>
<v Speaker 2>than any studio bar none.</v>

837
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:55.110
<v Speaker 2>So here's one guy who has not had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

838
00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.043
<v Speaker 2>a slew of blockbuster movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet he has made it a point to hire </v>

839
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:04.010
<v Speaker 2>more African American actors and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted that award with Sam Jackson and</v>

840
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Denzel Washington or top actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

841
00:43:06.321 --> 00:43:06.831
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>green.</v>

842
00:43:06.831 --> 00:43:07.664
<v Speaker 2>No matter what or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were there because they have </v>

843
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.980
<v Speaker 2>been in so many of his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

844
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.700
<v Speaker 2>it just hit me as we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

845
00:43:13.701 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 2>that it's so sad that so much has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>framed within,</v>

846
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:18.703
<v Speaker 2>within the racial lens because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't gotten it there because I've </v>

847
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:21.914
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey harry on my show who was the first </v>

848
00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:25.790
<v Speaker 2>black woman to ever win an emmy.</v>

849
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:26.923
<v Speaker 2>And I remember watching when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was probably 10 or 12 and I remember </v>

850
00:43:31.761 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 2>thinking this woman is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>hysterical.</v>

851
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look at her and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

852
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:37.934
<v Speaker 2>there's a black woman making me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought this woman is hysterical </v>

853
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.020
<v Speaker 2>and I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

854
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 2>talent ultimately is what has to reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top,</v>

855
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.950
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>systemic things can't be.</v>

856
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.180
<v Speaker 2>And that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where people were not talking per</v>

857
00:43:53.181 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 2>se about affirmative action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people I think get that wrong.</v>

858
00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.110
<v Speaker 2>We're not asking that you lower the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standards.</v>

859
00:44:00.111 --> 00:44:02.300
<v Speaker 2>We're asking that you even the playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

860
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:04.940
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say to the people,</v>

861
00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this bubble up a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>lately,</v>

862
00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:07.790
<v Speaker 2>that people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

863
00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:10.030
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the Latino community </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

864
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.120
<v Speaker 2>there are numbers in America versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>their nominations or the Asian community</v>

865
00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:15.210
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

866
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.360
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never get nominated basically.</v>

867
00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 2>So I see a lot of people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

868
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 2>the black community is fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong fight here.</v>

869
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.630
<v Speaker 2>They're fighting something that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else go.</v>

870
00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:24.693
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting about Oscars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cares about Oscars while the </v>

871
00:44:27.321 --> 00:44:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Latino community is way less represented</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

872
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.690
<v Speaker 2>That is a fantastic</v>

873
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:35.210
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I knew I'd get one right.</v>

874
00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Look at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do black people do?</v>

875
00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:42.290
<v Speaker 2>We break the damn doors down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody else,</v>

876
00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.090
<v Speaker 2>the gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Latinos,</v>

877
00:44:44.091 --> 00:44:47.360
<v Speaker 2>the Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women can walk through the door.</v>

878
00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.530
<v Speaker 2>So watch what happens when diversity </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens is,</v>

879
00:44:51.531 --> 00:44:55.340
<v Speaker 2>and I got to just be about black actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be about diverse actors.</v>

880
00:44:55.341 --> 00:44:57.410
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians,</v>

881
00:44:57.411 --> 00:45:00.710
<v Speaker 2>people with disabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will all benefit.</v>

882
00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Somebody has to lead on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look historically,</v>

883
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.470
<v Speaker 2>it's been African Americans who've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing,</v>

884
00:45:06.471 --> 00:45:07.304
<v Speaker 2>even though you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately our numbers are much </v>

885
00:45:09.111 --> 00:45:09.944
<v Speaker 2>smaller than Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have a much more organized and </v>

886
00:45:14.181 --> 00:45:15.014
<v Speaker 2>developed a system of protesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>raising issues of racial inequality in </v>

887
00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:24.710
<v Speaker 2>this country than Latinos and Asians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Trust me,</v>

888
00:45:24.711 --> 00:45:26.870
<v Speaker 2>when we break the doors down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody else is saying,</v>

889
00:45:26.871 --> 00:45:28.750
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they broke that damn door down.</v>

890
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll watch that door is too broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch everybody run through that door.</v>

891
00:45:34.641 --> 00:45:38.000
<v Speaker 2>So I would say to Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asians stand up with us.</v>

892
00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.253
<v Speaker 2>We all benefit from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not saying that it's all black </v>

893
00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:42.381
<v Speaker 2>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want us,</v>

894
00:45:42.381 --> 00:45:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see more females.</v>

895
00:45:44.631 --> 00:45:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to see I'm a disability rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocate.</v>

896
00:45:47.421 --> 00:45:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I want to see more individuals with </v>
<v Speaker 2>disabilities portrayed in movies.</v>

897
00:45:51.921 --> 00:45:52.754
<v Speaker 2>And television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think nothing but good from any </v>

898
00:45:55.581 --> 00:46:00.581
<v Speaker 2>marginalized group comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts of what we see happening on this</v>

899
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Oscar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So white.</v>

900
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way it shows the strength of the </v>

901
00:46:03.211 --> 00:46:04.044
<v Speaker 1>black community actually because because</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what we care about culturally </v>

902
00:46:08.131 --> 00:46:08.964
<v Speaker 1>and the music we listened to and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff comes from the black </v>

903
00:46:12.781 --> 00:46:13.614
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like in a way that the black </v>

904
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:18.110
<v Speaker 1>community has the lead on this for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other minorities.</v>

905
00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:19.020
<v Speaker 1>So it does kind of make sense.</v>

906
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.150
<v Speaker 2>And for those folks that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

907
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:22.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a bunch of millionaires fighting</v>

908
00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:24.660
<v Speaker 2>about a gold statue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

909
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.033
<v Speaker 2>The Oscars are a very important </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution and the entertainment </v>

910
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:31.074
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in a state like California </v>

911
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.290
<v Speaker 2>is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

912
00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:37.140
<v Speaker 2>if we're buying 46 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tickets at the box office,</v>

913
00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 2>this is an issue that we need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of.</v>

914
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Does it mean that we don't care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunger?</v>

915
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:43.104
<v Speaker 2>Does it mean that we don't care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty and the poverty and the fact </v>

916
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:46.794
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

917
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.060
<v Speaker 2>one out of three black kids live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>

918
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:50.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what our capacity is large enough </v>

919
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:59.330
<v Speaker 2>that we can fight the fight on poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as address issues at the Oscars.</v>

920
00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't see them as mutually exclusive</v>

921
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:02.350
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

922
00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:02.881
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's,</v>

923
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:05.370
<v Speaker 1>let's go with the poverty thing for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit because,</v>

924
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:06.263
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've seen lately </v>

925
00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:08.484
<v Speaker 1>is that a lot of numbers are showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the black community has not gotten </v>

926
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:17.040
<v Speaker 1>any better economically under the seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of Obama.</v>

927
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:18.750
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people felt,</v>

928
00:47:18.751 --> 00:47:19.584
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to sort of be a post racial </v>

929
00:47:20.551 --> 00:47:22.710
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've quite got there.</v>

930
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

931
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.590
<v Speaker 1>but what can the black community do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get those numbers?</v>

932
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:29.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't necessarily agree with those </v>

933
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 2>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're there.</v>

934
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on what you read,</v>

935
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.960
<v Speaker 2>the economy overall is much better under</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

936
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Millions more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

937
00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 2>the economy itself at the economy itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

938
00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:47.821
<v Speaker 2>but that the black community still </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind in that sort of regroup the black</v>

939
00:47:48.281 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 2>community has made some gains under </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

940
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:53.110
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with and,</v>

941
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:53.944
<v Speaker 2>and I reject those statistics that say </v>
<v Speaker 2>blacks are worse off under Obama than </v>

942
00:47:56.981 --> 00:48:00.450
<v Speaker 2>they were under George Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

943
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

944
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.380
<v Speaker 2>do we still have a ways to go in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>

945
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.273
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we still a disproportionately </v>

946
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 2>impacted by a criminal justice system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

947
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Are we still lagging behind in wages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a in asset accumulation?</v>

948
00:48:17.711 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is a lot of work to be done,</v>

949
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:21.034
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't dismiss the great work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that President Obama has done on </v>

950
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A look at the jobs,</v>

951
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 2>the unemployment rate lower than it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been in a decade.</v>

952
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.751
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

953
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to celebrate those pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

954
00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:34.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

955
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:35.783
<v Speaker 2>the advances that have been made and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep fighting and just overcoming </v>

956
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of years of systemic racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously what we are now seeing doesn't</v>

957
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:47.284
<v Speaker 2>happen overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a long and entrenched fight that </v>

958
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.570
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

959
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 2>what we learned more attractable than </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps what we thought.</v>

960
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone thought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama's legacy,</v>

961
00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hope we were all high on hope.</v>

962
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:04.603
<v Speaker 2>Here's a were on hold and no one could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have predicted that the rancor and the </v>

963
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:16.480
<v Speaker 2>adversarial nature of what he has faced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in these last three years.</v>

964
00:49:16.481 --> 00:49:17.171
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

965
00:49:17.171 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine that and saw that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say.</v>

966
00:49:20.471 --> 00:49:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that racial,</v>

967
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.750
<v Speaker 2>is that that our system is just warped </v>
<v Speaker 2>wood.</v>

968
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Would the Republicans have been more </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to work with a white president?</v>

969
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I hate bringing everything down to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To that point.</v>

970
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.310
<v Speaker 2>There may be some element of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

971
00:49:33.311 --> 00:49:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we know.</v>

972
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we can ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

973
00:49:38.591 --> 00:49:39.424
<v Speaker 2>I get so beat up about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just what I know just </v>

974
00:49:41.801 --> 00:49:42.700
<v Speaker 2>historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

975
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:43.534
<v Speaker 2>I'm a student of history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A race matters in this country and no </v>

976
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 2>matter whether you're the president of </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States or you're the president of</v>

977
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Speaker 2>the Oscars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're still fighting these</v>

978
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:56.570
<v Speaker 2>battles have to tell us that race still </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>

979
00:49:56.571 --> 00:49:57.930
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

980
00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.410
<v Speaker 2>well let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about we get away from Raytheon?</v>

981
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:02.643
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a shame that we have to spend </v>

982
00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:05.780
<v Speaker 2>so much time talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

983
00:50:05.781 --> 00:50:07.210
<v Speaker 2>that is the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>

984
00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.273
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk about politics because </v>

985
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:12.310
<v Speaker 2>politics thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are supporting Hillary.</v>

986
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:13.623
<v Speaker 2>I am supporting Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also supporting a slew of </v>

987
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.490
<v Speaker 2>progressive and some female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly female candidates.</v>

988
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big proponent of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of inclusion,</v>

989
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:25.750
<v Speaker 2>not just for race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for women,</v>

990
00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 2>for lgbt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Latino's.</v>

991
00:50:28.131 --> 00:50:31.160
<v Speaker 2>I just think this country works better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our state,</v>

992
00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.210
<v Speaker 2>our city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our county,</v>

993
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.343
<v Speaker 2>when we have diverse voices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I support a lot of candidates at the </v>

994
00:50:36.621 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 2>local,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state and national level that don't look</v>

995
00:50:41.031 --> 00:50:42.090
<v Speaker 2>like traditional candidate.</v>

996
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of the Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign?</v>

997
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:45.344
<v Speaker 1>Because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure who I'm supporting at this </v>

998
00:50:47.241 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really still,</v>

999
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:49.154
<v Speaker 1>I've become a really at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see myself as a real centrist and I'm </v>

1000
00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:53.414
<v Speaker 1>just not sure now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that Hillary and Bernie </v>

1001
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.440
<v Speaker 1>are way better than any Republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates,</v>

1002
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been about substance,</v>

1003
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've really,</v>

1004
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 1>even with the gun thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1005
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Hillary's trying to pin Bernie as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun guy.</v>

1006
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile he got a d minus from the NRA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so it's really been about substance.</v>

1007
00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 1>The Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trunk,</v>

1008
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.140
<v Speaker 1>it's silliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about that too.</v>

1009
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I have seen with Hillary's</v>

1010
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:19.190
<v Speaker 1>that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this campaign,</v>

1011
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.590
<v Speaker 1>because of the email stuff and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

1012
00:51:22.591 --> 00:51:23.660
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which finally that's going away,</v>

1013
00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is no,</v>

1014
00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:28.040
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been a point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been like a run,</v>

1015
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:28.903
<v Speaker 1>like a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like month long run where this is about </v>

1016
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:34.130
<v Speaker 1>really feeling good and maybe that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media doesn't like her.</v>

1017
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the media really likes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1018
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:38.720
<v Speaker 1>But how do you feel about the campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>in general?</v>

1019
00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:39.603
<v Speaker 2>So here's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the trump and the outsider </v>

1020
00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.373
<v Speaker 2>voices that have dominated the news </v>
<v Speaker 2>media isn't just impacting glp and the </v>

1021
00:51:49.271 --> 00:51:50.104
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also impacting dims as well in </v>

1022
00:51:53.051 --> 00:51:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Bernie is lining up as that outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice,</v>

1023
00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:00.010
<v Speaker 2>and Hillary of course is the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment candidate.</v>

1024
00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.430
<v Speaker 2>When you listen to what Bernie and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary are saying,</v>

1025
00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.480
<v Speaker 2>knowing what we now know about Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie's policies,</v>

1026
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:11.350
<v Speaker 2>they just don't have a snowball's chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>in hell of ever coming to fruition.</v>

1027
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.590
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about a 90 percent tax rate</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the rich.</v>

1028
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.313
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich guys in Congress as Senate are </v>

1029
00:52:18.641 --> 00:52:19.474
<v Speaker 1>going to vote for 90 percent tax rate on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that snow jumping because I know people </v>

1030
00:52:22.451 --> 00:52:23.284
<v Speaker 1>are going to be yelling at you over that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've mentioned that and people </v>

1031
00:52:24.761 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 1>have said to me what he's saying is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be a progressive tax,</v>

1032
00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:28.894
<v Speaker 1>so it's not that you're being taxed </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully on the 90 percent increase on the </v>

1033
00:52:33.371 --> 00:52:35.440
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't play well to Congress</v>

1034
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.720
<v Speaker 2>because most of those guys are rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1035
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:43.680
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about eliminating obamacare</v>
<v Speaker 2>as single source,</v>

1036
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:45.303
<v Speaker 2>single payer source healthcare system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't get that voted in even when </v>

1037
00:52:49.121 --> 00:52:53.680
<v Speaker 2>the congress was controlled by Dims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I like his fire.</v>

1038
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I like his progressive politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a pragmatist at heart and I just</v>

1039
00:52:58.571 --> 00:53:03.571
<v Speaker 2>don't think any of those things he could</v>
<v Speaker 2>get accomplished and we don't need eight</v>

1040
00:53:03.761 --> 00:53:07.180
<v Speaker 2>more years of not being able to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything accomplished.</v>

1041
00:53:07.181 --> 00:53:10.450
<v Speaker 2>What I like about Hillary is she setting</v>
<v Speaker 2>me on fire.</v>

1042
00:53:10.451 --> 00:53:15.451
<v Speaker 2>Am I as high as I was eight years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I don't have any of that,</v>

1043
00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:20.770
<v Speaker 2>but at the core of me I like getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff done.</v>

1044
00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.693
<v Speaker 2>I think the woman can get shit done and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk about the in Gaza and the </v>

1045
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:27.270
<v Speaker 2>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

1046
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.360
<v Speaker 2>the crowning joy of her campaign was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting at those hearings for a moment.</v>

1047
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:37.043
<v Speaker 2>The way they attacked her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have taken Mother Teresa </v>

1048
00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:41.694
<v Speaker 2>herself to too restrain some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>junior just got to Congress five days </v>

1049
00:53:50.021 --> 00:53:52.420
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know where the bathroom is.</v>

1050
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.553
<v Speaker 2>People yelling at her about the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous and unimportant details and </v>

1051
00:53:58.991 --> 00:54:01.780
<v Speaker 2>she just sat there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I so I'm with you 100 percent.</v>

1052
00:54:01.781 --> 00:54:04.040
<v Speaker 2>That that was not only was her best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me was like,</v>

1053
00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you should be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for that.</v>

1054
00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I posted a really funny line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see there was a moment where she</v>

1055
00:54:08.861 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 2>did this little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

1056
00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:15.100
<v Speaker 2>it was like drop the mic and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>

1057
00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.473
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of level headed </v>
<v Speaker 2>toughness that you need an office and </v>

1058
00:54:21.251 --> 00:54:22.330
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1059
00:54:22.331 --> 00:54:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Bernie is doing all that,</v>

1060
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:24.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1061
00:54:24.221 --> 00:54:25.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to bring it down a notch.</v>

1062
00:54:25.811 --> 00:54:27.730
<v Speaker 2>You yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really understand you.</v>

1063
00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:29.260
<v Speaker 2>You're making it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're giving me a headache.</v>

1064
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting because I know so a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of my audience loves Bernie and I've</v>

1065
00:54:34.221 --> 00:54:37.550
<v Speaker 1>said several times that me and my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Bernie the best.</v>

1066
00:54:37.551 --> 00:54:39.890
<v Speaker 1>I liked the ideas the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also,</v>

1067
00:54:39.891 --> 00:54:43.520
<v Speaker 1>because I consider myself a pragmatist </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he saying these things,</v>

1068
00:54:43.521 --> 00:54:46.670
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I see what he tweets these </v>
<v Speaker 1>really lofty things about,</v>

1069
00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about changing the system.</v>

1070
00:54:48.021 --> 00:54:48.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for changing the system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting money out of politics and all </v>

1071
00:54:50.271 --> 00:54:51.104
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we just had Obama tried to change </v>

1072
00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:57.791
<v Speaker 1>the system pretty intensely too and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were all higher than seven years ago.</v>

1073
00:54:58.521 --> 00:54:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1074
00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.710
<v Speaker 1>that's why at this point I sort of think</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mostly begrudgingly</v>

1075
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.890
<v Speaker 2>supporting hillary too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because here's the problem with that,</v>

1076
00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:10.050
<v Speaker 2>and I tried to tell people this with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

1077
00:55:10.051 --> 00:55:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he says to me that that's okay,</v>

1078
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:14.064
<v Speaker 2>that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why my clients pay me a thousand </v>

1079
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:17.280
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1080
00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:22.540
<v Speaker 2>we have a two party system and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president is here.</v>

1081
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.273
<v Speaker 2>He can do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can do nothing without the congress </v>

1082
00:55:27.251 --> 00:55:29.260
<v Speaker 2>and the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be the most Charisse,</v>

1083
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.080
<v Speaker 2>you cannot bend more charismatic than </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

1084
00:55:32.081 --> 00:55:32.914
<v Speaker 2>The guy is like swag on steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean anything in </v>

1085
00:55:36.881 --> 00:55:37.714
<v Speaker 2>Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem with all these </v>

1086
00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.210
<v Speaker 2>people following trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is not going to be a dictator.</v>

1087
00:55:43.211 --> 00:55:46.120
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a dictatorship in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1088
00:55:46.121 --> 00:55:46.954
<v Speaker 2>Our government is about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a collaborative and if you're not </v>

1089
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:54.880
<v Speaker 2>able one to understand that and then to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to navigate that,</v>

1090
00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:56.740
<v Speaker 2>you get nothing done.</v>

1091
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.593
<v Speaker 1>So that's the crazy part and where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to in this I think is probably a </v>

1092
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:00.763
<v Speaker 1>throughline of everything we've said </v>
<v Speaker 1>here is that education is the most </v>

1093
00:56:03.481 --> 00:56:04.620
<v Speaker 1>important part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have.</v>

1094
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.023
<v Speaker 1>We have three branches of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People forget that we have a judicial </v>

1095
00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:10.350
<v Speaker 1>branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decide what's legal.</v>

1096
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:11.243
<v Speaker 1>We have a legislative branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decide to make laws and then we </v>

1097
00:56:14.311 --> 00:56:16.240
<v Speaker 1>have all these policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1098
00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:16.890
<v Speaker 1>these</v>

1099
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:17.723
<v Speaker 2>glp candidates are talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna build a wall and they're </v>

1100
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>going to hell how exactly you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

1101
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:27.020
<v Speaker 1>So that to me is the most dangerous part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this for a second,</v>

1102
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.720
<v Speaker 1>because I saw him say a week ago or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago,</v>

1103
00:56:29.721 --> 00:56:31.730
<v Speaker 1>he said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm president,</v>

1104
00:56:31.731 --> 00:56:32.564
<v Speaker 1>you know they're going to put a merry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas back on starbucks card or </v>

1105
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:36.800
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I get it.</v>

1106
00:56:36.801 --> 00:56:37.634
<v Speaker 1>It's just a stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just throwing stupid red meat out </v>

1107
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:42.830
<v Speaker 1>to some morons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like even that it shows,</v>

1108
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:43.723
<v Speaker 1>it shows a inclination to not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand what the role of the </v>

1109
00:56:49.461 --> 00:56:50.540
<v Speaker 1>president is</v>

1110
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.630
<v Speaker 2>dummied down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch those gop debates,</v>

1111
00:56:53.631 --> 00:56:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're foreign.</v>

1112
00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:58.460
<v Speaker 2>When Ben Carson said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see my mother,</v>

1113
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.570
<v Speaker 2>she used to drive a car until the car </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't drive anymore.</v>

1114
00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Then she would take her pennies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd buy a new car.</v>

1115
00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is supposed to translate to economic </v>

1116
00:57:11.211 --> 00:57:16.211
<v Speaker 2>policy of the world hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her pennies do well on ice as well.</v>

1117
00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.253
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you one of the questions like when </v>

1118
00:57:22.331 --> 00:57:23.930
<v Speaker 2>you can't bomb these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1119
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.540
<v Speaker 2>these vehicles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have civilians.</v>

1120
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Well just tell them if they ride in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

1121
00:57:29.511 --> 00:57:31.590
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get bombed so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't get in the car.</v>

1122
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the piece.</v>

1123
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:57:36.601 --> 00:57:37.434
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

1125
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 2>that's not a policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Isis is stupidity.</v>

1126
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's the piece that goes across </v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides because.</v>

1127
00:57:44.521 --> 00:57:46.500
<v Speaker 1>So you hear that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear Ben Carson?</v>

1128
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you clearly know nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about foreign policy.</v>

1129
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Like he just uses a couple of buzzwords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caliphate Jihad.</v>

1130
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:53.663
<v Speaker 1>He just puts a couple words together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I'll hear Bernie talk about it </v>

1131
00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:57.563
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly not for nation building </v>

1132
00:57:59.941 --> 00:58:01.500
<v Speaker 1>and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I hear him say,</v>

1133
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:02.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1134
00:58:02.761 --> 00:58:05.010
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have to work with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>allies,</v>

1135
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:05.610
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1136
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:07.890
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also will say I'm never for war,</v>

1137
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.410
<v Speaker 1>which means that there's no threat of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything too.</v>

1138
00:58:10.411 --> 00:58:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's like both sides are playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1139
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.323
<v Speaker 2>That's the scary part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I think the worst thing </v>

1140
00:58:16.511 --> 00:58:17.344
<v Speaker 2>about the trump reality show is it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>dummied down the conversation so that </v>

1141
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:25.670
<v Speaker 2>we're starting to believe that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>bluster is,</v>

1142
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:26.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blow horns can go in with these </v>

1143
00:58:28.901 --> 00:58:33.180
<v Speaker 2>simplistic solutions to these complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

1144
00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:37.570
<v Speaker 2>the problems are so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his whole Muslim policy,</v>

1145
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.670
<v Speaker 2>do you know that the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting isis the most are Muslims?</v>

1146
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:47.850
<v Speaker 2>So when you insult for Muslim community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you insulting our outside.</v>

1147
00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>

1148
00:58:50.741 --> 00:58:51.574
<v Speaker 2>you don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now what's really scary me as </v>

1149
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:58.030
<v Speaker 2>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when trump becomes the gop nominee,</v>

1150
00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:02.290
<v Speaker 2>he's got an now somehow figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to reverse himself.</v>

1151
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's insulted African Americans,</v>

1152
00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:05.074
<v Speaker 2>Latinos and Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just about every group that you need to </v>

1153
00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:09.640
<v Speaker 2>win the general election in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1154
00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:13.120
<v Speaker 2>So now he's got to walk that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how do you walk that back?</v>

1155
00:59:13.121 --> 00:59:15.670
<v Speaker 2>And here's his dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he walks it back,</v>

1156
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:21.330
<v Speaker 2>those white lower middle class men </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly who were supporting him,</v>

1157
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:23.114
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be passed because the </v>

1158
00:59:24.081 --> 00:59:27.590
<v Speaker 2>reason they like him is because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up to make America great.</v>

1159
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.513
<v Speaker 2>I eat white again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you embrace the immigrant </v>

1160
00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 2>population in the Muslim population </v>
<v Speaker 2>without alienating your base?</v>

1161
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's the stupidity of the GOP </v>
<v Speaker 2>party did me?</v>

1162
00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:39.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1163
00:59:39.841 --> 00:59:41.670
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where I've been very critical of</v>

1164
00:59:41.671 --> 00:59:45.270
<v Speaker 1>the left because I think that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive's because they.</v>

1165
00:59:45.271 --> 00:59:48.060
<v Speaker 1>So their intentions usually are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

1166
00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:53.280
<v Speaker 1>but they're so their knee jerk responses</v>
<v Speaker 1>to yell bigot or racist or homophobic or</v>

1167
00:59:53.281 --> 00:59:55.920
<v Speaker 1>sexist or whatever it is at everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they.</v>

1168
00:59:55.921 --> 00:59:56.754
<v Speaker 1>In a way they've enabled trump because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've silenced so many centrists and </v>

1169
01:00:00.861 --> 01:00:01.694
<v Speaker 1>so many liberals that I think they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled will then trump just comes in </v>

1170
01:00:04.411 --> 01:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>with answers instead of saying instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a real debate where we say,</v>

1171
01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>what are we really doing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration right now?</v>

1172
01:00:10.081 --> 01:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>What are we really doing about refugees </v>
<v Speaker 1>and migrants?</v>

1173
01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Trump just comes in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1174
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm banning everybody and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds good.</v>

1175
01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>So I partly do blame our side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aisle on that because we haven't,</v>

1176
01:00:20.881 --> 01:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>we haven't dealt with it well,</v>

1177
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.080
<v Speaker 2>a narrow group of people that he plays </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1178
01:00:25.081 --> 01:00:25.914
<v Speaker 2>But I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I find most </v>

1179
01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:31.611
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the glp election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember after Mitt Romney lost,</v>

1180
01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:37.350
<v Speaker 2>they went and did this exhaustive audit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did we lose?</v>

1181
01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.213
<v Speaker 2>So let's dissect it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's analyze and figure out what </v>

1182
01:00:40.361 --> 01:00:44.380
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they concluded was they did not</v>

1183
01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Garner enough votes from the minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>voters,</v>

1184
01:00:48.281 --> 01:00:51.790
<v Speaker 2>particularly Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they had to become the party of</v>

1185
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.400
<v Speaker 2>inclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1186
01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.293
<v Speaker 2>and in all their big money donors said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're no longer supporting any of these </v>

1187
01:00:58.691 --> 01:01:01.900
<v Speaker 2>kooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want candidates that can win.</v>

1188
01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:02.763
<v Speaker 2>We're going to put our money behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates that can win and we're going </v>

1189
01:01:04.391 --> 01:01:05.224
<v Speaker 2>to go out and become the party of one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've done the exact opposite </v>

1190
01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:16.130
<v Speaker 2>front runners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not runner runners have made the concept</v>

1191
01:01:17.191 --> 01:01:19.020
<v Speaker 2>of inclusion like a joke.</v>

1192
01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's clearly why trump is.</v>

1193
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>The party is against trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1194
01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:23.943
<v Speaker 1>So one last thing before we wrap up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to talk a little bit about </v>

1195
01:01:26.861 --> 01:01:27.694
<v Speaker 1>your son and your activism in with </v>
<v Speaker 1>autism and the things that you've </v>

1196
01:01:31.211 --> 01:01:34.450
<v Speaker 1>written and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we hear a lot about autism,</v>

1197
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think people really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it is or how many people</v>

1198
01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>are now affected by autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only the,</v>

1199
01:01:41.801 --> 01:01:43.630
<v Speaker 1>the kids that have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1200
01:01:43.631 --> 01:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>but the families and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in just a couple minutes,</v>

1201
01:01:46.241 --> 01:01:47.740
<v Speaker 1>can we just do like a autism one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

1202
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.661
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quickly.</v>

1203
01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:53.661
<v Speaker 2>So autism is a neurological disorder </v>
<v Speaker 2>impacts three major areas.</v>

1204
01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Your communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to learn.</v>

1205
01:01:57.121 --> 01:01:59.520
<v Speaker 2>So your cognition and then your social </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills.</v>

1206
01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>One in 64 children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some say that number's understate.</v>

1207
01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.030
<v Speaker 2>It could be as high as one in 34,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one and 35,</v>

1208
01:02:06.031 --> 01:02:06.864
<v Speaker 2>but the CDC number is one in 64 children</v>
<v Speaker 2>have autism boys four times more likely </v>

1209
01:02:12.241 --> 01:02:13.074
<v Speaker 2>than girls to have autism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it impacts the fastest growing </v>

1210
01:02:16.861 --> 01:02:17.694
<v Speaker 2>childhood disorder in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not possible for you to not </v>

1211
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 2>have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coworker,</v>

1212
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:27.080
<v Speaker 2>a family member of someone in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle that's been impacted by autism.</v>

1213
01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 2>My best friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So spectrum disorder.</v>

1214
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:31.380
<v Speaker 2>So that means you meet one person with </v>
<v Speaker 2>autism,</v>

1215
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 2>you've met one person with autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because every child,</v>

1216
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:39.780
<v Speaker 2>every adult is impacted differently from</v>
<v Speaker 2>some very high functioning folks who you</v>

1217
01:02:39.781 --> 01:02:42.000
<v Speaker 2>might've heard the term asperger's </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

1218
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:42.923
<v Speaker 2>a false side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Gates allegedly have asperger's </v>

1219
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:48.450
<v Speaker 2>disorder to people who are so low </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning that term low functioning,</v>

1220
01:02:48.451 --> 01:02:53.451
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean it in a pejorative way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who have no verbal skills have to be</v>

1221
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:57.510
<v Speaker 2>in some kind of group home or very </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictive environment.</v>

1222
01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:02.190
<v Speaker 2>A huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge push was made in the last decade to</v>

1223
01:03:02.191 --> 01:03:06.150
<v Speaker 2>address issues of adequate diagnosis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention.</v>

1224
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistically African Americans,</v>

1225
01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Latinos diagnosed two to four years </v>
<v Speaker 2>later than their typical peers.</v>

1226
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Really difficult time accessing </v>
<v Speaker 2>services.</v>

1227
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Now the focus and the push is on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aging out.</v>

1228
01:03:20.191 --> 01:03:23.010
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the kids that were diagnosed</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago,</v>

1229
01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:26.010
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are becoming teens and young adults.</v>

1230
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:30.510
<v Speaker 2>So the question of college employment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and independent living.</v>

1231
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:31.523
<v Speaker 2>So there's been kind of a shift in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community or there's this slowly the </v>

1232
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:35.703
<v Speaker 2>shift is happening to focus on what do </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do with this population of teens and </v>

1233
01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:41.910
<v Speaker 2>young adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if people want to find out more,</v>

1234
01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:45.420
<v Speaker 2>where can we find out quick about my </v>
<v Speaker 2>work?</v>

1235
01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:46.201
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1240
01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:55.283

<v Speaker 2>I mean I literally didn't pick up my </v>

1241
01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 2>notes so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a good conversation.</v>

1242
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:02.363
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want to thank her eva Martin and </v>
