1
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:02.790
<v Speaker 1>We</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 2>spend a lot of time talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left around here,</v>

3
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 2>but this week we're going to be diving </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the right.</v>

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 2>My guest is conservative radio talk show</v>
<v Speaker 2>host,</v>

5
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.454
<v Speaker 2>lawyer and writer Larry Elder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry has written several books on </v>

6
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 2>conservative principles with a focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and racial issues.</v>

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 2>Much of his work is very similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually to the ideas we talk about here</v>

8
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 2>on the Rubin report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including religion,</v>

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 2>the role of government and personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.793
<v Speaker 2>According to his biography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry uses facts and common sense to </v>

11
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 2>arrive at his conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds familiar right now.</v>

12
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 2>If I use those same precepts as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 2>can we both be right at the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can both be wrong?</v>

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Is the answer somewhere in the middle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

15
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what we're going to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to find out.</v>

16
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.643
<v Speaker 2>As I discussed with Don Lemon last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media talks so much about the left </v>

17
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.424
<v Speaker 2>right divide in this country that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to forget that there are decent </v>

18
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 2>people on both sides of the debate.</v>

19
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the reasons I've taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left to task so much on this show.</v>

20
00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.753
<v Speaker 2>The further off the deep end they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less we'll be able to find </v>

21
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:02.964
<v Speaker 2>compromise with people we disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because I may have different views </v>

22
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 2>on abortion than Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean that they hate all women.</v>

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.573
<v Speaker 2>Just because I may have different views </v>
<v Speaker 2>than Republicans on guns doesn't mean </v>

24
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:14.994
<v Speaker 2>that there are a bunch of rednecks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because Republicans aren't for </v>

25
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 2>legalizing marijuana doesn't mean they </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't fun to hang out with.</v>

26
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that one might be true,</v>

27
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.294
<v Speaker 2>but I think you see my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the best way to start a </v>

28
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 2>conversation about political ideology is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually define the terms.</v>

29
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.713
<v Speaker 2>This is something I've done with a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests so far because I often think </v>

30
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 2>we're all talking about different things</v>
<v Speaker 2>while using the same words.</v>

31
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.003
<v Speaker 2>Fear not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have Google and according to the </v>

32
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Oxford Dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the definition of conservatism.</v>

33
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Conservatism is the holding of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative principles.</v>

34
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 2>The tendency to resist great or sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

35
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:50.634
<v Speaker 2>especially in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adherence to traditional values and </v>

36
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 2>ideas sometimes opposed to liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

37
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 2>so I think we have a nice jumping off </v>
<v Speaker 2>point there.</v>

38
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.743
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives aren't big on change and </v>

39
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 2>when they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to go about it slowly.</v>

40
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I think this concept has been conflated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the concept of right wing politics,</v>

41
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.883
<v Speaker 2>so I even googled that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to the concise Oxford </v>

42
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Dictionary of politics in liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracies,</v>

43
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 2>the political right opposes socialism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and social democracy,</v>

44
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 2>right wing parties include </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives,</v>

45
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Christian Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classic liberals,</v>

46
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 2>nationalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the far right racists and fascist.</v>

47
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 2>You can see how these two concepts have </v>
<v Speaker 2>morphed into the Republican Party.</v>

48
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 2>In America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an ideology that doesn't want to</v>

49
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:36.894
<v Speaker 2>change the system to quickly coupled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a political affiliation that is </v>

50
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 2>focused on economics and some level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral authority.</v>

51
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.293
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberals are also included in </v>

52
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 2>that group and the more and more I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been talking about this stuff,</v>

53
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 2>the more I've been considering myself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that category.</v>

54
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to touch on that more in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next couple of weeks.</v>

55
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Now that we've laid out some basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms,</v>

56
00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:58.674
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a solid jumping off </v>
<v Speaker 2>point to discuss all the issues of the </v>

57
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 2>day from abortion to economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to foreign policy to guns.</v>

58
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Can we find out where we agree instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of just yelling over each other?</v>

59
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.993
<v Speaker 2>I think we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only way is to be brave enough </v>

60
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 2>to talk to those we don't actually agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

61
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 2>If we refuse to talk to those that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't see eye to eye with,</v>

62
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 2>we'll just end up taking an eye for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye.</v>

63
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a writer,</v>

64
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>and host of the aptly named Larry Elder </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio show.</v>

65
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has it gone on a great day.</v>

66
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

67
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for coming in.</v>

68
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to make this happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you for awhile.</v>

69
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Dodge darts and you forever caught up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

70
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotcha.</v>

71
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been in this studio before.</v>

72
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:41.580
<v Speaker 2>I have a guest hosted for Larry a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

73
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Larry King or a king that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a Larry Man.</v>

74
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 2>He has a thing and it's kind of for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>full hour.</v>

75
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can.</v>

76
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>He can only have people with the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry,</v>

77
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I guess those words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that worked out for you.</v>

78
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.520
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of stuff I want to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and in,</v>

79
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.363
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning of the show I set up </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I am a liberal or conservative </v>

80
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 2>condolence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This time this show is over,</v>

81
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:01.654
<v Speaker 2>we can move you to the center a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit and maybe by the time the show's </v>

82
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.420
<v Speaker 2>over weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna that's not at that,</v>

83
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it's all about.</v>

84
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.773
<v Speaker 2>That's why I've wanted to have you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show because I find there are some </v>

85
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 2>people in the public space that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with,</v>

86
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:13.864
<v Speaker 2>but that I'd like to sit down and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about some of the ideas and I consider </v>

87
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case.</v>

88
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we get to the politics,</v>

89
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.783
<v Speaker 2>I liked the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know a little bit about the history of </v>

90
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>the people I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you just,</v>

91
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I know you were born in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a little larry elder history.</v>

92
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Born and raised in La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was a janitor.</v>

93
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 2>He cleaned toilets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>dude who's in his life the longest.</v>

99
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.113
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father was kicked out of his house </v>

100
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 2>and was 13 years old by his </v>
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible grandmother and was on his</v>

101
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 2>own from that point on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my mom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>my dad and my mom got together and moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>to California in the forties.</v>

107
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I have two brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

108
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:03.970

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Negative.</v>

117
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it for two and a half,</v>

118
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.144
<v Speaker 2>three years and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find a lot of people in the public </v>

119
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.044
<v Speaker 2>space either were lawyers at one time or</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a ton of comedians that </v>

120
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 2>were lawyers.</v>

121
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 2>What is it about lawyers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them want to get out.</v>

122
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 2>What's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's true.</v>

123
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just a real flexible thing to do.</v>

124
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 2>You learn how to reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You learn about the law.</v>

125
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 2>You learned about the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a trial lawyer,</v>

126
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to think on your feet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it lends itself to doing other things.</v>

127
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 2>But most people I know who went to law </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

128
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>at least the ones I went to law school </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a state and the law.</v>

129
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.553
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was that a perfect segue to get you </v>

130
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>to be someone that talks for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like instead of having to</v>

131
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 3>litigate it in the courtroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could litigate it on air and bounce </v>

132
00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 3>back and forth with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's right.</v>

133
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Although most lawyers are not trial </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers.</v>

134
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of the image of most lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that their Glib and fast.</v>

135
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 3>Most lawyers sit behind a desk and fill </v>
<v Speaker 3>out papers.</v>

136
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.333
<v Speaker 3>There are tax lawyers or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or constitutional lawyers or contract </v>

137
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 3>lawyers or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only about 10 percent of lawyers,</v>

138
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up going to becoming litigated.</v>

139
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 3>And even a smaller number of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually try cases.</v>

140
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

141
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 3>So now let's talk about conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>

142
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.114
<v Speaker 3>So I've mostly been calling out the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my show because I consider myself </v>

143
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:30.584
<v Speaker 3>part of the left and I've seen the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of really go off the deep end to </v>

144
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 3>the left and I haven't been happy about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

145
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 3>So I haven't talked that much about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

146
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 3>I've had a couple of people on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

147
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 3>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

148
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.853
<v Speaker 3>how would you define conservatism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think that even means at </v>

149
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 3>this point in America in 2016?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it considered?</v>

150
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind being called a conservative</v>

151
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.203
<v Speaker 3>maturity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't pretend to be a four letter </v>

152
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:52.574
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really call myself a libertarian </v>

153
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in article one,</v>

154
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.204
<v Speaker 3>section eight of the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which gives the federal government a </v>

155
00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 3>small number of things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave meant money.</v>

156
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put together an army.</v>

157
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm a deal with the border is a handful </v>
<v Speaker 3>of other things.</v>

158
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A welfare,</v>

159
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>health care,</v>

160
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 3>abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same sex marriage,</v>

161
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Dr Sisto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide,</v>

162
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 3>all the social issues that the supreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>court takes up in my view,</v>

163
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't take up in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

164
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 3>That should be done on a state by state </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis.</v>

165
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think most conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe as well.</v>

166
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 3>So I'm with you on a lot and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely have some libertarian beliefs</v>

167
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most people are libertarian.</v>

168
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 3>They just don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The founding fathers were Libertarians,</v>

169
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.853
<v Speaker 3>the founding fathers drafted a document </v>
<v Speaker 3>that said our rights come from a power </v>

170
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 3>other than individuals and government </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't give us our rights.</v>

171
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.194
<v Speaker 3>We give government our rights and power </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything else should be left to </v>

172
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:42.284
<v Speaker 3>the states and to individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how the constitution would </v>

173
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 3>start it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how the country was started.</v>

174
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's how most Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>really feel,</v>

175
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they really think about it.</v>

176
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the funny things to me and</v>

177
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 3>why I've defended somebody like rand </v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul,</v>

178
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.230
<v Speaker 3>who's a lot of people would say as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>

179
00:07:56.231 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be defending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's libertarian,</v>

180
00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:58.544
<v Speaker 3>but he's a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on issues such as a legalizing </v>

181
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 3>marijuana or gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a libertarian because you don't want the</v>

182
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 3>government in your bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't care about these issues.</v>

183
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.463
<v Speaker 3>And as a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want people to do what they want and </v>

184
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.644
<v Speaker 3>marry who they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's somewhere where a libertarian </v>

185
00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:17.030
<v Speaker 3>and the liberal can really sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>joined together,</v>

186
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

187
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:19.184
<v Speaker 3>However you have people like Bill Maher </v>
<v Speaker 3>running around calling himself a </v>

188
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 3>libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Maher is not a libertarian.</v>

189
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 3>He believes in higher taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believes in a minimum wage.</v>

190
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.033
<v Speaker 3>He supported a Ralph Nader for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for government who wants to take over </v>

191
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.970
<v Speaker 3>businesses and have government run them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

192
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.853
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of people use it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sexy kind of term and have no idea </v>

193
00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:38.151
<v Speaker 3>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

194
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 3>So that's the economic side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

195
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.470
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's liberal on the social stuff and in,</v>

196
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:45.700
<v Speaker 3>in a way as a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

197
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 3>you're actually pretty liberal on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concern on the social stuff.</v>

198
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that same sex marriage,</v>

199
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 3>doctor assisted suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these kinds of things,</v>

200
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 3>abortion should be done on a state by </v>
<v Speaker 3>state basis in California.</v>

201
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.783
<v Speaker 3>We had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

202
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.853
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities to vote for or against a </v>

203
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.853
<v Speaker 3>same sex marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a proposition 30 and another time when </v>

204
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 3>we voted on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called,</v>

205
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

206
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 3>issue eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure eight.</v>

207
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.483
<v Speaker 3>And in both cases I voted in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>same sex marriage in both cases I was </v>

208
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 3>overruled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem with the idea that the</v>

209
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:15.290
<v Speaker 3>majority of my fellow Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

210
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 3>or our fellow Californians did not agree</v>
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>

211
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:18.264
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that I then go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Supreme Court and cram it down their </v>

212
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 3>throats of the other states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

213
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:22.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then that's,</v>

214
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 3>that's the state's rights issue and sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

215
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.314
<v Speaker 3>So you would say that the Supreme Court </v>
<v Speaker 3>is legislating from the bench or </v>

216
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 3>something to that effect?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

217
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.843
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

218
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

219
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 3>so you're basically okay with what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

220
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 3>you just don't like how it had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

221
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So someone like Rand Paul,</v>

222
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it sounds like you have a lot.</v>

223
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.990
<v Speaker 3>Do we are supporting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

224
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

225
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

226
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.913
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like Rand Paul because of his </v>

227
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:45.834
<v Speaker 3>position on foreign affairs and defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of libertarians and I don't think </v>

228
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 3>being a libertarian leads you to being </v>
<v Speaker 3>an isolationist,</v>

229
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.723
<v Speaker 3>although most libertarians are for </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons that I think are kind of </v>

230
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 3>confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a rand Paul is one of those guys who</v>

231
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:00.444
<v Speaker 3>attacked George W Bush for the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we were justified in going </v>

232
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:04.014
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the reason for going there </v>

233
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:05.724
<v Speaker 3>were legitimate and I think a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals are hypocritical on this issue </v>

234
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talked about how you,</v>

235
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 3>you chastise people on the left for </v>
<v Speaker 3>being hypocrites.</v>

236
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:13.014
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you one big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The argument against the Iraq war is </v>

237
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 3>that George W dot Bush foolishly wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to impose our values on another,</v>

238
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another culture,</v>

239
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.713
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had no idea what the aftermath would be </v>

240
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:25.890
<v Speaker 3>if we get rid of this bad guy.</v>

241
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

242
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.133
<v Speaker 3>Obama comes into office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he joined with the British and the </v>

243
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 3>French in bombing Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting rid of Qaddafi.</v>

244
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.200
<v Speaker 3>Why W he threatened us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

245
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for humanitarian,</v>

246
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.493
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civil rights reasons read recently at a </v>

247
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 3>debate was asked about why she did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

248
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:42.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

249
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 3>so they can have free elections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where was the left?</v>

250
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with regard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Egypt.</v>

251
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 3>We get rid of Mubarak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a thug,</v>

252
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 3>but they're all thugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Muslim Brotherhood comes in there,</v>

253
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Obama backs them,</v>

254
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

255
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 3>and the country is worse than it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

256
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 3>And then a.now</v>
<v Speaker 3>backing the guy that took over after the</v>

257
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 3>genocide for reasons that escape me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama decided,</v>

258
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.520
<v Speaker 3>saw it had to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

259
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Why these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these countries did not threaten us.</v>

260
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 3>The way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

261
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 3>erected a Irak was a deal after the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after nine slash 11,</v>

262
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:12.474
<v Speaker 3>90 percent of the American people </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that we're going to get hit </v>

263
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

264
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.353
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guy was stealing from the oil </v>

265
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:17.820
<v Speaker 3>for food program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

266
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

267
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

268
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:21.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interfering with our patrolling the </v>

269
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 3>southern didn't no fly zones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

270
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.290
<v Speaker 3>he had used chemical weapons on his own </v>
<v Speaker 3>people we know that because it used them</v>

271
00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 3>on the Iranians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used them on the Kurds.</v>

272
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.143
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tried to assassinate George Herbert </v>

273
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Walker Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

274
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.340
<v Speaker 3>he was a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

275
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.313
<v Speaker 3>and like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least we had a legitimate reason for </v>

276
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 3>going there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got the backing of both the house</v>

277
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.970
<v Speaker 3>and the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama did,</v>

278
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did Egypt,</v>

279
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:44.200
<v Speaker 3>and he did Libya and he did a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

280
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.053
<v Speaker 3>Syria without the backing of Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet the left didn't say a damn </v>

281
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:48.541
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

282
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

283
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.334
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you on the hypocrite part </v>

284
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 3>because I listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

285
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was against the Libya thing because at</v>

286
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 3>the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the very,</v>

287
00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:59.014
<v Speaker 3>very least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to have a military </v>

288
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should have congressional approval.</v>

289
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.931
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the,</v>

290
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:03.764
<v Speaker 3>instead of calling it a war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they called it a kinetic military </v>

291
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And beyond that,</v>

292
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

293
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.153
<v Speaker 3>Libya did not pose a threat to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had no WMD because he gave them up </v>

294
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 3>after we went into the war in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was scared.</v>

295
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Belief plus he gave up the WMD and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United Nations.</v>

296
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 3>He gave it to us if they're under lock </v>
<v Speaker 3>and key,</v>

297
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:22.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Tennessee as we speak.</v>

298
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.700
<v Speaker 3>So what was the rationale and where was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left?</v>

299
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.573
<v Speaker 3>The same people yelling and screaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>about George W dot Bush and Dick Cheney </v>

300
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 3>and neo-cons and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nation building.</v>

301
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Where were they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't say anything.</v>

302
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.950
<v Speaker 3>It's hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

303
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:33.581
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

304
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:36.280
<v Speaker 3>we don't have congressional </v>
<v Speaker 3>authorization right now.</v>

305
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 3>So I would assume by a lot of standards </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the left,</v>

306
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 3>Obama is probably a gun to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

307
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.763
<v Speaker 3>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're being consistent but they're </v>

308
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

309
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.660
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was the actual threat?</v>

310
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm with you on some of this in terms</v>

311
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 3>of that we all sort of pick our sides </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then our.</v>

312
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Our value suddenly changed depending on </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's in power,</v>

313
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think your principals you,</v>

314
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 3>you don't do that and I'd write it </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself to be a principal.</v>

315
00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.223
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I consider myself to be principled as </v>

316
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:00.771
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I.</v>

317
00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:01.604
<v Speaker 3>everything that I've said in the past </v>
<v Speaker 3>related to all this stuff still still </v>

318
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:05.374
<v Speaker 3>stands up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what was the actual threat from </v>

319
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Iraq?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

320
00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:08.794
<v Speaker 3>I know that that Saddam did horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and you've laid out a couple of </v>

321
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:12.281
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what?</v>

322
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 3>What was the actual threat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And George W dot Bush properly said that</v>

323
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 3>they were a grave and gathering danger </v>
<v Speaker 3>after nine slash 11.</v>

324
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.583
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent of the American people </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought we were going to get hit again </v>

325
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.670
<v Speaker 3>and thought that he was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger than nine slash 11.</v>

326
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 3>So George W Bush looks around and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are the threats?</v>

327
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 3>We were still technically at war against</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

328
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:30.154
<v Speaker 3>I was saying we went to war against him </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1991 and he promised to fully and </v>

329
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:33.994
<v Speaker 3>thoroughly declare his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his chemical and biological weapons he </v>

330
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 3>failed to do so he violated resolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>after resolution after resolution,</v>

331
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 3>and we feared that he would either use </v>
<v Speaker 3>them himself or give them to a terrorist</v>

332
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 3>and use them against us and make 9:11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked like a picnic.</v>

333
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.133
<v Speaker 3>That was a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We gave him 15 months to turn over this </v>

334
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:50.350
<v Speaker 3>stuff and he refused to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

335
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.363
<v Speaker 3>a Bush went to the ninth and it did turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>out that there were no nuclear weapons </v>

336
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 3>of mass destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

337
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe the weapons were there.</v>

338
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 3>We gave him 15 months to thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 3>declare what he did in that 15 months.</v>

339
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 3>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got rid of it.</v>

340
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not the only person that's said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

341
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Dave the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

342
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 3>the national intelligence director,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our top spy,</v>

343
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 3>his name is James Clapper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an office right now under Obama,</v>

344
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.073
<v Speaker 3>has publicly said he believes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein did in fact have </v>

345
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:18.470
<v Speaker 3>stockpile for WMD,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got rid of them in the,</v>

346
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.890
<v Speaker 3>during the 15 month run up to the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

347
00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:22.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israeli Mossad feels the same way.</v>

348
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:24.790
<v Speaker 3>And there's several other American </v>
<v Speaker 3>officials that have said that.</v>

349
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.250
<v Speaker 3>So I don't believe George W Bush got the</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence wrong.</v>

350
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.293
<v Speaker 3>We have 16 intelligence agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All 16 said at the highest level of </v>

351
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:32.554
<v Speaker 3>probability that Saddam Hussein had </v>
<v Speaker 3>stockpiles of chemical and biological </v>

352
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:36.154
<v Speaker 3>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama had the same CIA director who </v>

353
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:39.150
<v Speaker 3>served under Bill Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Tenant.</v>

354
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.143
<v Speaker 3>He said the likelihood that Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hussein had chemical weapons and </v>

355
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:43.474
<v Speaker 3>biological weapons was a slam dunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same people that call up George </v>

356
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 3>W Bush a moron when he wanted him to go.</v>

357
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 3>So all 16 of you guys say that he's this</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and you say you've got to George.</v>

358
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I just not feeling it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not going to do it,</v>

359
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 3>but he's a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So would you say that this is one of the</v>

360
00:14:57.951 --> 00:14:58.784
<v Speaker 3>cases that part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is a through line </v>

361
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 3>through everything we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss for the next hour,</v>

362
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 3>is that I don't know who to believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

363
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:06.350
<v Speaker 3>That's become a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So James Clapper,</v>

364
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 3>who you just mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the same guy,</v>

365
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.074
<v Speaker 3>the same CIA director who sat in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Congress and said that we're not </v>

366
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:14.534
<v Speaker 3>spying on Americans remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was scratching the top of his </v>

367
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 3>head because as they say in Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're lying,</v>

368
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 3>you touch the higher up you touch on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your face and the bigger the lie is,</v>

369
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.890
<v Speaker 3>and he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

370
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Speaker 3>we're not wittingly spying on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American public.</v>

371
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 3>We now know that that wasn't what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said was,</v>

372
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 3>I gave the least untruthful answer I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could give,</v>

373
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 3>but later on he admitted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so to me,</v>

374
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:33.430
<v Speaker 3>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

375
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.333
<v Speaker 3>He's legitimately honest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I guess he gave the least honest </v>

376
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:39.014
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He least untruthful and least </v>

377
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 3>untruthful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't I guess I guess.</v>

378
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:44.710
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't truthful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

379
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 3>it was classified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was classified.</v>

380
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't supposed to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

381
00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:48.884
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so without,</v>

382
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 3>without getting too caught up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>words though,</v>

383
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:51.663
<v Speaker 3>but do you think that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem that we just don't know who to </v>

384
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:54.014
<v Speaker 3>believe anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe our government </v>

385
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:56.900
<v Speaker 3>officials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We barely believe the media.</v>

386
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have my own issues with government,</v>

387
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:00.164
<v Speaker 3>but my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my problem with the Iraq war is that </v>

388
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Republicans failed to say what I've said</v>
<v Speaker 3>and defended.</v>

389
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Even Jeb Bush is not defended that </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

390
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.210
<v Speaker 3>He was asked when he first started </v>
<v Speaker 3>running.</v>

391
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.390
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about the rack?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wah,</v>

392
00:16:09.391 --> 00:16:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Wah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wah.</v>

393
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

394
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:12.584
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't even defend what your </v>

395
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 3>brother did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can other people do it?</v>

396
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 3>So I think Americans have forgotten why </v>
<v Speaker 3>we went there at one time,</v>

397
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.170
<v Speaker 3>73 percent of the American people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>support at this war.</v>

398
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 3>You have to remind people of why you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you've gone to war and remind people</v>

399
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:26.430
<v Speaker 3>what the reasons are and people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>forgotten it.</v>

400
00:16:26.431 --> 00:16:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Now they have this vague idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>George w Bush overreacted and,</v>

401
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.990
<v Speaker 3>and went in there and depose somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he just didn't like him.</v>

402
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

403
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.110
<v Speaker 3>that's why we were there and let's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that anymore.</v>

404
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.290
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of how people have given the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cliff notes version of what happened and</v>

405
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:41.990
<v Speaker 3>it's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what would you say to the people that</v>

406
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:42.824
<v Speaker 3>would argue that isis wouldn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now if we hadn't toppled sit down </v>

407
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 3>because he at least had for all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible things he was doing in the bath</v>

408
00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

409
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.883
<v Speaker 3>We're doing terrible things and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were executing people and throwing gays </v>

410
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:55.240
<v Speaker 3>off roofs and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

411
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.290
<v Speaker 3>using mustard gas on the courage and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff,</v>

412
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.393
<v Speaker 3>but at least he was keeping a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lid on the actual craziness that we're </v>

413
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:04.530
<v Speaker 3>seeing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

414
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.373
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my problem with that is that we don't </v>

415
00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:09.680
<v Speaker 3>know what Saddam Hussein would have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>had we not gone there,</v>

416
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 3>even though we didn't find the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stockpiles.</v>

417
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.830
<v Speaker 3>There were two people that George W Bush</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent to find the stockpiles.</v>

418
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.793
<v Speaker 3>One was named David k,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other was named chuck doll for both </v>

419
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.420
<v Speaker 3>of them said we didn't find any </v>
<v Speaker 3>stockpiles.</v>

420
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.800
<v Speaker 3>We screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

421
00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:25.970
<v Speaker 3>this guy was going to reconstitute his </v>
<v Speaker 3>WMD program and reconstitute his nuclear</v>

422
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the heat was off,</v>

423
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.480
<v Speaker 3>so we would have had a dope deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

424
00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second thing I say is that President</v>

425
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Obama pulled out all the truth because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he ran in 2008 and said the Iraq war was</v>

426
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 3>a dumb war.</v>

427
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.753
<v Speaker 3>We never should've gone there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Over the advice of Hillary as secretary </v>

428
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 3>of state over the advice of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary of defense,</v>

429
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.503
<v Speaker 3>Leon Panetta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the advice of his former secretary </v>

430
00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Speaker 3>of defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Gates,</v>

431
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 3>over the advice of the joint chiefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulled out all the troops.</v>

432
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 3>He was warned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do this,</v>

433
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 3>there'll be a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did it.</v>

434
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:53.874
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ray Odierno is a member of the joint </v>

435
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:56.964
<v Speaker 3>chiefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just retired and he gave a speech </v>

436
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 3>when he retired and he was asked if he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he believe that we should have left</v>

437
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:02.731
<v Speaker 3>people there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

438
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have we done so?</v>

439
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.160
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could have been dealt with,</v>

440
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.230
<v Speaker 3>so in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however you feel about it,</v>

441
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 3>when Obama walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inherited this mess,</v>

442
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 3>he should have made it better and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

443
00:18:12.061 --> 00:18:13.610
<v Speaker 3>He made it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in a way you're,</v>

444
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.350
<v Speaker 3>so you're sort of blaming both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in that,</v>

445
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:18.970
<v Speaker 3>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I guess I would blame both sides.</v>

446
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.813
<v Speaker 3>I want put words in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would blame both sides here and that </v>

447
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 3>we went to the wrong war and then by </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama leaving the way he did,</v>

448
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:26.124
<v Speaker 3>even though most of the Americans very </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly didn't want to be there anymore </v>

449
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:31.440
<v Speaker 3>and when he ran for president seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago that his whole thing was,</v>

450
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:32.730
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get out as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>

451
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.743
<v Speaker 3>but that then created the breeding </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground for this because we didn't leave </v>

452
00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:39.900
<v Speaker 3>in a in a sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go halfway with you.</v>

453
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.973
<v Speaker 3>We didn't go into the wrong war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went to the right war for the right </v>

454
00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:43.854
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the intelligence was good and I </v>

455
00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:48.000
<v Speaker 3>think the problem was when Obama came </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

456
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to get out so quickly that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>did not realize what the aftermath would</v>

457
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not the only one who said this.</v>

458
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Robert has written a book scathing </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>

459
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 3>the most scathing attack on a sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>commander in chief by a former member of</v>

460
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 3>cabinet member I've ever read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he even recently,</v>

461
00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 3>just a few days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave said that Obama's national security</v>

462
00:19:05.941 --> 00:19:08.580
<v Speaker 3>and foreign policy advisors are </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerously naive.</v>

463
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.620
<v Speaker 3>They see the world through this prism </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they want,</v>

464
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 3>which is why the Benghazi thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

465
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:17.880
<v Speaker 3>The reason that mid godly thing happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Obama's running in 2012 a GM is dead.</v>

466
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:18.883
<v Speaker 3>A GM is alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Osama bin Laden is dead and Qaeda is on </v>

467
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:21.961
<v Speaker 3>the run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>

468
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:22.794
<v Speaker 3>Ben Gazi was not thoroughly defendant </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they thought that the Libyans </v>

469
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 3>were happy with us because we got rid of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gaddafi.</v>

470
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

471
00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:29.970
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in my opinion,</v>

472
00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:30.804
<v Speaker 3>the Obama Administration sees the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>through their prism of this ridiculous </v>

473
00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:38.970
<v Speaker 3>idea that if we are nicer to people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reach out with an unclenched fists,</v>

474
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 3>they will reach out in kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world doesn't work that way.</v>

475
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:43.980
<v Speaker 3>We have bad people who hate us and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to deal with it.</v>

476
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm with you on that part for sure.</v>

477
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:48.870
<v Speaker 3>Because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think back to the big speech that</v>

478
00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Obama gave in Cairo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the,</v>

479
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 3>everyone said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the reset,</v>

480
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:54.930
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be different.</v>

481
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.093
<v Speaker 3>We're going to try to deal with people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in region less with more with </v>

482
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:01.410
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Middle East especially,</v>

483
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:02.244
<v Speaker 3>but most of the world we were in more of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a precarious place now than I don't </v>

484
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.270
<v Speaker 3>think any part of the world is better </v>
<v Speaker 3>off with Obama in a.</v>

485
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.330
<v Speaker 3>and I think that you look at polls now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George W Bush left office,</v>

486
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

487
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.963
<v Speaker 3>in the low thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any president has been </v>

488
00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 3>that unpopular in my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at polls now,</v>

489
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.670
<v Speaker 3>more people like George W Bush didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Obama.</v>

490
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:21.683
<v Speaker 3>Obama's rating is at 45 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton's at this juncture in the </v>

491
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:26.520
<v Speaker 3>seventh year of his term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was at 65 percent.</v>

492
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Most American believer on the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>track economically.</v>

493
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 3>And most Americans believe we're on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong track in terms of foreign policy.</v>

494
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

495
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.530
<v Speaker 3>So I don't want to get too lost in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in just foreign policy.</v>

496
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:35.364
<v Speaker 3>So last thing on this is a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying sort of sounds like </v>

497
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:38.724
<v Speaker 3>neoconservative stuff to me is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you be a libertarian and a </v>

498
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.750
<v Speaker 3>neoconservative?</v>

499
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.583
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this is what you're getting to </v>

500
00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:45.054
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is sort of why you don't like Ran </v>

501
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.513
<v Speaker 3>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do those things seemed like they </v>

502
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:48.814
<v Speaker 3>have nothing to do with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet I know that there's a lot of people </v>

503
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 3>that do sort of get what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying.</v>

504
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the term neoconservatives and to me as a</v>

505
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 3>four letter word is a term that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>invent to,</v>

506
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 3>to malign somebodies position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the world realistically.</v>

507
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.890
<v Speaker 3>I think we have enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to deal with them.</v>

508
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not believe,</v>

509
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:06.580
<v Speaker 3>as you did just now pointed out that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should have gone to war in,</v>

510
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.460
<v Speaker 3>in Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in doing anything unless</v>

511
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 3>it's consistent with our national </v>
<v Speaker 3>security interests.</v>

512
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 3>When Jimmy Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

513
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the Shah of Iran under the bus </v>

514
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.020
<v Speaker 3>in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that all about?</v>

515
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 3>He did it because he wanted freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to liberate the people who are</v>

516
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 3>behind bars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same people we now call terrorists.</v>

517
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.253
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the ones that Obama force the </v>

518
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:28.780
<v Speaker 3>shaw to let out of prison and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately topple the regime.</v>

519
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 3>What's that all about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not our job to impose democracy.</v>

520
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:36.991
<v Speaker 3>It's our job to make sure that countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not our enemies.</v>

521
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:37.834
<v Speaker 3>Our countries are doing things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent with our own national </v>

522
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 3>security interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

523
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 3>that's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

524
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:42.964
<v Speaker 3>So you don't want to nation build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to do things that you consider </v>

525
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.860
<v Speaker 3>sort of defensive posture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

526
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.220
<v Speaker 3>We went into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

527
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.103
<v Speaker 3>a Haiti I think during Bill Clinton's </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration because they were having </v>

528
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.010
<v Speaker 3>difficulties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not our job.</v>

529
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get this right.</v>

530
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Speaker 3>So I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at my notes for this.</v>

531
00:21:56.861 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 3>According to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

532
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 3>you are black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that correct?</v>

533
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 3>That is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not African American.</v>

534
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:05.284
<v Speaker 3>That's not a term I like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come you don't like the term as </v>

535
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born and raised in America.</v>

536
00:22:08.831 --> 00:22:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I've never been to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

537
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.790
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I an African American?</v>

538
00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:13.624
<v Speaker 3>Most of my people that have been here </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer than most of other other people </v>

539
00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:17.050
<v Speaker 3>in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

540
00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.220
<v Speaker 3>yet most people don't have a hyphen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

541
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an Italian American,</v>

542
00:22:20.921 --> 00:22:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Greek American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Romanian American.</v>

543
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:23.883
<v Speaker 3>It's an absurd term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a term that Jesse Jackson almost </v>

544
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:29.500
<v Speaker 3>single handedly cram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cram down the throats of our media.</v>

545
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:30.334
<v Speaker 3>And after Jackson began to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>why a black should have some connection </v>

546
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 3>to Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden New York Times,</v>

547
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:36.874
<v Speaker 3>La Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the media began using that </v>

548
00:22:38.201 --> 00:22:39.120
<v Speaker 3>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the excellence.</v>

549
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

550
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:40.603
<v Speaker 3>I personally don't use the term African </v>
<v Speaker 3>American that much because one time I </v>

551
00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:46.300
<v Speaker 3>had a guest on the show and I referred </v>
<v Speaker 3>to her is African American.</v>

552
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:46.601
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

553
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually Jamaican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

554
00:22:48.371 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess that that goes to your point.</v>

555
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.660
<v Speaker 3>And I remember reading one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

556
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:53.420
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

557
00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.253
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was given a description of some suspect </v>

558
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 3>who had done some crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was running away,</v>

559
00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

560
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 3>he was described as an African American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you know where he was from?</v>

561
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Goodman from Africa coming from Jamaica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Canada.</v>

562
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.620
<v Speaker 3>So what are they going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

563
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.453
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of that when someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like [inaudible] I know you really rail </v>

564
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:11.110
<v Speaker 3>against Jesse Jackson and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys on the left that use,</v>

565
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.020
<v Speaker 3>and I want to talk a lot about identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

566
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 3>So the guys that use these phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they going for?</v>

567
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

568
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.423
<v Speaker 3>their goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goal is to tell black people that </v>

569
00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:22.294
<v Speaker 3>were victims that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination and racism remain major </v>

570
00:23:24.431 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 3>problems in America when in fact they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

571
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

572
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.330
<v Speaker 3>they want black people to vote for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party.</v>

573
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.510
<v Speaker 3>The Democratic Party gets a 95 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the black vote.</v>

574
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:35.623
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason they get it is because </v>

575
00:23:36.521 --> 00:23:37.354
<v Speaker 3>blacks are convinced that the number one</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue facing the country right now is </v>

576
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 3>social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

577
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:42.930
<v Speaker 3>white cops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

578
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.280
<v Speaker 3>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>systemic racism,</v>

579
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.560
<v Speaker 3>microaggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

580
00:23:46.561 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 3>a new word that come up with and as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of nonsense.</v>

581
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:49.694
<v Speaker 3>And number one problem domestically </v>
<v Speaker 3>facing this country is a breakdown of </v>

582
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:53.070
<v Speaker 3>the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

583
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.020
<v Speaker 3>President Obama said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a black kid or kid,</v>

584
00:23:57.021 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 3>not just the black kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A kid raised without a dad is five times</v>

585
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:00.764
<v Speaker 3>more likely to be poor and commit crimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine times more likely to drop out of </v>

586
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:05.780
<v Speaker 3>school and 20 times more likely to end </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in jail.</v>

587
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.823
<v Speaker 3>So you're far more likely to end up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>jail without having a dad than you are </v>

588
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:10.600
<v Speaker 3>because of a white racist cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

589
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.473
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you wouldn't not acknowledge that </v>

590
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:14.650
<v Speaker 3>there are some systemic issues.</v>

591
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.503
<v Speaker 3>And give me an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me what you think the most </v>

592
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 3>instamatic racist issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

593
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that because black people in</v>

594
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:23.384
<v Speaker 3>most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in many cases we're descendants of </v>

595
00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:27.230
<v Speaker 3>slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That racism as a,</v>

596
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.860
<v Speaker 3>as an institution that in 2000 a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of it just exists.</v>

597
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.813
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand and 15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That gives me the most blatant racist </v>

598
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:36.170
<v Speaker 3>example you can come up with right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

599
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:37.483
<v Speaker 3>I think you could probably find evidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in general cops or the cops are </v>

600
00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:48.281
<v Speaker 3>more willing to shoot if the perpetrator</v>
<v Speaker 3>is black.</v>

601
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:49.754
<v Speaker 3>What's your date of Nyu?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your basis for saying that last </v>

602
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.940
<v Speaker 3>year will look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people would say,</v>

603
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:54.840
<v Speaker 3>look what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know what they would say,</v>

604
00:24:54.841 --> 00:24:55.674
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about what the facts are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine hundred and 65 people were shot by </v>

605
00:24:57.801 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 3>cops last last year and killed four </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of them were white cops shooting</v>

606
00:25:01.671 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 3>unarmed blacks in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Chicago in 2011,</v>

607
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 3>21.</v>

608
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.160
<v Speaker 3>People were shot and killed by cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

609
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.330
<v Speaker 3>in 2015 there were seven a in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a third black,</v>

610
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:12.830
<v Speaker 3>a third white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a third Hispanic.</v>

611
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Seventy percent of the homicides are </v>
<v Speaker 3>black on black,</v>

612
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 40 per month,</v>

613
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:20.540
<v Speaker 3>almost 500 in the per year last year in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicago.</v>

614
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.470
<v Speaker 3>And 75 percent of them are unsolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the black lives matter on that,</v>

615
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.560
<v Speaker 3>the idea that a racist white cop </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting unarmed black people is apparel</v>

616
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 3>to black people is bs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is complete and total bs.</v>

617
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.693
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for these so-called </v>

618
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.423
<v Speaker 3>activists saying this is the assumption </v>
<v Speaker 3>that racism remains a major problem in </v>

619
00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:40.940
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The media,</v>

620
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:41.774
<v Speaker 3>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially MSNBC runs down whenever a </v>

621
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:45.690
<v Speaker 3>black cop shoots somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

622
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.380
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

623
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:46.850
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

624
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.380
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some march on Washington.</v>

625
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A black people,</v>

626
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 3>half the homicides in this country are </v>
<v Speaker 3>committed by and against black people.</v>

627
00:25:53.571 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Last year there were 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>homicides.</v>

628
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.070
<v Speaker 3>Not talking about suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about homicides.</v>

629
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Half of them were black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 six percent of them black on black.</v>

630
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Of that 7,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the black on black lives matter.</v>

631
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:07.250
<v Speaker 3>People on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's where you would say that this</v>

632
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:08.084
<v Speaker 3>is purely because of social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>purely because they want ultimately for </v>

633
00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:15.590
<v Speaker 3>people to be angry enough to just keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>voting democrat.</v>

634
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And where's,</v>

635
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.533
<v Speaker 3>where's the evidence of a lack of social</v>
<v Speaker 3>justice when a black suspect is killed </v>

636
00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 3>by a cop?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believe me,</v>

637
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:25.790
<v Speaker 3>the media's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are watching it.</v>

638
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

639
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.183
<v Speaker 3>and justice will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will for the most part to occur in </v>

640
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Baltimore where Freddie gray was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freddie gray died in a van,</v>

641
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:35.900
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Died in a van.</v>

642
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a city that's a 45 percent.</v>

643
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Black City Council is 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrat.</v>

644
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 3>The majority of city council is black.</v>

645
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.700
<v Speaker 3>The top cop at the time was with black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The number two cop with black,</v>

646
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 3>the majority of the command staff is </v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

647
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.920
<v Speaker 3>the mayor is black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the age is black.</v>

648
00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:53.893
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet here we are talking about </v>

649
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:55.411
<v Speaker 3>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

650
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:56.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absurd.</v>

651
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.230
<v Speaker 3>It's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's funny,</v>

652
00:26:58.231 --> 00:26:59.064
<v Speaker 3>I find myself caught in between this a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit as a liberal where I want to </v>

653
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:05.580
<v Speaker 3>always try to defend the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in this case,</v>

654
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 3>the other being black people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always sympathetic to that.</v>

655
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

656
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

657
00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.120
<v Speaker 3>At the same time I hear you laying out a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty solid.</v>

658
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are just the facts.</v>

659
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you something else too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was just a study,</v>

660
00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.450
<v Speaker 3>a university of Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

661
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.130
<v Speaker 3>and it turns out cops were more </v>
<v Speaker 3>reluctant,</v>

662
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.993
<v Speaker 3>more hesitant to pull the trigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the blacks black suspect than a </v>

663
00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 3>white suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

664
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.673
<v Speaker 3>probably because of the fear of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>accused of racially profiling and the </v>

665
00:27:28.231 --> 00:27:30.960
<v Speaker 3>fear that the civil rights establish it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to come down on him.</v>

666
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.730
<v Speaker 3>So if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

667
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 3>whites are more likely to be shot by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cop under,</v>

668
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 3>under certain circumstances than a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than a,</v>

669
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.870
<v Speaker 3>than a black person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in last 30 or 40 years,</v>

670
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.003
<v Speaker 3>the number of percentage of suspects </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed by cops who are black has </v>

671
00:27:45.151 --> 00:27:47.190
<v Speaker 3>declined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy five percent.</v>

672
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.143
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the percentage of whites killed by cops </v>

673
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 3>has flatlined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

674
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 3>And so if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are more concerned about shooting</v>

675
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 3>black people for fear that they're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be called racist.</v>

676
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.750
<v Speaker 3>And almost all every one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>incidents,</v>

677
00:27:57.751 --> 00:27:58.584
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Eric Gardener in in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York who died because he was selling </v>

678
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:02.124
<v Speaker 3>loosies and we resisted arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether there's Tamir rice in Cleveland </v>

679
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:05.790
<v Speaker 3>who hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was twirling around the gun,</v>

680
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:06.803
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Michael Brown in Ferguson </v>
<v Speaker 3>who had just a committed and strong arm </v>

681
00:28:10.441 --> 00:28:11.274
<v Speaker 3>robbery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost every one of these incidents </v>

682
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:13.554
<v Speaker 3>involve somebody resisting arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you just do what the police </v>

683
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:16.320
<v Speaker 3>tell you?</v>

684
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 3>My Dad said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I get pulled over,</v>

685
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 3>had my hand at 10:00,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have my hand at 2:00</v>

686
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.830
<v Speaker 3>say yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Sir.</v>

687
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.770
<v Speaker 3>Make sure my paperwork is in order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I feel the cop is mistreating me,</v>

688
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.900
<v Speaker 3>get a badge number and deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Later on.</v>

689
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.943
<v Speaker 3>If Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama and the whole group of them told </v>

690
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 3>black people to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have a lot fewer of these things to</v>

691
00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 3>deal with in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

692
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:38.671
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

693
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:39.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

694
00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:40.464
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hearing a lot of what you're saying </v>

695
00:28:41.141 --> 00:28:41.974
<v Speaker 3>in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as a black conservative then who now </v>

696
00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've laid out your case there,</v>

697
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 3>but you haven't laid out yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked,</v>

698
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:49.463
<v Speaker 3>I asked you to name the most important </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of racism and you gave white </v>

699
00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:54.720
<v Speaker 3>cops going after black people and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I told you,</v>

700
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.920
<v Speaker 3>gave you the facts for that.</v>

701
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.720
<v Speaker 3>So that's nonsense that you must have </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

702
00:28:57.721 --> 00:29:00.210
<v Speaker 3>What else does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think racism remains a problem in</v>

703
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:00.791
<v Speaker 3>America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give it to.</v>

704
00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it remains a problem.</v>

705
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.760
<v Speaker 3>How do you not even tell me it may not </v>
<v Speaker 3>be systemic in that we have.</v>

706
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're not being hired </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're black.</v>

707
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:09.860
<v Speaker 3>There's no systemic reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

708
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.580
<v Speaker 3>legal reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that exists,</v>

709
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:14.640
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that racism as a general,</v>

710
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.943
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some.</v>

711
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I need some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some specifics that you gave me,</v>

712
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:19.560
<v Speaker 3>the white cop thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

713
00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:21.150
<v Speaker 3>Give me another example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is a problem?</v>

714
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.480
<v Speaker 3>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

715
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.333
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a black conservative telling me how </v>

716
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:26.790
<v Speaker 3>to know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you get people to come around?</v>

717
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:27.624
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the one who made the assertion </v>

718
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 3>that racism remains a major problem in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

719
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.283
<v Speaker 3>I asked you to give me an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gave me white cops going after </v>

720
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:33.984
<v Speaker 3>blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

721
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.330
<v Speaker 3>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't hold it up very well.</v>

722
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It was the other argument you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the other thing?</v>

723
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:39.803
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that it's systemic in that </v>

724
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.660
<v Speaker 3>in the sort of macro sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an ad.</v>

725
00:29:43.661 --> 00:29:45.470
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what it is you're,</v>

726
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.020
<v Speaker 3>you're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

727
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:46.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

728
00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.340
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believe me,</v>

729
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:49.174
<v Speaker 3>that's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting into school bs that </v>

730
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 3>we have a race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have affirmative action.</v>

731
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.180
<v Speaker 3>So a black person with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with an sat and a GPA of x,</v>

732
00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.033
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get into a school faster and </v>

733
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 3>easier than a white person with an sat </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a gpa of x.</v>

734
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.570
<v Speaker 3>and if going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to school is a route to the middle</v>

735
00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:07.404
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make an argument that blacks </v>

736
00:30:08.381 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 3>have an easier route to middle to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle class.</v>

737
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.050
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking about a black poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

738
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 3>the poorer you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more accessible loans and grants are</v>

739
00:30:17.801 --> 00:30:18.790
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

740
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:19.190
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

741
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem,</v>

742
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 3>the biggest burden that black people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have in my opinion,</v>

743
00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:24.620
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the percentage of blacks,</v>

744
00:30:24.621 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 3>75 percent of them that are raised </v>
<v Speaker 3>without fathers,</v>

745
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that has every other social negative</v>

746
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 3>consequences connected to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crime,</v>

747
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:33.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not being able to compete economically </v>

748
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:37.300
<v Speaker 3>in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being more likely to be arrested.</v>

749
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.460
<v Speaker 3>That's the number one problem facing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>black community.</v>

750
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:44.110
<v Speaker 3>And when I hear people telling me about </v>
<v Speaker 3>systemic racism or unconscious racism,</v>

751
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me an example.</v>

752
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.650
<v Speaker 3>And almost nobody can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

753
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:48.543
<v Speaker 3>so the family stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll follow your logic there and </v>

754
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.423
<v Speaker 3>family stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What can actually be done about that </v>

755
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's a big reverse.</v>

756
00:30:55.901 --> 00:30:57.430
<v Speaker 3>The welfare state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

757
00:30:57.431 --> 00:30:59.740
<v Speaker 3>in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90,</v>

758
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 3>1900,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at census reports,</v>

759
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.490
<v Speaker 3>a black kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it or not,</v>

760
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 3>with slightly more likely to be born to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a nuclear family than a white kid.</v>

761
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Even during slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

762
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:10.114
<v Speaker 3>a black kid was more likely to be born </v>
<v Speaker 3>under a roof with his biological mother </v>

763
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:14.014
<v Speaker 3>and biological father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then today what's happened is we </v>

764
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:20.320
<v Speaker 3>launched this so called war on poverty </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sixties were literally,</v>

765
00:31:20.321 --> 00:31:21.154
<v Speaker 3>Lyndon Johnson sent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were knocking on doors and I </v>

766
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:26.940
<v Speaker 3>lived in the sixties and people knocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>on doors uprising.</v>

767
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Women of their availability to welfare </v>
<v Speaker 3>provided there was no man in the house.</v>

768
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.103
<v Speaker 3>And we went from 25 percent of black </v>
<v Speaker 3>being born outside of wedlock and 65 to </v>

769
00:31:35.321 --> 00:31:36.154
<v Speaker 3>75 percent right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look at how much money that we </v>

770
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:39.600
<v Speaker 3>spent on welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

771
00:31:39.601 --> 00:31:40.434
<v Speaker 3>in the lines are parallel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a neutron bomb dropped on this </v>

772
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:44.710
<v Speaker 3>country and not just in the black </v>
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>

773
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.580
<v Speaker 3>but on people in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

774
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.613
<v Speaker 3>at one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only about five percent of whites were </v>

775
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:49.774
<v Speaker 3>born outside of wedlock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now 25 percent of whites are born </v>

776
00:31:52.001 --> 00:31:52.834
<v Speaker 3>outside of wedlock.</v>

777
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.490
<v Speaker 3>I was in college in 1970 and there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>report called the Moynihan report.</v>

778
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Negro family,</v>

779
00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:03.640
<v Speaker 3>a case for national action is written by</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal by a man who became a Democratic</v>

780
00:32:03.641 --> 00:32:07.180
<v Speaker 3>senator for from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the time 25 percent of black kids</v>

781
00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:08.380
<v Speaker 3>are born outside of wedlock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

782
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this number is,</v>

783
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.470
<v Speaker 3>is horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we don't do something about it,</v>

784
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 3>it could get even higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

785
00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:16.150
<v Speaker 3>fast forward 25 percent of white kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now born outside of wedlock.</v>

786
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.220
<v Speaker 3>It is the number one problem in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

787
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.550
<v Speaker 3>And what we've done in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is we've economically incentivized women</v>

788
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:24.610
<v Speaker 3>to marry the government and we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed men to abandoned their financial</v>

789
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:26.620
<v Speaker 3>and more responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now we have this.</v>

790
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.510
<v Speaker 3>So do you think the left has done this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

791
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think then that as a,</v>

792
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:31.744
<v Speaker 3>as a black conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the biggest issue is it's </v>

793
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:36.590
<v Speaker 3>impossible to have this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

794
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the stuff we're talking about right</v>

795
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 3>now is rarely discussed in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

796
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:42.314
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've written some books about it and </v>

797
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 3>people talk about it every now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

798
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:47.300
<v Speaker 3>but we rarely have this discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

799
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.283
<v Speaker 3>and this is where I will agree with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the left has made language such a </v>

800
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:52.334
<v Speaker 3>problem and everyone's so trigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>warnings and safe space that we're </v>

801
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 3>afraid that if you have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

802
00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.250
<v Speaker 3>that somehow I'm going to come off </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

803
00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not where we were,</v>

804
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.013
<v Speaker 3>where we don't have the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have the conversation because </v>

805
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:03.860
<v Speaker 3>the left within have to look in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mirror and go,</v>

806
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:04.694
<v Speaker 3>Jesus h Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at what I've done and they don't </v>

807
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:07.814
<v Speaker 3>want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a radio show for almost 25 </v>

808
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:10.604
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've invited Jesse Jackson on 50 times </v>

809
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 3>60 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've invited our sharpened on that.</v>

810
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.850
<v Speaker 3>That number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a maxine waters,</v>

811
00:33:16.851 --> 00:33:17.684
<v Speaker 3>another loud mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black woman around here with running </v>

812
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:19.940
<v Speaker 3>around talking about racism.</v>

813
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:20.863
<v Speaker 3>She won't come on my show either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to deal with these </v>

814
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

815
00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Let's have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm wrong,</v>

816
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 3>tell me I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me how I'm wrong.</v>

817
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 3>Give me your data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me your facts.</v>

818
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Tell me what you got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I could quote the,</v>

819
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.423
<v Speaker 3>the Brookings Institution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a liberal think tank and the </v>

820
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.293
<v Speaker 3>Heritage Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a conservative think tank and </v>

821
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:36.404
<v Speaker 3>they will both tell you that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between crime and bad </v>

822
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 3>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

823
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:42.950
<v Speaker 3>and going to prison and not having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dad.</v>

824
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.040
<v Speaker 3>So this is not just a liberal kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing or conservative kind of thing.</v>

825
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:49.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a real world kind of thing and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to have that conversation.</v>

826
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I have never heard a reporter ask Obama </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the connection between the rise of</v>

827
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:57.420
<v Speaker 3>the single parent household and the rise</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

828
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of welfare spending.</v>

829
00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard anybody ask him that </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

830
00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Not one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

831
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.830
<v Speaker 3>And so as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

832
00:34:03.831 --> 00:34:04.221
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

833
00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:05.054
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

834
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 3>desire not to have this conversation for</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear that then will cause you to rethink</v>

835
00:34:09.771 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 3>your assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A psychologist would call that cognitive</v>

836
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:13.750
<v Speaker 3>dissonance the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

837
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this anxiety that you feel when you have</v>

838
00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:18.620
<v Speaker 3>had your assumptions challenged and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do it.</v>

839
00:34:18.621 --> 00:34:19.510
<v Speaker 3>It's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

840
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.420
<v Speaker 3>So how then would someone like you or </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that believes in what the things</v>

841
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:24.254
<v Speaker 3>that you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you wrestle away a little bit of </v>

842
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:29.330
<v Speaker 3>the narrative from the black lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter folks,</v>

843
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.373
<v Speaker 3>because obviously you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell the true care about the same </v>

844
00:34:31.911 --> 00:34:32.550
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I do.</v>

845
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.100
<v Speaker 3>I tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about,</v>

846
00:34:34.101 --> 00:34:34.934
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one cause of preventable </v>

847
00:34:36.351 --> 00:34:39.470
<v Speaker 3>death for young white men is car </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents.</v>

848
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.513
<v Speaker 3>The number one cause of preventable </v>
<v Speaker 3>death for young black men is homicide </v>

849
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 3>committed by other young black men.</v>

850
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.423
<v Speaker 3>I tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give the facts and the facts are </v>

851
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:50.220
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

852
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.380
<v Speaker 3>So facts or racist Hashtag facts are </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

853
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

854
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:56.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

855
00:34:56.421 --> 00:34:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

856
00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.660
<v Speaker 3>another black conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Webb,</v>

857
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:00.494
<v Speaker 3>you probably know Sirius Xm and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox News contributor and I had been </v>

858
00:35:04.221 --> 00:35:05.054
<v Speaker 3>doing a progressive show awhile back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on with someone and they didn't </v>

859
00:35:08.601 --> 00:35:11.360
<v Speaker 3>know him personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nor knew that I was friends with him and</v>

860
00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:14.390
<v Speaker 3>they kept saying he's the token black </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy on Fox right now.</v>

861
00:35:14.391 --> 00:35:17.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you get plenty of token boot </v>
<v Speaker 3>licker,</v>

862
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.210
<v Speaker 3>uncle Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sambo,</v>

863
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.210
<v Speaker 3>sambo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Coconut as in Brown on the outside,</v>

864
00:35:23.211 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 3>white on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Oreo same concept,</v>

865
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.060
<v Speaker 3>a the antichrist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got a hold of because they've</v>

866
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:29.923
<v Speaker 3>got to maligned somebody like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a bigger threat to their whole </v>

867
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:33.704
<v Speaker 3>ideology than almost anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A black guy who does not believe that </v>

868
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:38.274
<v Speaker 3>he's a victim of black guy who believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in hard work and personal </v>

869
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:40.644
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

870
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 3>A black guy who doesn't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>handouts.</v>

871
00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Black guy doesn't believe in the welfare</v>
<v Speaker 3>state of black guy.</v>

872
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:45.930
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't believe in affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>

873
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.913
<v Speaker 3>I am the antithesis of everything they </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand for and therefore I can't just be </v>

874
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:52.780
<v Speaker 3>dealt with with facts and everybody with</v>
<v Speaker 3>X.</v>

875
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.310
<v Speaker 3>I've got to be maligned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to be a castaway.</v>

876
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.660
<v Speaker 3>I've got to be treated as as if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>darth vader.</v>

877
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what the left does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So That's interesting.</v>

878
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.540
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where I've really struggled with</v>

879
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.970
<v Speaker 3>my guys on the left because in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is actually showing it's race.</v>

880
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

881
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't have the same right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an opinion.</v>

882
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 3>If somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard rush limbaugh be called</v>

883
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 3>anti white because he criticizes hillary</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Left,</v>

884
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.820
<v Speaker 3>but I criticize black left people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm and I'm,</v>

885
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.713
<v Speaker 3>I'm anti-black.</v>

886
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.220
<v Speaker 3>It's bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's racism.</v>

887
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Calling somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An uncle Tom is as offensive.</v>

888
00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:28.480
<v Speaker 3>It's calling somebody an inward lover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

889
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.210
<v Speaker 3>So when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the black community and politics.</v>

890
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.360
<v Speaker 3>So I got you on a bunch of bunch of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

891
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.463
<v Speaker 3>The black community in a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't for some of the things that the </v>

892
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:41.281
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party is for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

893
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Because the black community a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

894
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:46.980
<v Speaker 3>and it has a lot to do with the church </v>
<v Speaker 3>is more socially conservative.</v>

895
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:47.843
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that that connects black </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to the Democratic Party in my </v>

896
00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:52.164
<v Speaker 3>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this notion of social justice and </v>

897
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:56.490
<v Speaker 3>this notion that racism remains a major </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in America.</v>

898
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.473
<v Speaker 3>Look down the list of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of things that black people like and </v>

899
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:00.623
<v Speaker 3>support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blacks are more pro life than whites </v>

900
00:37:03.271 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blacks were more anti gay marriage,</v>

901
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:06.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

902
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.823
<v Speaker 3>than whites were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons its </v>

903
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:09.564
<v Speaker 3>proposition passed here in California is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the way blacks and browns </v>

904
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:12.090
<v Speaker 3>voted.</v>

905
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't vote that way,</v>

906
00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:14.580
<v Speaker 3>but it's the way a lot of blacks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>browns did.</v>

907
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

908
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.203
<v Speaker 3>blacks want to be wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reason Donald Trump is </v>

909
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 3>getting about 25 percent of black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is five times by the way,</v>

910
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:23.853
<v Speaker 3>the percentage that Mitt Romney got is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of Donald Trump's swagger and </v>

911
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:28.210
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

912
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.220
<v Speaker 3>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

913
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.600
<v Speaker 3>being proud that he's made money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

914
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 3>and so and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the inner city,</v>

915
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really fascinating little piece</v>

916
00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:38.280
<v Speaker 3>right there because I never want one </v>
<v Speaker 3>more quick one.</v>

917
00:37:38.281 --> 00:37:39.114
<v Speaker 3>This is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Democratic Party is completely </v>

918
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:43.800
<v Speaker 3>beholden to the teacher's union and vice</v>
<v Speaker 3>versa.</v>

919
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:44.923
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the union is adamantly opposed to </v>

920
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:48.570
<v Speaker 3>vouchers where the money follows the kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than the other way around.</v>

921
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Inner city black women and fathers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their inner city,</v>

922
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.663
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown women and Brown fathers want </v>

923
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.930
<v Speaker 3>vouchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They realized the schools suck.</v>

924
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.690
<v Speaker 3>I went to crenshaw high school in south </v>
<v Speaker 3>central right now,</v>

925
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.800
<v Speaker 3>three percent.</v>

926
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:02.663
<v Speaker 3>That's not a typo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three percent of kids can do math at </v>

927
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:05.754
<v Speaker 3>grade level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to send my kid to that school </v>

928
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.390
<v Speaker 3>because I don't have enough money to </v>
<v Speaker 3>send my kid to a better school.</v>

929
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.920
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

930
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.740
<v Speaker 3>it's an assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

931
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.590
<v Speaker 3>there's a program called the DC hope </v>
<v Speaker 3>scholarship program where every year,</v>

932
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents who subscribed to the,</v>

933
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.063
<v Speaker 3>to the program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's four times as many people wanting </v>

934
00:38:22.171 --> 00:38:26.160
<v Speaker 3>to get in as there are seats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will give a kids about 10 to $12,000</v>

935
00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:31.161
<v Speaker 3>to go to a non a DC government school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every two years when it's over Obama</v>

936
00:38:31.711 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 3>and the Democrats climate try to shut it</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

937
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 3>And the reason they don't is a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>black parents go to the streets,</v>

938
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 3>have a press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark crying.</v>

939
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:38.404
<v Speaker 3>And so all my kids doing better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of anything more damaging </v>

940
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.253
<v Speaker 3>to a kid's future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to send him to a school where it's a </v>

941
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:50.150
<v Speaker 3>crip school where the kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

942
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.780
<v Speaker 3>are not learning where a lot of them are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not learning because they don't care.</v>

943
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:53.853
<v Speaker 3>And where the whole level is now dumbed </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to cater to that lowest common </v>

944
00:38:58.361 --> 00:39:00.460
<v Speaker 3>denominator in a class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a result,</v>

945
00:39:00.461 --> 00:39:04.810
<v Speaker 3>you have kids that have a poor sat </v>
<v Speaker 3>scores and they otherwise would,</v>

946
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:07.090
<v Speaker 3>if they had a chance to go somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>else that challenged them.</v>

947
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so inner city parents want vouchers.</v>

948
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Young black people when they're told </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the benefits of privatizing social</v>

949
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:16.740
<v Speaker 3>security,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

950
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:21.770
<v Speaker 3>want to do it because 65 years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>blacks die sooner than whites do.</v>

951
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.990
<v Speaker 3>And when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all your contribution to social security</v>

952
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:26.824
<v Speaker 3>go poof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to being able to distill it </v>

953
00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:30.760
<v Speaker 3>to your child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When black duck taught about this,</v>

954
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:31.594
<v Speaker 3>young blacks want the opportunity to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>their money into an account that they </v>

955
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:35.800
<v Speaker 3>can control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they get 65 years old,</v>

956
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 3>they have real money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So privatizing social security vouchers,</v>

957
00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.890
<v Speaker 3>a abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same sex marriage,</v>

958
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:42.783
<v Speaker 3>all of these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black are really not in lockstep with </v>

959
00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:45.844
<v Speaker 3>the Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Democratic Party has </v>

960
00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:48.330
<v Speaker 3>successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

961
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 3>convinced blacks that racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this white cop,</v>

962
00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:52.323
<v Speaker 3>this is widespread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that man's out to get you and vote for </v>

963
00:39:55.061 --> 00:39:56.140
<v Speaker 3>us and we'll deal with it.</v>

964
00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 3>So how much of this is a messaging?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably if I grant you all of that,</v>

965
00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:01.174
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of this is just a messaging </v>

966
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 3>problem by the Republicans because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to me,</v>

967
00:40:04.661 --> 00:40:05.494
<v Speaker 3>and I've said this several times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone like Tim Scott who is a </v>

968
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:12.020
<v Speaker 3>black Republican senator from the south,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

969
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.680
<v Speaker 3>He should be a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only of the black community,</v>

970
00:40:14.681 --> 00:40:16.510
<v Speaker 3>but he should really be a hero of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

971
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this is a successful black.</v>

972
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.460
<v Speaker 3>Could be an American hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really should be.</v>

973
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he should some,</v>

974
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 3>certainly at least at the very least be </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger in the national debate.</v>

975
00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't he a bigger surrogate for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever he's going to support?</v>

976
00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I assume it will be a republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

977
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.640
<v Speaker 3>why is this guy lost in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the scheme of things?</v>

978
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:34.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same reason that black vote 95 </v>

979
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:39.110
<v Speaker 3>percent for the Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is considered to be a,</v>

980
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.000
<v Speaker 3>an uncle Tom.</v>

981
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.860
<v Speaker 3>He's a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a black Republican,</v>

982
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:42.431
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

983
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:44.680
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's some sort of Unicorn.</v>

984
00:40:44.681 --> 00:40:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

985
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.020
<v Speaker 3>that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how they feel.</v>

986
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:47.943
<v Speaker 3>So then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do as a Republican to break </v>

987
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:51.521
<v Speaker 3>this narrative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

988
00:40:51.521 --> 00:40:52.260
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You told,</v>

989
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.270
<v Speaker 3>tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

990
00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:54.104
<v Speaker 3>You tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously there has to be something </v>

991
00:40:55.961 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 3>bigger than messaging here because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

992
00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 3>it telling me the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>90,</v>

993
00:40:59.321 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 3>95,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an uphill fight.</v>

994
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:02.134
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me there is a access of </v>

995
00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:04.774
<v Speaker 3>indoctrination and you have the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have academia and you have </v>

996
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:08.020
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

997
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 3>all of which tell black people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're victims.</v>

998
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most professors are to the left.</v>

999
00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.013
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media certainly is off to the left </v>

1000
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.473
<v Speaker 3>and holly was to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you get up and you're </v>

1001
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:22.960
<v Speaker 3>indoctrinated all the time with things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like social justice,</v>

1002
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:24.480
<v Speaker 3>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1003
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.580
<v Speaker 3>the man's out to get you a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need a higher minimum wage.</v>

1004
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.100
<v Speaker 3>You name the left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1005
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.090
<v Speaker 3>a policy and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

1006
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.033
<v Speaker 3>and you pick it up through osmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why when we first started the </v>

1007
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:35.180
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1008
00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I hope to move you towards the center </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say,</v>

1009
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I hope to move you towards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1010
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:40.220
<v Speaker 3>towards the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the center.</v>

1011
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to happen because.</v>

1012
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.273
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing you can tell me I </v>

1013
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:45.914
<v Speaker 3>haven't heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I probably can say some things your </v>

1014
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 3>audience hasn't heard a because La </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times,</v>

1015
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 3>New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN,</v>

1016
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 3>ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>NBC,</v>

1017
00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 3>CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York Times,</v>

1018
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:55.311
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>

1019
00:41:55.311 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 3>these are all to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1020
00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.430
<v Speaker 3>left wing position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1021
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hear a why,</v>

1022
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:02.970
<v Speaker 3>how and where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1023
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.550
<v Speaker 3>but the other position you won't hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you watch a Fox News or listen to</v>

1024
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:11.090
<v Speaker 3>talk radio and a lot of people won't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it if you make them,</v>

1025
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 3>if you pay them.</v>

1026
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.673
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I hope it's clear in our 40 minutes </v>

1027
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:16.580
<v Speaker 3>or so together so far when I say I'm on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left,</v>

1028
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I consider myself a classic liberal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I stand for liberal principles.</v>

1029
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 3>John Stuart mill type liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

1030
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:22.930
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1031
00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:23.840
<v Speaker 3>that's not a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1032
00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:26.360
<v Speaker 3>and I know in a lot of ways that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you a conservative.</v>

1033
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.450
<v Speaker 3>You're a Jack Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a kind of Democrat.</v>

1034
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 3>He cut taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a cold warrior.</v>

1035
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 3>He will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He liked hunting.</v>

1036
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 3>He liked the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't really show you how stupid</v>

1037
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 3>the words are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I did at the top of the no shows</v>

1038
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 3>you how the Democratic Party has evolved</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the left and abandoned principles.</v>

1039
00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:43.610
<v Speaker 3>My mom was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a Democrat,</v>

1040
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.000
<v Speaker 3>my mom was a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad was a republican all his life and</v>

1041
00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Speaker 3>my mom stopped voting for the Democratic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Party and she said,</v>

1042
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:52.340
<v Speaker 3>as many people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't leave the Democratic Party.</v>

1043
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.650
<v Speaker 3>They left me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't like welfare.</v>

1044
00:42:54.651 --> 00:42:55.484
<v Speaker 3>She didn't like the idea of rewarding </v>
<v Speaker 3>people just because you had a kid and </v>

1045
00:42:58.731 --> 00:43:00.450
<v Speaker 3>they'd given you more money when you had</v>
<v Speaker 3>an additional kids.</v>

1046
00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.293
<v Speaker 3>She didn't like any of all of that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she started voting for George w Bush or </v>

1047
00:43:03.531 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1048
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.300
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two election cycles.</v>

1049
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.250
<v Speaker 3>So it's really ironic that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>messaging.</v>

1050
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.084
<v Speaker 3>It's the fact that the country and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country in general has gone to the left </v>

1051
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:12.103
<v Speaker 3>and the Democrats to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a greater degree than Republicans </v>

1052
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:16.190
<v Speaker 3>have gone to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The country has changed in part,</v>

1053
00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:17.630
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of immigration,</v>

1054
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.613
<v Speaker 3>including illegal immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who are coming to the country </v>

1055
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:22.880
<v Speaker 3>illegally from third world countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Mexico.</v>

1056
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I talk about limited government.</v>

1057
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.630
<v Speaker 3>They believe healthcare is a right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're taught that in Mexico,</v>

1058
00:43:29.631 --> 00:43:30.464
<v Speaker 3>they're taught that other places and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they come here in America and they pull </v>

1059
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:34.370
<v Speaker 3>that lever for the Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why,</v>

1060
00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:35.204
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left wants borders to be poorest </v>

1061
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 3>because it changes the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed the electorate,</v>

1062
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 3>it changes the demographics and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1063
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 3>The Democratic Party has not won the </v>
<v Speaker 3>white vote since 1964.</v>

1064
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 3>The more white people there are in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

1065
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 3>the worst Democrats do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more left wing,</v>

1066
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 3>the more people of color there are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country,</v>

1067
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:51.943
<v Speaker 3>the best the left does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what incentive is there for them </v>

1068
00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:55.400
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to police the borders?</v>

1069
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 3>What incentive is there for them to shut</v>
<v Speaker 3>down on sanctuary cities,</v>

1070
00:43:58.650 --> 00:43:59.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1071
00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.920
<v Speaker 3>to stop catch and release?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't,</v>

1072
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:01.933
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a very subtle and very </v>

1073
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.270
<v Speaker 3>diabolical changing or the mentality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country by left wing people so that</v>

1074
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:09.104
<v Speaker 3>a state like California could never vote</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Ronald Reagan as they did in the </v>

1075
00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:12.494
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could never vote for Richard Nixon as </v>

1076
00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:14.174
<v Speaker 3>they did in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have New York and California just </v>

1077
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.360
<v Speaker 3>write them off and there's 10 or 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>states now that we fight over.</v>

1078
00:44:20.361 --> 00:44:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Everything else has now written off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

1079
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:23.623
<v Speaker 3>So at the top of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was laying out some of the </v>

1080
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:26.420
<v Speaker 3>principles that we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1081
00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I saw classical liberalism falling into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conservative category,</v>

1082
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.883
<v Speaker 3>as you just said.</v>

1083
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.933
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because while I consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself a classical liberal and we can </v>

1084
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:38.070
<v Speaker 2>lay out every liberal principle there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would defend.</v>

1085
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1086
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:40.223
<v Speaker 2>it's scary to me because the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we get so caught up in words </v>

1087
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1088
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.293
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be considered a </v>

1089
00:44:45.991 --> 00:44:49.980
<v Speaker 2>conservative because I'm a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a scary proposition,</v>

1090
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1091
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:51.640
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1092
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:52.503
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about limited government personal </v>

1093
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:54.474
<v Speaker 2>responsibility as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you've told me is that you are </v>

1094
00:44:56.641 --> 00:44:57.474
<v Speaker 2>really a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody on my camp far more so than </v>

1095
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:01.950
<v Speaker 2>somebody on Bernie Sanders camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1096
00:45:01.951 --> 00:45:02.784
<v Speaker 2>I'm liberal in that I'm for gay marriage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mind if you smoke weed in </v>

1097
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 2>your bedroom as a general rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like lower taxes,</v>

1098
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:12.630
<v Speaker 2>but I think we could have a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax at some level,</v>

1099
00:45:12.631 --> 00:45:14.640
<v Speaker 2>so we probably disagree a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1100
00:45:14.641 --> 00:45:15.474
<v Speaker 2>I do think you should if you keep making</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more and especially as you're </v>

1101
00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:20.280
<v Speaker 2>getting into the dozens of millions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of millions.</v>

1102
00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:21.114
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have a progressive tax that </v>

1103
00:45:21.961 --> 00:45:22.794
<v Speaker 2>would attack the taxes people more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily for the 90 percent </v>

1104
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 2>tax that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Bernie wants.</v>

1105
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1106
00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:30.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the economics.</v>

1107
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.120
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you,</v>

1108
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:35.520
<v Speaker 3>why is it that nobody gave Dick Cheney </v>
<v Speaker 3>love?</v>

1109
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Because Cheney had a more progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>position on same sex marriage than Obama</v>

1110
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:42.200
<v Speaker 3>did when Obama was still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're changing,</v>

1111
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:43.283
<v Speaker 3>evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheney Cheney didn't have it until he </v>

1112
00:45:44.731 --> 00:45:46.230
<v Speaker 3>was out of office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1113
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1114
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:48.530
<v Speaker 3>it's a little disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he did,</v>

1115
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 3>he still years before Obama said he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>in favor of gay marriage,</v>

1116
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.093
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in favor of allowing states to </v>

1117
00:45:54.901 --> 00:45:57.530
<v Speaker 3>determine this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that years before that,</v>

1118
00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.710
<v Speaker 3>while he was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

1119
00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.593
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that was while he was all </v>
<v Speaker 3>I know was years before Obama because </v>

1120
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.353
<v Speaker 3>Obama became president 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not only said that he was in favor </v>

1121
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 3>of traditional marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said God was in the mix.</v>

1122
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.930
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is no longer mix four years ago.</v>

1123
00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Then God got out of the mix.</v>

1124
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:15.743
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point is that Dick Cheney said that </v>

1125
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:20.670
<v Speaker 3>he supported same sex marriage on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>state by state basis.</v>

1126
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.653
<v Speaker 3>Well before the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did well before Obama did well before </v>

1127
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:25.224
<v Speaker 3>Hillary did gotten olaf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So isn't actually well that I think </v>

1128
00:46:28.861 --> 00:46:30.810
<v Speaker 3>would just go to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because politicians are pandering.</v>

1129
00:46:30.811 --> 00:46:31.644
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that that makes Obama </v>

1130
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.050
<v Speaker 3>anymore of a liar than any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>politician make.</v>

1131
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.700
<v Speaker 3>As much as they will just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

1132
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm paying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about.</v>

1133
00:46:37.651 --> 00:46:38.484
<v Speaker 3>I get you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about why somebody didn't </v>

1134
00:46:40.111 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 3>give it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give it a couple of attaboys on that.</v>

1135
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.103
<v Speaker 3>I know that people on the left hate him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called him a neocon and believe he was </v>

1136
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 3>whispering and George w Bush's ear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>got Bush to do all sorts of bad things,</v>

1137
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:50.243
<v Speaker 3>but I would've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've thought on this issue since </v>

1138
00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:53.370
<v Speaker 3>the left considered such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such an important issue.</v>

1139
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1140
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.230
<v Speaker 3>that they would not have given it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of bit.</v>

1141
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.920
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you don't consider same</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex marriage to be that big of a deal?</v>

1142
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:04.810
<v Speaker 2>To me it's a give people equality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then let's not think about it anymore.</v>

1143
00:47:04.811 --> 00:47:05.530
<v Speaker 2>That would.</v>

1144
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I,</v>

1145
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I think the number one issue in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country is self defense.</v>

1146
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:10.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1147
00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.090
<v Speaker 3>and the number one domestic policy issue</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1148
00:47:12.091 --> 00:47:13.740
<v Speaker 3>as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the destruction of the family.</v>

1149
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 3>These other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a same sex marriage,</v>

1150
00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:18.750
<v Speaker 3>war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a global warming.</v>

1151
00:47:18.751 --> 00:47:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I considered to be further down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>

1152
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:21.330
<v Speaker 3>So the war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1153
00:47:21.331 --> 00:47:23.190
<v Speaker 3>you're actually for legalizing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1154
00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm for the government getting out of it</v>

1155
00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:27.870
<v Speaker 3>both federally and at the state level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:31.480
<v Speaker 3>And that would be an interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this may be a little boring for your,</v>

1157
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:32.380
<v Speaker 3>for your viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1158
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:33.880
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1159
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the earlier in the 20th century,</v>

1160
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:41.290
<v Speaker 3>we had the war against alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The constitution was amended,</v>

1161
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.810
<v Speaker 3>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war against alcohol,</v>

1162
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 3>and then it was amended again when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided it didn't work.</v>

1163
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.670
<v Speaker 3>We've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since Richard Nixon,</v>

1164
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:49.504
<v Speaker 3>this war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the constitution was never amended for </v>

1165
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:53.254
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1166
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.333
<v Speaker 3>And I don't understand why people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the argument that it is illegal </v>

1167
00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:02.730
<v Speaker 3>what the federal government is doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in order to get rid of alcohol,</v>

1168
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Congress knew that they had to change </v>
<v Speaker 3>the constitution,</v>

1169
00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 3>which they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no power in article one,</v>

1170
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:09.994
<v Speaker 3>section eight that gives the federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>government the authority to wage a war </v>

1171
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:14.740
<v Speaker 3>on alcohol or a war on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1172
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:16.990
<v Speaker 3>on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to do the one on alcohol,</v>

1173
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:19.240
<v Speaker 3>they changed the constitution and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>rechanged it.</v>

1174
00:48:19.241 --> 00:48:21.280
<v Speaker 3>But they never did that for the war on </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

1175
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how much of that do you think goes to</v>

1176
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.290
<v Speaker 3>why the black family has been affected?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1177
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:28.540
<v Speaker 3>when you think about the amount of black</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1178
00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:29.374
<v Speaker 3>black men especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and minorities in general that are in </v>

1179
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:32.374
<v Speaker 3>jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now have pro for profit jails and a </v>

1180
00:48:34.631 --> 00:48:37.420
<v Speaker 3>huge percentage of these people are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>jail because of drug offenses.</v>

1181
00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that many about 12 to 15 percent,</v>

1182
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:40.390
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1183
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:41.240
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever.</v>

1184
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 3>That seems pretty significant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the percentage is,</v>

1185
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:44.284
<v Speaker 3>I think the war on drugs should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>rethought and we should deal with it as </v>

1186
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 3>a health problem and not a criminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice problem,</v>

1187
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.053
<v Speaker 3>but the reason for the large number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>black behind bars goes back to what I </v>

1188
00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:55.000
<v Speaker 3>said earlier about the breakdown of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>black family,</v>

1189
00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:56.183
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not being taught the right kinds of </v>

1190
00:48:57.221 --> 00:48:58.170
<v Speaker 3>values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1191
00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.580
<v Speaker 3>and that has all sorts of other social </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences including,</v>

1192
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a greater propensity to commit crime.</v>

1193
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:03.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1194
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.833
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's back up for a second because you </v>

1195
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.633
<v Speaker 3>quickly say something about Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know I follow you on twitter and </v>

1196
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.220
<v Speaker 3>you rail against Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I do.</v>

1197
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Basically your argument is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like kicking a puppy though.</v>

1198
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.850
<v Speaker 3>It's become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can tell you not.</v>

1199
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not that difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1200
00:49:18.301 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just the other night,</v>

1201
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:20.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>

1202
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.393
<v Speaker 3>you were tweeting a little bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Golden Globes and the targets that your </v>

1203
00:49:23.391 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 3>base was taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last night I saw you,</v>

1204
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on CNN,</v>

1205
00:49:27.551 --> 00:49:28.384
<v Speaker 3>Don Lemon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I had on last week was on the show </v>

1206
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:30.454
<v Speaker 3>last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about Tavis Smiley and </v>

1207
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:35.860
<v Speaker 3>you're not a fan of travis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've known him a long time.</v>

1208
00:49:35.861 --> 00:49:36.840
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1209
00:49:36.841 --> 00:49:38.870
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't preach what he practices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he is,</v>

1210
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.753
<v Speaker 3>a hardworking guy who came from Indiana </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a big poor family and has done </v>

1211
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:45.160
<v Speaker 3>quite well with his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And instead of telling people,</v>

1212
00:49:45.161 --> 00:49:46.480
<v Speaker 3>bust your butt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do what I did.</v>

1213
00:49:46.481 --> 00:49:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay focused.</v>

1214
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:50.440
<v Speaker 3>It's demands out to get you a social </v>
<v Speaker 3>injustice.</v>

1215
00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racism everywhere.</v>

1216
00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:52.504
<v Speaker 3>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood is an easy target because </v>

1217
00:49:54.551 --> 00:49:56.390
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Golden Globes,</v>

1221
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:03.813

<v Speaker 3>but they're all protected by armed </v>

1222
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:07.340
<v Speaker 3>security guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>applied into a Prius to get to and from </v>

<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ceremony.</v>

1228
00:50:14.321 --> 00:50:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying very few.</v>

1229
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I think very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very few.</v>

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.010
<v Speaker 3>They in big gas.</v>

1237
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:33.164
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a firm believer that a lot of them </v>

1238
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:34.964
<v Speaker 3>actually privately are supporting </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans or at least their voting </v>

1239
00:50:37.431 --> 00:50:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is this idea that,</v>

1240
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:41.140
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go on this.</v>

1241

<v Speaker 3>once your Kelsey grammer boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it count as you,</v>

1247
00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.793
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1248
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1249

<v Speaker 3>They can't be 100 percent a left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they will not say so because they </v>

1253
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:09.734
<v Speaker 3>know they won't get parts and you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that's not necessarily because they </v>

1254
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 3>believe those things as much as just the</v>
<v Speaker 3>structures in place.</v>

1255
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 3>It's bigotry in Hollywood that the open </v>

<v Speaker 3>empathetic people,</v>

<v Speaker 3>something that pisses them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're going to lose jobs.</v>

1264
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's talk a little bit about your </v>

1265
00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and think and think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>

1266
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.323
<v Speaker 3>these are the people who are in charge </v>
<v Speaker 3>of 80 percent of what we see on TV and </v>

1267
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 3>on and in movies.</v>

1268
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:45.943
<v Speaker 3>And if you come out and you're 20 or 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years old and you're a rising star and </v>

1269
00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:50.264
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1270
00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Listen to Larry elder's show the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1271
00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.713
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1272
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to vote Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finished,</v>

1273
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.810
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done now.</v>

1274
00:51:56.811 --> 00:51:57.644
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of power is that to influence </v>

1275
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 3>the minds of young people to shape this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country culturally,</v>

1276
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.093
<v Speaker 3>it is massive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a book called Primetime </v>

1277
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.940
<v Speaker 3>propaganda by a young man named Ben </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shapiro.</v>

1278
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.673
<v Speaker 3>We're getting them on the show and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because he looks so young and looks </v>

1279
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:14.330
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that means,</v>

1280
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.630
<v Speaker 3>he was able to get on the record all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these Hollywood producers,</v>

1281
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:21.710
<v Speaker 3>people that did golden girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that did cops and got them on the</v>

1282
00:52:21.711 --> 00:52:25.400
<v Speaker 3>record saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never hire a conservative.</v>

1283
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.620
<v Speaker 3>A conservative in this town will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>screwed.</v>

1284
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.750
<v Speaker 3>A conservative in this town cannot make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1285
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:32.810
<v Speaker 3>I intentionally put leftwing messages in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my fair.</v>

1286
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:33.763
<v Speaker 3>I try to influence culture this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has them all saying this and has an on </v>

1287
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:40.340
<v Speaker 3>tape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the book came out and it didn't make</v>

1288
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 3>any difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't say,</v>

1289
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:42.794
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say we ought to rethink our </v>

1290
00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 3>assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He interviewed Fred Silverman,</v>

1291
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:48.830
<v Speaker 3>who at one time as the head of ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CBS,</v>

1292
00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:49.683
<v Speaker 3>NBC has Fred Silverman on the record </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying a conservative cannot make it in </v>

1293
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:53.901
<v Speaker 3>this town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1294
00:52:53.901 --> 00:52:54.734
<v Speaker 3>if Hollywood has a great impact on how </v>
<v Speaker 3>we think on our culture and you have </v>

1295
00:52:58.251 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 3>this Gestapo essentially shutting out </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are conservative,</v>

1296
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.440
<v Speaker 3>what does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's scary to frightening to me.</v>

1297
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1298
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:07.784
<v Speaker 3>messaging messaging is everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which actually brings this back to what </v>

1299
00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:10.934
<v Speaker 3>you said about trump before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is sort of fascinating </v>

1300
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:13.723
<v Speaker 3>that he's polling better with the black </v>
<v Speaker 3>community is because he has this sense </v>

1301
00:53:16.911 --> 00:53:17.744
<v Speaker 3>of swagger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think you could probably relate </v>

1302
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.640
<v Speaker 3>directly back to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1303
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.190
<v Speaker 3>rap music and stuff like that.</v>

1304
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 3>These guys aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not ashamed of their success and</v>

1305
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:27.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in a weird way,</v>

1306
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:31.170
<v Speaker 3>trump is sort of doing the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact thing that you want,</v>

1307
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen.</v>

1308
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:33.653
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was another big reason </v>

1309
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:37.310
<v Speaker 3>that trump is scoring with white people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1310
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:38.453
<v Speaker 3>one of the most underpolled things in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country is how black people are </v>

1311
00:53:41.461 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 3>pissed off about illegal immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was younger,</v>

1312
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:47.700
<v Speaker 3>there was a movie that came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies called carwash,</v>

1313
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:49.400
<v Speaker 3>or Richard Pryor was in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1314
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.240
<v Speaker 3>and George or George Carlin was in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.720
<v Speaker 3>And it was about a day in the life of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this carwash in south central,</v>

1316
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:58.620
<v Speaker 3>not too far from where I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Virtually all the employees were black.</v>

1317
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.920
<v Speaker 3>I defy you to go to a car wash and south</v>
<v Speaker 3>central now and see any,</v>

1318
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:02.813
<v Speaker 3>any employee who's black illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigrants that come over and taking </v>

1319
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.400
<v Speaker 3>over this business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1320
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.413
<v Speaker 3>and black people see it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they realize it and they are angry </v>

1321
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:10.340
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1322
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Democratic Party,</v>

1323
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:12.864
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of what I said earlier about </v>

1324
00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:15.360
<v Speaker 3>trying to shift the electorate to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

1325
00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.081
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>

1326
00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:16.914
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown blacks under the bus on this </v>

1327
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:19.074
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of blacks who are aware of it </v>

1328
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.653
<v Speaker 3>or not happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Donald Trump's position on </v>

1329
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:24.450
<v Speaker 3>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1330
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:27.990
<v Speaker 3>resonated with a lot of black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing about,</v>

1331
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.120
<v Speaker 3>about Donald trump that I think in </v>
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>

1332
00:54:30.121 --> 00:54:31.360
<v Speaker 3>not just black people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1333
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.273
<v Speaker 3>is appealing to me anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not quite sure why some of my </v>

1334
00:54:34.711 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 3>fellow Republicans are so adamantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to Donald Trump.</v>

1335
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:41.190
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave can self fund.</v>

1336
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.680
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't need your money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1337
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:44.573
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump was at a group called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican Jewish coalition and he was </v>

1338
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:48.534
<v Speaker 3>asked a question about does he feel that</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Jerusalem should be the undivided </v>

1339
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:54.450
<v Speaker 3>capital of Israel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His answers not important.</v>

1340
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.610
<v Speaker 3>He said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1341
00:54:55.611 --> 00:54:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I haven't thought it </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1342
00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.340
<v Speaker 3>And he got booed and Donald trump looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and he said,</v>

1343
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.473
<v Speaker 3>I don't need your money now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy named Nelson Sheldon </v>

1344
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.273
<v Speaker 3>Adelson in Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a multibillionaire last election </v>

1345
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:08.453
<v Speaker 3>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave Newt Gingrich 10 million a lot </v>

1346
00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:12.840
<v Speaker 3>of money and a lot of people feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for that,</v>

1347
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.153
<v Speaker 3>Newt Gingrich is a tackle and Mitt </v>
<v Speaker 3>Romney and all the footage that he gave </v>

1348
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.750
<v Speaker 3>Democrats to use and the general </v>
<v Speaker 3>election,</v>

1349
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Romney might have one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the point.</v>

1350
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.460
<v Speaker 3>The point is he is a king maker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1351
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.413
<v Speaker 3>and right now he is trying to decide </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether he wants to give money to a Ted </v>

1352
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Cruz or Marco Rubio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has Los Vegas business interests.</v>

1353
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mad at him for doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pursue his interests.</v>

1354
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:36.023
<v Speaker 3>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he expected his phone call to return to </v>

1355
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 3>be returned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump can say,</v>

1356
00:55:39.511 --> 00:55:43.110
<v Speaker 3>screw you to all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that get subsidized for milk,</v>

1357
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.093
<v Speaker 3>the people that get subsidies for sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that get subsidies for this </v>

1358
00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:48.360
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous product known as ethanol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1359
00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unions that keep Amtrak running.</v>

1360
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.473
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump does not need their money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does not have to take their phone </v>

1361
00:55:54.961 --> 00:55:55.794
<v Speaker 3>call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's guy can really do what should </v>

1362
00:55:57.301 --> 00:56:00.990
<v Speaker 3>be done for the American people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to get all the crony capitalism</v>

1363
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:01.973
<v Speaker 3>and all these so called special </v>
<v Speaker 3>interests out of our government and get </v>

1364
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:05.034
<v Speaker 3>it down to the site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That oughta be Boeing gets money from </v>

1365
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:08.910
<v Speaker 3>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google gets money from the government.</v>

1366
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Dutch royal gets money from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1367
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.693
<v Speaker 3>This is corporate welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that happens is because </v>

1368
00:56:13.471 --> 00:56:14.304
<v Speaker 3>they give contribution to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians who in turn then do their </v>

1369
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:19.710
<v Speaker 3>bidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump does not need their money.</v>

1370
00:56:19.711 --> 00:56:20.544
<v Speaker 3>He is in a position to downsize the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government in a way unlike any other </v>

1371
00:56:23.861 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 3>politician</v>

1372
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.600
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1373
00:56:25.601 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 2>So there's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1374
00:56:26.831 --> 00:56:28.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of irony there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>

1375
00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:29.163
<v Speaker 2>what you're really talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's truly systemic political </v>

1376
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.810
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about it,</v>

1377
00:56:33.811 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 2>the money politics study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

1378
00:56:35.741 --> 00:56:36.574
<v Speaker 2>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should unite everybody across the </v>

1379
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 2>board about how messed up our system </v>
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>

1380
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:40.714
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now a la is going to get to team </v>

1381
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:43.413
<v Speaker 2>two football teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably Oakland and San Diego and St </v>

1382
00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Louis are all vying to come out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1383
00:56:48.161 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 2>all three of them used to play here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rams used to play here,</v>

1384
00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 2>open up to play here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the first a La chargers,</v>

1385
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.240
<v Speaker 2>one of the AFL teams started here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they moved to San Diego.</v>

1386
00:56:56.241 --> 00:56:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Now they don't want to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1387
00:56:57.641 --> 00:56:58.474
<v Speaker 2>Because their respective cities won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give them hundreds of billions of </v>

1388
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.163
<v Speaker 2>dollars in tax subsidies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why should a multibillionaire get </v>

1389
00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:06.544
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars from taxpayers who </v>
<v Speaker 2>then in turn have to pay all this to go </v>

1390
00:57:09.941 --> 00:57:13.600
<v Speaker 2>to the game and watch multimillionaire </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballplayers be?</v>

1391
00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like sitting corporate welfare,</v>

1392
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 2>that's molesting city field where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mets play in New York,</v>

1393
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 2>you know that it was funded by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly by taxpayer money,</v>

1394
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.023
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile the government's bailing </v>
<v Speaker 2>out Citibank who has their name on the </v>

1395
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:27.790
<v Speaker 2>whole thing is reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the trump thing,</v>

1396
00:57:27.791 --> 00:57:28.624
<v Speaker 2>real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things is in the first </v>

1397
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:30.574
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first republican debate about three </v>

1398
00:57:32.171 --> 00:57:33.710
<v Speaker 2>months ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought the,</v>

1399
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 2>the unmasking that he did was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of amazing,</v>

1400
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:38.890
<v Speaker 2>even though I disagree with him on </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everything,</v>

1401
00:57:38.891 --> 00:57:39.724
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they asked him about going to </v>

1402
00:57:40.721 --> 00:57:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Hillary's a daughter's wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1403
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:43.933
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes to Chelsea's wedding and he was </v>

1404
00:57:44.921 --> 00:57:45.671
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1405
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I give them money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show up the wedding.</v>

1406
00:57:48.101 --> 00:57:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give money to everybody.</v>

1407
00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm a business guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

1408
00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I got to do what I gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a weird way,</v>

1409
00:57:52.451 --> 00:57:53.350
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't like.</v>

1410
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:54.183
<v Speaker 2>So for my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for my liberal friends and my friends </v>

1411
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:56.014
<v Speaker 2>had left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you hate the messaging and you </v>

1412
00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:59.770
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the Muslim stuff and all that,</v>

1413
00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 2>even if you hate all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unmasking of the system.</v>

1414
00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:02.914
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I've also talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how Bernie and trump have a lot in </v>

1415
00:58:04.811 --> 00:58:05.644
<v Speaker 2>common because the core of what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is the biggest threat to the </v>

1416
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:09.390
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1417
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:12.070
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie and trump have a lot in common in</v>

1418
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:14.350
<v Speaker 2>the sense that the establishment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>scared to death of both of them.</v>

1419
00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1420
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:17.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie will make things worse.</v>

1421
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Taking over large corporations will make</v>
<v Speaker 2>things worse.</v>

1422
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:21.694
<v Speaker 2>Raising taxes on job creators will make </v>
<v Speaker 2>things worse with Donald trump wants to </v>

1423
00:58:24.911 --> 00:58:26.500
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will make things better.</v>

1424
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:28.480
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1425
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I barely got to any of the questions I </v>

1426
00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:31.990
<v Speaker 2>have here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a testament to you,</v>

1427
00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:33.550
<v Speaker 2>so I'm glad we've got to sit down.</v>

1428
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:34.383
<v Speaker 2>So let me end this thing and a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of the future where you think this </v>

1429
00:58:39.281 --> 00:58:41.560
<v Speaker 2>country is going in the next year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you.</v>

1430
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 2>So I sent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you supporting trump?</v>

1431
00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I haven't taken a position on anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>

1432
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.010
<v Speaker 2>so I will support whoever the nominee is</v>
<v Speaker 2>over Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.</v>

1433
00:58:51.011 --> 00:58:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1434
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:52.863
<v Speaker 2>Do you view he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary and Bernie both sort of as </v>

1435
00:58:54.611 --> 00:58:55.800
<v Speaker 2>equally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1436
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.790
<v Speaker 2>equally equally as equally bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1437
00:58:57.791 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you've,</v>

1438
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:00.550
<v Speaker 2>when you've asked Hillary to give the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>

1439
00:59:00.551 --> 00:59:03.190
<v Speaker 2>as Chris Matthews recently did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between a Democrat and a socialist,</v>

1440
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.250
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Debbie Wasserman Schultz,</v>

1441
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.180
<v Speaker 2>the chairwoman of the DNC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was asked the same question,</v>

1442
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:08.700
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1443
00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.573
<v Speaker 2>and Hillary has gone further to the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's threatened by Bernie </v>

1444
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.633
<v Speaker 2>Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's now come out by talking about a </v>

1445
00:59:13.601 --> 00:59:15.400
<v Speaker 2>surcharge tax on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1446
00:59:15.401 --> 00:59:17.980
<v Speaker 2>on millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't do that before and she's also</v>

1447
00:59:17.981 --> 00:59:19.450
<v Speaker 2>coming out on the left now on gun.</v>

1448
00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 2>She didn't want to do that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Bernie's pushed her to the left.</v>

1449
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.933
<v Speaker 2>So as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their positions are pretty much </v>

1450
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:25.290
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1451
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:26.143
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this may go to show why the system is </v>

1452
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:28.394
<v Speaker 2>just broken because both sides in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary process have to stake out these </v>

1453
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:34.300
<v Speaker 2>positions that they know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to govern by.</v>

1454
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Richard Nixon used to say when you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to win a presidency and the primary,</v>

1455
00:59:38.331 --> 00:59:40.610
<v Speaker 2>you run to the right and then when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>run into the general election,</v>

1456
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 2>you run to the center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of how it works.</v>

1457
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:45.920
<v Speaker 2>And the primary season you have to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your base and then kind of run to the</v>

1458
00:59:45.921 --> 00:59:47.660
<v Speaker 2>standard different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get independence.</v>

1459
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.770
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1460
00:59:48.771 --> 00:59:49.491
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well listen,</v>

1461
00:59:49.491 --> 00:59:50.324
<v Speaker 2>I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect we were going to agree </v>

1462
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:52.430
<v Speaker 2>on everything.</v>

1463
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 2>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1464
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I learned a little something here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you learned a little bit.</v>

1465
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you learned a little something </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1466
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:58.463
<v Speaker 2>So I see a glimmer in your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you move a little bit towards the </v>

1467
00:59:59.841 --> 01:00:00.674
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I consider my has a classical </v>

1468
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:03.500
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1469
01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider myself off the deep end</v>
<v Speaker 2>left and maybe I just,</v>

1470
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.413
<v Speaker 2>I think in general a lot of people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left are starting to realize how do </v>

1471
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:13.260
<v Speaker 2>you feel about vouchers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1472
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I think we should have vouchers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should have access to God.</v>

1473
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 2>action?</v>

1474
01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:19.670
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about giving a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>person or a brown person?</v>

1475
01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:20.504
<v Speaker 2>Additional points just because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>black and brown over some equally </v>

1476
01:00:22.971 --> 01:00:24.530
<v Speaker 2>qualified white person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you happy with that?</v>

1477
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't care.</v>

1478
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm being interviewed.</v>

1479
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:27.980
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1480
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:28.814
<v Speaker 2>I would say that I think at some time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point in America there was a </v>

1481
01:00:32.391 --> 01:00:33.224
<v Speaker 2>reason that it really did make sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because because some of the more </v>

1482
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:36.644
<v Speaker 2>systemic stuff still exists today and </v>
<v Speaker 2>today it probably doesn't make as much </v>

1483
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.983
<v Speaker 2>sense anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you would agree with me on that </v>

1484
01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:45.700
<v Speaker 2>because that's pretty much what you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think it ever made anything,</v>

1485
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:49.460
<v Speaker 2>but that's exactly why I want to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these conversations and why especially I</v>

1486
01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:50.294
<v Speaker 2>think that that liberals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians should realize that we're </v>

1487
01:00:53.421 --> 01:00:56.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of in the center together and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a way to,</v>

1488
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.313
<v Speaker 2>there's a way to work together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's exactly why I wanted to do </v>

1489
01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

1490
