1
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today as a student and </v>
<v Speaker 1>activist and the director of high school</v>

2
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>outreach for turning point USA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle [inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>You have welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me on.</v>

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've met a couple times.</v>

5
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:21.051
<v Speaker 1>We've done some events together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are seemingly wise beyond your </v>

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get to it.</v>

8
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Well actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a weird way,</v>

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:32.031
<v Speaker 1>I guess you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been sort of thrust into being </v>

10
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.301
<v Speaker 1>wise beyond your years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were obviously a survivor of the </v>

11
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:35.301
<v Speaker 1>parkland shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had your classmate calmer and Kasey,</v>

13
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a couple of weeks ago and he kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out,</v>

14
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to him that day and </v>

15
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>subsequently everything that's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just start there because that's</v>

16
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of what put you on the map.</v>

17
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll sort of preface it.</v>

18
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to refer myself as a </v>

19
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.451
<v Speaker 2>survivor because I wasn't in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>building that was shot into and I think </v>

20
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 2>that cheapens the pain and tragedy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were in the building.</v>

21
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what happened with me that day,</v>

22
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 2>it was fourth period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:06.911
<v Speaker 2>I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in my fourth period Class A and </v>

24
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:10.301
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden the alarms a ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go into the hallway and we're </v>

25
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 2>walking out and we hear two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two little pops.</v>

26
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if two textbooks fell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fire,</v>

27
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 2>fire works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really had no idea.</v>

28
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 2>So we run back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 2>and I go and reach for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

30
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the door to my classroom and the teacher</v>

31
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 2>locked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go into a nearby room,</v>

32
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 2>we get in there and we just hide for two</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours straight.</v>

33
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 2>We just hear pops and ambulances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up.</v>

34
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 2>So that was the freshman building and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire time we had no idea was going</v>

35
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

36
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 2>and then all throughout the entire time </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

37
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately or just villainizing guns,</v>

38
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second we got a second I got out of </v>

39
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 2>the closet that I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids were like,</v>

41
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 2>we have to be an air fifteens</v>

42
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not jump into the political </v>

43
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

44
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>because it's interesting just listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you hear about that.</v>

45
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:59.931
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the way you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing it almost sounds like you </v>

46
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:02.661
<v Speaker 1>weren't even there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just like a story that you </v>

47
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:02.661
<v Speaker 1>were telling in a bizarre way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once.</v>

48
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of this happens,</v>

49
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you find out now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dead students.</v>

50
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean to do a friend killed.</v>

51
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 2>So we get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get out of the closet,</v>

52
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>so takes us out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put their,</v>

53
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>air fifteens in our faces,</v>

54
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 2>take us out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to put our hands on the person </v>

55
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 2>in front of us walking outside and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout this,</v>

56
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:24.551
<v Speaker 2>the most disgusting thing was every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single corner of the entire block </v>

57
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 2>surrounding us was just filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>

58
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:30.341
<v Speaker 2>Cars was just like jam packed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I saw there was that whenever </v>

59
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>there was like someone crying or like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment of pain,</v>

60
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 2>the media would just surround them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>encapsulate them.</v>

61
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got home and I was really hoping </v>

62
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.621
<v Speaker 2>that this wouldn't be like a politicized</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacle with like mass media jumping </v>

63
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 2>the gun to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

64
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.870
<v Speaker 2>and sadly that was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was sitting there in shock,</v>

65
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.630
<v Speaker 2>seeing the numbers rise on the screens </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the death count,</v>

66
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 2>it was like so insane to internalize </v>
<v Speaker 2>what had just occurred because like </v>

67
00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 2>everyone's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>this will never happen to my school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could this happen to my school?</v>

69
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sad reality is it can happen to </v>

70
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.810
<v Speaker 2>any school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

71
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stoneman Douglas was in the most </v>

72
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.000
<v Speaker 2>affluent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low crime,</v>

73
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>city I think in southern Florida.</v>

74
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>And this happened at our school.</v>

75
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you know some of the kids that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed?</v>

76
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew one girl,</v>

77
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Helena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was in a class of my year back.</v>

78
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of time did you guys have </v>

79
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>to grieve because that you were already </v>
<v Speaker 1>alluding to this,</v>

80
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was as if the event happened,</v>

81
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>the shooting happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it seemingly,</v>

82
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.670
<v Speaker 1>there was no grieving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you guys were all over the </v>

83
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.670
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were all over twitter.</v>

84
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>You at all political people using you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and all sorts of different ways.</v>

85
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:44.281
<v Speaker 1>Just tell me a little bit about just </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the grieving and trying to be </v>

86
00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:44.281
<v Speaker 1>able to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old are you now?</v>

87
00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 17.</v>

88
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Trying to be 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

89
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:51.451
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 year old kids trying to just survive </v>

90
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unimaginably horrible.</v>

91
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how freshmen and sophomores</v>

92
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.300
<v Speaker 2>have managed to go through this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>

93
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm at least a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a junior at the time,</v>

94
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.470
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew the school have a better in </v>

95
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.470
<v Speaker 2>somewhat of my self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little more,</v>

96
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 2>build up more and a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>mature.</v>

97
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was absolutely no time to </v>

98
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.080
<v Speaker 2>grieve whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a few days after the shooting.</v>

99
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.460
<v Speaker 2>They already buses up to Tallahassee </v>
<v Speaker 2>till,</v>

100
00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:15.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like push to like tug on the </v>

101
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.661
<v Speaker 2>emotional heartstrings of Republicans to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pass legislation that the otherwise </v>

102
00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's they in that equation?</v>

103
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.850
<v Speaker 2>So there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.030
<v Speaker 2>members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

105
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.790
<v Speaker 2>in the Florida Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.100
<v Speaker 2>that like personally like coordinated </v>
<v Speaker 2>buses.</v>

107
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Parkland to Tallahassee.</v>

108
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what were your parents saying or the</v>

109
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:31.950
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.700
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

111
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:37.701
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed like the parents were </v>

112
00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:39.360
<v Speaker 1>almost gone now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now there is some of the parents that </v>

113
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.360
<v Speaker 1>are a little more high profile that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I see,</v>

114
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.370
<v Speaker 1>but it was as if you guys were just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>

115
00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:46.371
<v Speaker 1>That's what it felt like suddenly we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing on CNN and town halls and I want </v>

116
00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:49.701
<v Speaker 1>to talk a little bit about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just like that you were just used </v>

117
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:51.750
<v Speaker 1>all over the place with not even having </v>
<v Speaker 1>a moment to just digest what happened.</v>

118
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.110
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's how I don't think that </v>

119
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.110
<v Speaker 2>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

120
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Speaker 2>so here's what I think will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the kids saw what happened.</v>

121
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.890
<v Speaker 2>They were shocked as they should be and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they decided tack,</v>

122
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.130
<v Speaker 2>like we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can't happen to anyone else ever </v>

123
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.130
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do something.</v>

124
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.870
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what really occurred is that the </v>

125
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.870
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media jumped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped on this immediately,</v>

126
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just like put it to like a national </v>

127
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 2>scale and really used it to push a gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>control agenda.</v>

128
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I started speaking out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted to represent the other </v>

129
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 2>side of stone douglas who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in gun control.</v>

130
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just tell me a little bit about you </v>

<v Speaker 1>of and I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that stuff which is telling you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid.</v>

141
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

142
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you all the recap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me the story of my life story.</v>

143
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

144
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.650
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 2>so my parents came from Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They immigrated here.</v>

146
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom served in the IDF.</v>

147
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 2>They came here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing worked their way up.</v>

148
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>And then when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was at home they taught me Hebrew</v>

149
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.490
<v Speaker 2>and English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we only spoke Hebrew at home so I'm </v>

150
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>fluent Hebrew and they put me through </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and I was always the shortest kid</v>

151
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:15.731
<v Speaker 2>in the grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like always like I was just </v>

152
00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:17.801
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even shorter than the shortest girl in </v>

153
00:06:17.801 --> 00:06:17.801
<v Speaker 2>my grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like super short and like,</v>

154
00:06:17.801 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>what was it like in like eighth grade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was four foot eight,</v>

155
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 2>I was like legally it in eighth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll,</v>

156
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I got bullied a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I try not to have a victim hood </v>

157
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 2>mentality because I don't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and I think you agree with me</v>

158
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>

159
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was always bullied and I was </v>

160
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.091
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always smart so that Kinda went </v>

161
00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:40.211
<v Speaker 2>back on me a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was always put a lot and it built </v>

162
00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 2>up my self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>

163
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I was always like taking the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>

164
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 2>My parents would always push me to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hardest classes possible.</v>

165
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at Douglas,</v>

166
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 2>before all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

167
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone who I had a good social life,</v>

168
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would basically,</v>

169
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I would go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do my ap classes,</v>

170
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 2>go home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play video games,</v>

171
00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 2>so like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10:00</v>

172
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 2>PM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start homework to like start homework,</v>

173
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then finish it at 2:00</v>

174
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 2>AM and then have like five hours of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

175
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.360
<v Speaker 2>So that was my cycle was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was super addicted to video games </v>

176
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 2>and then the shooting happens and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned my entire life upside down.</v>

177
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 2>So it just completely changed me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at that moment,</v>

178
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to become much more mature.</v>

179
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in the adult world,</v>

180
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had responsibilities.</v>

181
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:23.740
<v Speaker 2>There are things that had to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

182
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I had to act a proper certain way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

183
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

184
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.440
<v Speaker 1>did you have any particular political </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs before all this because you're </v>

185
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.161
<v Speaker 1>definitely in terms of at least the kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the young people that are public </v>

186
00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>about all of this now that have come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of snowmen.</v>

187
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Douglas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

188
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:42.820
<v Speaker 1>you definitely are the one that seemed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that I know of is,</v>

189
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.890
<v Speaker 1>is the furthest right that is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>embraced conservatism and all that did.</v>

190
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Is that where you were politically to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear that?</v>

191
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.740
<v Speaker 2>They not about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents aren't political at all </v>

192
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all my political beliefs I have </v>

193
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.431
<v Speaker 2>developed myself and how I develop every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single political belief is just I look </v>

194
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:04.811
<v Speaker 2>at it straight from a rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical point of view with no emotions </v>

195
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:07.811
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can guess I'm not an </v>

196
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:07.811
<v Speaker 2>emotional person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like I think with,</v>

197
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:12.190
<v Speaker 2>with legislative decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to put a motion as far out of </v>

198
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 2>it as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do policies that,</v>

199
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 2>that actually solve the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just make you feel good.</v>

200
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for feel good policies.</v>

201
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.400
<v Speaker 1>You care about politics at all before </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of this or is this new?</v>

202
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care either.</v>

203
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 2>The 2016 election I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was somewhat into it after the </v>

204
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.021
<v Speaker 2>election I kind of didn't care as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was always somewhat of a second </v>

205
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:30.610
<v Speaker 2>amendment supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

206
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I,</v>

207
00:08:32.641 --> 00:08:34.890
<v Speaker 2>when I started speaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's really interesting.</v>

208
00:08:34.891 --> 00:08:39.891
<v Speaker 2>When I started speaking out a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a tidal wave of opposition,</v>

209
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

210
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.710
<v Speaker 2>my school was against me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone seemed like that,</v>

211
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my peers were against me and I try </v>

212
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.501
<v Speaker 2>not to do a victim mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to paint the picture of how </v>

213
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:51.501
<v Speaker 2>it actually was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seemed like the community,</v>

214
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream media and my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.810
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like I was going against every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single opposition,</v>

216
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was scared like this could,</v>

217
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 2>this could have ruined my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

218
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:04.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believed in what I was doing and I </v>

219
00:09:04.251 --> 00:09:04.251
<v Speaker 2>just power through it.</v>

220
00:09:04.251 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

221
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.400
<v Speaker 2>and just really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just stuck to my beliefs and didn't </v>

222
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.400
<v Speaker 2>let anyone tell me otherwise because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 2>when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was in Tallahassee,</v>

224
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were pushing Republican </v>

225
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>legislators to enact gun control </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation,</v>

226
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

227
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 2>gun control isn't going to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

228
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>I want to solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

229
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure that school school </v>
<v Speaker 2>shootings never happened.</v>

230
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.740
<v Speaker 2>What can I do to actually make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

231
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 2>And what can I do while protecting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second amendment?</v>

232
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Because I actually believe it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those fundamental rights of Americans.</v>

233
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 2>So while I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started speaking out and nobody cared,</v>

234
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.570
<v Speaker 2>like APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go to reporters and nobody </v>

235
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:43.570
<v Speaker 2>cared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to forcefully know,</v>

236
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 2>like talk to reporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

237
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a conservative.</v>

238
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Can I reach out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I managed to get a Leland </v>

239
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Vitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a contact with Louis that are at Fox and</v>

240
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I want them Fox and I did an interview </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Ben Shapiro psy and it blew </v>

241
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:56.720
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all the wild.</v>

242
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

243
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the first time I remember seeing.</v>

244
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all the while there's this extreme </v>

245
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:02.500
<v Speaker 2>opposition and the entire thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

246
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.130
<v Speaker 2>I've always had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

247
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Well I just wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

248
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
<v Speaker 1>because I know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of mock the media the way I do </v>

249
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.721
<v Speaker 1>now on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter and just sort of what </v>

250
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:14.491
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media has become and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they really activists and journalists </v>

251
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:14.680
<v Speaker 1>and that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

252
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.560
<v Speaker 1>but were you shocked when you were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to them and going,</v>

253
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a conservative or I want to defend </v>

254
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.811
<v Speaker 1>the second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a student from this school and </v>

255
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:24.940
<v Speaker 1>they're just blatantly ignoring you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or even.</v>

256
00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:29.941
<v Speaker 1>I know this is minor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I remember when a bunch of you </v>

257
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:32.761
<v Speaker 1>guys were all verified on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was with instagram as well.</v>

258
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.650
<v Speaker 1>It took me like three months after </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>

259
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that,</v>

260
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:39.730
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't really mean it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter in and of itself,</v>

261
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a symptom of sort of the broader </v>

262
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.460
<v Speaker 1>situation going on here with tech </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and media and all that.</v>

263
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Like were they flat out ignoring you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw them interviewing people.</v>

264
00:10:48.611 --> 00:10:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's here,</v>

265
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:51.880
<v Speaker 1>here's what occurred,</v>

266
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main organizers of that,</v>

267
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.060
<v Speaker 2>that you can recruit a solid group of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the march for our live kids.</v>

268
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 2>At this point they had solidified a </v>
<v Speaker 2>click and they wouldn't let anyone new </v>

269
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.390
<v Speaker 2>or with a different opposing view into </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

270
00:11:04.391 --> 00:11:06.130
<v Speaker 2>So I said I had to take matters into my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own hand.</v>

271
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.900
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in Tallahassee.</v>

272
00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:12.901
<v Speaker 2>I realized that the mainstream media is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing this for clicks because can </v>

273
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.640
<v Speaker 2>we think about it when shooting occurs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the mainstream media loves it.</v>

274
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Like they get great coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get great amount of views,</v>

275
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.240
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

276
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll switch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to like notoriety in addition </v>

277
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:25.360
<v Speaker 2>after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw that when someone,</v>

278
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.320
<v Speaker 2>there was a girl crying and Tallahassee </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the second she cried just,</v>

279
00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:34.321
<v Speaker 2>she got sworn by reporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw that they were just looking </v>

280
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:37.590
<v Speaker 2>for clicks and for headlines and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that they're really,</v>

281
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>they're not reading it for the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons and they're not gonna listen to </v>

282
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.690
<v Speaker 2>a rational or irrational young kid like </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

283
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in addition,</v>

284
00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I also realized that there was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme amount of just.</v>

285
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.010
<v Speaker 2>People were just getting benefiting off </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this so much.</v>

286
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm so the shooting when you realized </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of this occurred because the </v>

287
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:57.440
<v Speaker 2>shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I,</v>

288
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I try not to say his name ever because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that gives them to notarize them.</v>

289
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.240
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

290
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would post.</v>

291
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:09.090
<v Speaker 2>So here's what time did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the video of the shooter were </v>

292
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:09.090
<v Speaker 2>basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

293
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be the next school shooter </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Twenty Eighteen,</v>

294
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I want 20 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he basically says,</v>

295
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 2>you're all going to see me on the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

296
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.860
<v Speaker 2>And then Time magazine puts this video </v>
<v Speaker 2>up on Youtube.</v>

297
00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:24.861
<v Speaker 2>It gets three point 6 million views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing with all the other </v>

298
00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:24.861
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

299
00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 2>CNN talked about this exact clip and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically just still showed it on air.</v>

300
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the entire thing with the mainstream </v>

301
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.090
<v Speaker 2>media is doing is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

302
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.360
<v Speaker 2>they're just benefiting off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and what they don't realize </v>

303
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 2>that they're perpetuating the issue and </v>
<v Speaker 2>making it worse.</v>

304
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:41.611
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think daily wire of Ben is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a great decision with not showing </v>

305
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 2>their names and faces because it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical decision.</v>

306
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think government should impose </v>

307
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:47.280
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

308
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 2>on the mainstream media to not allow the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show their faces.</v>

309
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:53.581
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's an ethical and moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions that people should be taking </v>

310
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:53.581
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

311
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:53.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to be totally clear.</v>

312
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:57.731
<v Speaker 1>So after this shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was when Ben announced he's the </v>

313
00:12:57.731 --> 00:13:00.611
<v Speaker 1>editor of wired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are no longer going to show their </v>

314
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:00.611
<v Speaker 1>name days after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

315
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you started to see this,</v>

316
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>this issue with the media that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignoring people like you and they're </v>

317
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.761
<v Speaker 1>sort of making other people stars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going for the clicks and all of </v>

318
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:12.761
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

319
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make this about people </v>

320
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:17.850
<v Speaker 1>per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so that,</v>

321
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.011
<v Speaker 1>that little click of of kids that then </v>
<v Speaker 1>was all over the media and was getting </v>

322
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:22.430
<v Speaker 1>retweeted by every celebrity and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

323
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Were you trying to reach out to them at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all and just have that discussion or was</v>

324
00:13:26.631 --> 00:13:27.470
<v Speaker 1>it just very clear?</v>

325
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still try to have that discussion.</v>

326
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they first started speaking I said,</v>

327
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

328
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Someone speaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And originally when the movement started</v>

329
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.980
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it started,</v>

330
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember Cameron Caskey was on,</v>

331
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 2>on the car shouting the movement wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>an Antiguan movement.</v>

332
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 2>It was an anti school shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

333
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is quickly.</v>

334
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

335
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I gave him the morning guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like you're moving through the </v>

336
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.921
<v Speaker 2>direction of an anti gun movement and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that's beneficial at all.</v>

337
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.250
<v Speaker 2>So here's my point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried communicating and I,</v>

338
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 2>and I tried speaking on and they really </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't care in allowing me.</v>

339
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

340
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I have to go solo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I've been doing,</v>

341
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:09.571
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been open to discussion and </v>

342
00:14:09.571 --> 00:14:12.901
<v Speaker 2>open debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was one of the great things </v>

343
00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:12.901
<v Speaker 2>that we're a country where you can have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:12.901
<v Speaker 2>open discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

345
00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:17.820
<v Speaker 2>and just free expression of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think the Kanye thing is </v>

346
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.821
<v Speaker 2>somewhat great because regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you think of the person or </v>

347
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:20.821
<v Speaker 2>celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

348
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:20.821
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

349
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in favor of propping up </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities and their political opinion </v>

350
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.491
<v Speaker 2>simply because they're famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't need a lot of political </v>

351
00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:29.580
<v Speaker 2>expertise to say that I believe in free </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression,</v>

352
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 2>free thought,</v>

353
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

354
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.800
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't be a really controversial</v>
<v Speaker 1>position to be,</v>

355
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>to be staking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

356
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.640
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned cameron and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had them on the show a couple of weeks</v>

357
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going through a very interesting </v>

358
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.360
<v Speaker 1>evolution right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect I can figure out where this is</v>

359
00:14:44.361 --> 00:14:49.361
<v Speaker 1>going to end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually be much closer to your </v>

360
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:50.210
<v Speaker 1>position than the position that he sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of at right now.</v>

361
00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Because I just continually see that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of things.</v>

362
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 1>The more that he understands rights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things,</v>

363
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but I was happy to hear his thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that and he sat down with me.</v>

364
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 1>He sat down with Shapiro and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll continue to do that.</v>

365
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you guys been able to make any </v>

366
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.791
<v Speaker 1>piece with some of this stuff or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>must at least be enjoying the fact that </v>

367
00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:09.791
<v Speaker 1>somebody kind of coming around?</v>

368
00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:10.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

369
00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I think Cam's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what we're seeing right now</v>

370
00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:19.081
<v Speaker 2>is that he's matured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've all made so and cam have </v>

371
00:15:19.081 --> 00:15:22.501
<v Speaker 2>gone through like the same political </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash media experience so we can </v>

372
00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:24.100
<v Speaker 2>understand each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened with came as like,</v>

373
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:25.120
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've all made mistakes.</v>

374
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:30.121
<v Speaker 2>We've all said stuff we don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's matured and I've also matured </v>

375
00:15:30.121 --> 00:15:30.121
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I see,</v>

376
00:15:30.121 --> 00:15:34.590
<v Speaker 2>what I think is happening with Cam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a natural progression of just </v>

377
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.710
<v Speaker 2>having logical thought instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>

378
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And I think logic and facts moves you </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the political beliefs of being a</v>

379
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:39.970
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

380
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of this happens.</v>

381
00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of rock bottom of this was that</v>

382
00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:49.660
<v Speaker 1>CNN town hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was terrible.</v>

383
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just share your thoughts on that.</v>

384
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.500
<v Speaker 2>So here's what happened with the CNN </v>
<v Speaker 2>town hall.</v>

385
00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the kids that you saw there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were actually flown in on a private jet </v>

386
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.600
<v Speaker 2>from Tallahassee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So already at the time of the town hall </v>

387
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.800
<v Speaker 2>there was a solidified group click of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the kids that you see now,</v>

388
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:13.050
<v Speaker 2>and they won't let anything until they </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually flew these kids on a private </v>

389
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.740
<v Speaker 2>jet from Tallahassee to the town hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right there it was,</v>

390
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.990
<v Speaker 2>it was just simply,</v>

391
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 2>they were just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an anti gun debate and they were </v>

392
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.401
<v Speaker 2>just villainizing Rubio in Dana lasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>for things that had nothing into their </v>

393
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.160
<v Speaker 2>control whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't their fault.</v>

394
00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:31.161
<v Speaker 2>And Marco Rubio was villainized to such </v>
<v Speaker 2>an extreme extent and he's one of the </v>

395
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 2>best senators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

396
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.010
<v Speaker 2>so you've now connected with Rubio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

397
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

398
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I hate it because when people say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians just don't care.</v>

399
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It's just so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

400
00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:45.450
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do care.</v>

401
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

402
00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:51.951
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the greatest supporters of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the school violence act that we got </v>

403
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:51.951
<v Speaker 2>passed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

404
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:54.780
<v Speaker 2>and you just helped push it and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these senators don't want this to occur.</v>

405
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Kenny was and just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politicians want this to happen.</v>

406
00:16:58.771 --> 00:16:59.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just wrong.</v>

407
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any thoughts on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened that day in terms of </v>

408
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.600
<v Speaker 1>security or what should have happened or</v>
<v Speaker 1>should've or shouldn't have happened?</v>

409
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Because even now when you go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

410
00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:11.710
<v Speaker 1>depending on where you're getting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>news from this,</v>

411
00:17:11.711 --> 00:17:12.400
<v Speaker 1>it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:16.660
<v Speaker 1>they either step down or they didn't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>in or this or that or the other thing.</v>

413
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

414
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:18.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

415
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.810
<v Speaker 1>what should have happened in the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that you want to create in the </v>

416
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.790
<v Speaker 1>system that you want to create to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect this,</v>

417
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.370
<v Speaker 1>these schools from not having this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen again?</v>

418
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

419
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.740
<v Speaker 1>what should it happen that day?</v>

420
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.950
<v Speaker 2>What we saw at my school was simply an </v>
<v Speaker 2>utterly just massive and competence and </v>

421
00:17:35.951 --> 00:17:38.230
<v Speaker 2>failure of law enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

422
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:38.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

423
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.820
<v Speaker 2>So the shooter was flagged multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>times by the school,</v>

424
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.340
<v Speaker 2>by the school administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew he had mental issues.</v>

425
00:17:45.341 --> 00:17:47.960
<v Speaker 2>He was put into the promise program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

426
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 2>and knew that this kid was a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were 76 times the police.</v>

427
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 2>There were 76 times the police came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his house,</v>

428
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:55.620
<v Speaker 2>the retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>FBI reports,</v>

429
00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.770
<v Speaker 2>they knew that this kid was a threat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law enforcement was completely </v>

430
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.900
<v Speaker 2>incompetent at that level and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do absolutely anything.</v>

431
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knew this kid was an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened at school was,</v>

432
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.020
<v Speaker 2>was just utter incompetence in addition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he gets on campus,</v>

433
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.950
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just make a straight beeline for the</v>

434
00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:21.951
<v Speaker 2>freshman building and at the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time we had a school resource officer </v>

435
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.820
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

436
00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:27.821
<v Speaker 2>who heard the gunfire and came and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just hid in a corner while kids were </v>

437
00:18:27.821 --> 00:18:27.821
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>

438
00:18:27.821 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 2>And then three unarmed individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>rushed to save at three.</v>

439
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:35.781
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three on our went to the building and </v>

440
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 2>died trying to save kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we should have had,</v>

441
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.510
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I pushed for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way to stop a shooter who is </v>

442
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 2>active on campus is to have other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are armed.</v>

443
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:51.290
<v Speaker 2>The only way to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a cliche that you only way to </v>

444
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:51.290
<v Speaker 2>stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a gun,</v>

445
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:56.150
<v Speaker 2>and in addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the entire idea of a gun free </v>

446
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.080
<v Speaker 2>gun free zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is utterly stupid.</v>

447
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 2>It is just completely stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All it's doing is enticing.</v>

448
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 2>A target saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

449
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 2>you go here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's,</v>

450
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:08.991
<v Speaker 2>here's what's the school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The average response time from police </v>

451
00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 2>station to a school nationally is 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

452
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 2>The average time a school shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens is five minutes.</v>

453
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 2>That means the shooter has 15 minutes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever he wants.</v>

454
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.910
<v Speaker 2>If the school is a gun free zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's what I'm saying,</v>

455
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 2>at least allow teachers who have gone to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proper training,</v>

456
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ex military ex law enforcement to be </v>

457
00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.831
<v Speaker 2>armed because what that does is it sends</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only a message as a deterrent to a </v>

458
00:19:30.831 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 2>shooter that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

459
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 2>this school is armed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get in here,</v>

460
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:38.331
<v Speaker 2>your brains are going to be blown out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also says that that the school is in </v>

461
00:19:39.821 --> 00:19:44.821
<v Speaker 2>a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Free School is no longer a gun free </v>

462
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:44.821
<v Speaker 2>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

463
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you partly on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I would,</v>

464
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe you can explain this a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit further so I don't know that </v>

465
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I want guns in those classrooms even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

466
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:57.191
<v Speaker 2>So here's the license usage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are 25 states where </v>

467
00:19:57.191 --> 00:20:01.161
<v Speaker 2>teachers can be armed or not armed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools and all the hypotheticals that </v>

468
00:20:01.161 --> 00:20:01.680
<v Speaker 2>are pronounced.</v>

469
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

470
00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:06.250
<v Speaker 2>if a teacher shoots a student when </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another like,</v>

471
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.280
<v Speaker 2>like what if there's a school shooter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a teacher gets shot and there was a </v>

472
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.280
<v Speaker 2>gun on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does a student do?</v>

473
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.021
<v Speaker 2>It's these hypotheticals don't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 five states where teachers are </v>

474
00:20:15.021 --> 00:20:19.280
<v Speaker 2>already armed and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why not just have them have security </v>

475
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.930
<v Speaker 2>guards at specific?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>

476
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:26.931
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for having security guards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This entire issue is how do we best </v>

477
00:20:26.931 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 2>manage our funds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insecure our schools.</v>

478
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:33.230
<v Speaker 2>The thing with law enforcement officers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they cost a lot of money and </v>

479
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.090
<v Speaker 2>impoverished schools are ready need that</v>
<v Speaker 2>funding for materials.</v>

480
00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 2>And in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does not take a lot of training and a</v>

481
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:41.250
<v Speaker 2>lot of money to have a teacher to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>armed.</v>

482
00:20:41.251 --> 00:20:46.251
<v Speaker 2>And this has already been proven to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an initiative when you have teachers </v>

483
00:20:46.251 --> 00:20:46.950
<v Speaker 2>who are armed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shooter doesn't know who it,</v>

484
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a law enforcement officer,</v>

485
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:49.750
<v Speaker 2>you can clearly see who it is.</v>

486
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 2>So if you've one resource officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>school resource officer who's armed,</v>

487
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 2>the shooter comes and takes out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>school resource officer and then they're</v>

488
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 2>free to do whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's simply.</v>

489
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply giving teachers to have the </v>

490
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.371
<v Speaker 2>opportunity has a massive effect because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's up to their own will to do so they </v>

491
00:21:05.371 --> 00:21:07.180
<v Speaker 2>have to go through training and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to.</v>

492
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a concealed carry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nobody knows they have them.</v>

493
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So as you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like facts and logic.</v>

494
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

495
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Strictly facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facts don't care about your feelings.</v>

496
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:18.670
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>

497
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:19.520
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

498
00:21:19.521 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 2>that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you've engaged some of your friends</v>

499
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 2>and other students about these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

500
00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:31.051
<v Speaker 2>everyone watching this at this point </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows that so much of what's coming out </v>

501
00:21:31.051 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 2>of the modern left is about feelings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things.</v>

502
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a sense that they understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that young people,</v>

503
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:37.980
<v Speaker 2>at least the ones you're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand like,</v>

504
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 2>what rights are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

505
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we should care about these things,</v>

506
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:48.391
<v Speaker 2>why free speech matters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the second amendment matters and </v>

507
00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:48.391
<v Speaker 2>things of that nature.</v>

508
00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or does it all just sound good to them?</v>

509
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:50.640
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much it.</v>

510
00:21:50.641 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 2>It makes them feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

511
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.790
<v Speaker 2>what they push and makes them feel good </v>
<v Speaker 2>by their emotions.</v>

512
00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>

513
00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I am very scared of lowering the age for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to vote to be 15.</v>

514
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Like that scares me because the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know who are 15 know absolutely </v>

515
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.941
<v Speaker 2>nothing about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I know like the kids from the </v>

516
00:22:11.941 --> 00:22:15.601
<v Speaker 2>march for our lives better than I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>I know their own arguments better than </v>

517
00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:18.571
<v Speaker 2>they know their own arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can argue for them better than </v>

518
00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:20.110
<v Speaker 2>they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I strictly use facts only.</v>

519
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I make an argument with them,</v>

520
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I cannot really know what they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do next.</v>

521
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:26.940
<v Speaker 2>So here's how I'll give you like a 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute or five minute recap.</v>

522
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Basically how I premise the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment argument in America,</v>

523
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.360
<v Speaker 2>we have the right to bear arms in DC </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus Heller that rule that an </v>

524
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 2>individual's right to arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean the militia,</v>

525
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:39.190
<v Speaker 2>the militia clause is different from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

526
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:44.191
<v Speaker 2>right to bear arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that you personally have the </v>

527
00:22:44.191 --> 00:22:44.470
<v Speaker 2>right to arm yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

528
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:47.140
<v Speaker 2>There are about 270 million guns in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

529
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Fifty dollars million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are air fifteens.</v>

530
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>So we look at the guns sets are 33,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>annual gun deaths,</v>

531
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.590
<v Speaker 2>66 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two thirds are suicides.</v>

532
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 2>So leaves us with 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun deaths a.</v>

533
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.360
<v Speaker 2>So we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in addition to put in parentheses,</v>

534
00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference in a homicide and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>

535
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.280
<v Speaker 2>So homicide is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just a killing murders and unlawful </v>

536
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 2>killing and gun stats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them like to perverse this into</v>

537
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.120
<v Speaker 2>skew statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So three percent of all gun deaths are </v>

538
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 2>with rifles.</v>

539
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that three percent,</v>

540
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:21.541
<v Speaker 2>68 percent of those are suicides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one percent of all gun that's are </v>

541
00:23:21.541 --> 00:23:23.320
<v Speaker 2>actual murders are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

542
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actually murders with rifles.</v>

543
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 2>A 80 percent of all gun crime related </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity is with illegal firearms,</v>

544
00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 2>a most schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most shootings or with pistols.</v>

545
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.240
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So march for life was five bullet </v>

546
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:39.240
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is like,</v>

547
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to talk about the CDC and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we should allow the CDC to research.</v>

548
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 2>The issue with that is the CDC has </v>
<v Speaker 2>already proven to skew statistics and,</v>

549
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.470
<v Speaker 2>and to not actually provide good </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

550
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:53.530
<v Speaker 2>What research is it that they want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the CDC used to be able to do </v>

551
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.480
<v Speaker 2>research on gun violence prevention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just figure out what's going on.</v>

552
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.030
<v Speaker 2>But it's been proven time and time again</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they screw their statistics.</v>

553
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 2>So the Fargo and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

554
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:02.680
<v Speaker 2>we're not allowing you to penetrate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>false myth,</v>

555
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:03.660
<v Speaker 2>a myth.</v>

556
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:09.380
<v Speaker 2>So basically they stopped funding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next thing is that they want high </v>

557
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:09.380
<v Speaker 2>capacity magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

558
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.110
<v Speaker 2>there is no distinction there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no difference.</v>

559
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.180
<v Speaker 2>That shows that high capacity magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means,</v>

560
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 2>can do more damage than simply having </v>
<v Speaker 2>more like clips.</v>

561
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:22.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm just having smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having larger clips,</v>

562
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:27.581
<v Speaker 2>but less of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no distinction that actually </v>

563
00:24:27.581 --> 00:24:27.980
<v Speaker 2>does more damage to the next thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to do is band semiauto rifles.</v>

564
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.430
<v Speaker 2>As I've said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only three percent of all gun deaths are</v>

565
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:36.431
<v Speaker 2>with rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So banning them does absolutely nothing </v>

566
00:24:36.431 --> 00:24:38.990
<v Speaker 2>addressing the issue in lowering a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Violence is making sure that we have,</v>

567
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

568
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.770
<v Speaker 2>making sure that we have more people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are armed because there's a direct </v>

569
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:44.770
<v Speaker 2>correlation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not causation,</v>

570
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.030
<v Speaker 2>but correlation that when we increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>farm,</v>

571
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ownership and concealed carry permits in</v>

572
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 2>addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

573
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:55.390
<v Speaker 2>violent crime goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the next thing that I'd like to </v>

574
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:55.390
<v Speaker 2>propose is what about Great Britain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia?</v>

575
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.920
<v Speaker 2>So in Great Britain there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ban on guns and immediately </v>

576
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 2>after violent crime spiked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in addition,</v>

577
00:25:01.461 --> 00:25:06.461
<v Speaker 2>you have armed robberies increased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So violent crime increased immediately </v>

578
00:25:06.461 --> 00:25:10.721
<v Speaker 2>after and burglaries in Great Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 percent of them occur when the </v>

579
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.480
<v Speaker 2>individuals at home versus 13 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US.</v>

580
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.520
<v Speaker 2>So burglars have admitted that they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because they know that the person </v>

581
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.810
<v Speaker 2>will have like the purse or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they won't,</v>

582
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 2>there'll be on arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So violent crime spike.</v>

583
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 2>The next thing is they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

584
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:27.761
<v Speaker 2>Kyla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the Australian gun by </v>

585
00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 2>program?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So already in Australia when the program</v>

586
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 2>was initiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was already statistical zero,</v>

587
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

588
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 2>gun death and public mass public school </v>
<v Speaker 2>shootings.</v>

590
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in addition,</v>

591
00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:39.710
<v Speaker 2>when the buyback gets implemented there </v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

592
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:44.711
<v Speaker 2>we're like the millions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions less guns in Australia than </v>

593
00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:44.900
<v Speaker 2>there were now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the gun buyback grows in,</v>

594
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:47.270
<v Speaker 2>only one third of guns get taken.</v>

595
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.660
<v Speaker 2>And when we saw immediately after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>buyback was that violent crime spiked.</v>

596
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.630
<v Speaker 2>So here's just the basic argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is not been one single occurrence </v>

597
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.660
<v Speaker 2>where gun control gets passed and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

598
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.390
<v Speaker 2>and gun deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no gun homicides actually decreases at a</v>

599
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:06.440
<v Speaker 2>faster rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Australia,</v>

600
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 2>the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the homicide rate was already decreasing</v>

601
00:26:09.741 --> 00:26:14.741
<v Speaker 2>at a really good rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets passed gun control and the rate </v>

602
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.080
<v Speaker 2>stalls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it actually hurt an addition </v>

603
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Speaker 2>immediately after it was passed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent crime rates go up.</v>

604
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:25.900
<v Speaker 2>And the national trend was going down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the gun buyback program was </v>

605
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.590
<v Speaker 2>completely ineffective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did absolutely nothing,</v>

606
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.120
<v Speaker 2>and then it failed on such a huge level </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Australia that implementing it in the</v>

607
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:35.570
<v Speaker 2>US with 270 million guns simply won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

608
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:40.650
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's shift the discussion a little </v>

609
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.401
<v Speaker 2>bit to the NRA because that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other part of this that during the town </v>

610
00:26:42.401 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 2>hall and the subsequent discussions</v>

611
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 1>that it got very confused as to what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NRA actually does.</v>

612
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:54.501
<v Speaker 1>What do they want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are their people who don't like </v>

613
00:26:54.501 --> 00:26:54.501
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they do,</v>

614
00:26:54.501 --> 00:26:54.501
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

615
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so first off,</v>

616
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:58.890
<v Speaker 1>just give me your position on the NRA </v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

617
00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.820
<v Speaker 2>I think the NRA is a fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization that defends the rights,</v>

618
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:08.210
<v Speaker 2>the right to bear arms of individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thing with the NRA is that they really </v>

619
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 2>don't have the money influence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say they do.</v>

620
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:15.230
<v Speaker 2>All they have is the social influence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican senators know that the base </v>

621
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 2>believes in the values that the NRA </v>
<v Speaker 2>promotes and defense.</v>

622
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 2>And they understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they go against the NRA,</v>

623
00:27:20.881 --> 00:27:23.040
<v Speaker 2>they're going against their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituents.</v>

624
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.620
<v Speaker 2>The NRA does not have a big budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really don't.</v>

625
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.920
<v Speaker 2>They're not like this super powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

626
00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:32.610
<v Speaker 2>They directly control senators and </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressmen with their money.</v>

627
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:35.370
<v Speaker 2>They control with their ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the NRA does,</v>

628
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:39.300
<v Speaker 2>which is fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it provides a check from the,</v>

629
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.360
<v Speaker 2>from the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not from the government for defending </v>

630
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.600
<v Speaker 2>our right to bear arms and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>

631
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helped I think with the case with </v>

632
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.691
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's for Chicago that helped </v>
<v Speaker 2>bolster a second amendment rights for </v>

633
00:27:53.731 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

634
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the NRA does just does a great job.</v>

635
00:27:57.001 --> 00:28:00.150
<v Speaker 2>They're NRA Ila program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually the legislative branch</v>

636
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 2>on defending the second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does a fantastic job.</v>

637
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.210
<v Speaker 2>I think right now they're taking a case </v>
<v Speaker 2>against raising the age from 18 to 21.</v>

638
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:10.590
<v Speaker 2>There was right for the shooting of Rick</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott signed into law in Florida,</v>

639
00:28:10.591 --> 00:28:14.610
<v Speaker 2>raising the age to buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a firearm or rifle now.</v>

640
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.200
<v Speaker 2>So before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

641
00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:21.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't buy a handgun if you're </v>

642
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.381
<v Speaker 2>under 21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could buy a rifle because </v>

643
00:28:24.381 --> 00:28:24.381
<v Speaker 2>handguns were used in violent crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether I think that's right or not,</v>

644
00:28:24.381 --> 00:28:26.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a separate discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he raised the age from 18,</v>

645
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.250
<v Speaker 2>21 to buy a rifle and directly the NRA </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

646
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:31.680
<v Speaker 2>this is unconstitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

647
00:28:31.681 --> 00:28:33.420
<v Speaker 2>We put it in the lawsuit just to address</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

648
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Eighteen to 21 age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

649
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.180
<v Speaker 2>there is absolutely no evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>raising the age does absolutely.</v>

650
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does anything to,</v>

651
00:28:40.591 --> 00:28:41.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to lower,</v>

652
00:28:41.461 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun homicide whatsoever.</v>

653
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about the certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of people that think that if we </v>

654
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.341
<v Speaker 1>could just have all of the right laws or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could just manage everything </v>

655
00:28:50.341 --> 00:28:52.060
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything would be fine because he</v>

656
00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:54.340
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take into fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a ball.</v>

657
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.820
<v Speaker 2>All the laws that we need already on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>books as thing,</v>

658
00:28:56.821 --> 00:28:59.740
<v Speaker 2>as the enforcement doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll just make a tangent.</v>

659
00:28:59.741 --> 00:29:04.741
<v Speaker 2>I'll get back to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is utterly hypocritical that </v>

660
00:29:04.741 --> 00:29:05.070
<v Speaker 2>the left hates trump and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's in power,</v>

661
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.100
<v Speaker 2>but then they're saying we have to trust</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cover more.</v>

662
00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:10.800
<v Speaker 2>So if you think the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think trump is literally Hitler,</v>

663
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:14.190
<v Speaker 2>why are you giving away your right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear arms to this tyrannical government?</v>

664
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the question again.</v>

665
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that there's a certain set of </v>

666
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:22.390
<v Speaker 1>people that think if we,</v>

667
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.310
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we already have the,</v>

668
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.670
<v Speaker 2>the laws on the books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

669
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.150
<v Speaker 2>just the enforcement and the enforcement</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what needs to occur.</v>

670
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Like the Lautenberg amendment means that</v>
<v Speaker 2>domain,</v>

671
00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 2>it says that domestic abusers cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a firearm that's already on the </v>

672
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.470
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just needs to be enforced.</v>

673
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.350
<v Speaker 2>There's the issue with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

674
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.790
<v Speaker 2>the nics background check program where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they say we need more time to,</v>

675
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 2>to evaluate and give you back your </v>
<v Speaker 2>background check in order to buy a </v>

676
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 2>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue is the government doesn't need</v>

677
00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 2>more time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just needs more of the records.</v>

678
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 2>So the reason why the Texas oil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting occurred was because I think it</v>

679
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 2>was some military brands where there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone where he,</v>

680
00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.170
<v Speaker 2>he committed a violation and by law they</v>
<v Speaker 2>sh the heat.</v>

681
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.550
<v Speaker 2>They should have transferred that over </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the database and there,</v>

682
00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 2>if we wouldn't have been able to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapon,</v>

683
00:30:03.821 --> 00:30:05.260
<v Speaker 2>but the records weren't transferred.</v>

684
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.630
<v Speaker 2>He was able to buy a weapon and he shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the church.</v>

685
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 2>So the government just needs to get all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the records and do their job.</v>

686
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with red flag laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

687
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.650
<v Speaker 2>and people like to talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a little bit more of the </v>

688
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.690
<v Speaker 2>trickier areas of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but red flag laws basically say that </v>

689
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:26.041
<v Speaker 2>someone can flag you and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>reviewed and then you can get your gun </v>

690
00:30:26.041 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 2>taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people also like.</v>

691
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.180
<v Speaker 2>So the issue with red flag gun laws is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's all about government </v>

692
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.760
<v Speaker 2>enforcement and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

693
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's also the big issue where </v>

694
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.510
<v Speaker 2>people like to talk about mental health </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they say you're mentally ill,</v>

695
00:30:40.511 --> 00:30:42.040
<v Speaker 2>people shouldn't be able to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapon.</v>

696
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:47.550
<v Speaker 2>So I have talked to countless </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals about this and I should ask </v>

697
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Peterson but I forgot to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is how do you determine </v>

698
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.120
<v Speaker 2>when someone is mentally ill enough and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hits the threshold so they cannot have a</v>

699
00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:57.121
<v Speaker 2>weapon and nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in addition to things with the </v>

700
00:30:57.121 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Speaker 2>shooter at my school looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>retroactively,</v>

701
00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:03.481
<v Speaker 2>we can say this kid was mentally insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if a court would </v>

702
00:31:03.481 --> 00:31:06.691
<v Speaker 2>adjudicate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would actually be mentally insane by </v>

703
00:31:06.691 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 2>by law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore taking his gun away.</v>

704
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the inherent problem here.</v>

705
00:31:08.961 --> 00:31:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that you cannot manage all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things?</v>

706
00:31:12.411 --> 00:31:16.520
<v Speaker 1>You can do the best you can to have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensible laws around them and defend our</v>

707
00:31:16.521 --> 00:31:20.330
<v Speaker 1>right to bear arms and all of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure schools are taken care of,</v>

708
00:31:20.331 --> 00:31:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but that generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

709
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a sort of sliding scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>

710
00:31:24.441 --> 00:31:28.010
<v Speaker 1>but also that the people that want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

711
00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll find ways to do bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not the ones that are walking </v>

712
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 1>out and looking at a building and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

713
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.300
<v Speaker 1>oh no guns here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so not going to walk in with a gun.</v>

714
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Criminals will act like criminals no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what,</v>

715
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.430
<v Speaker 2>but the good thing is that our laws are </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

716
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's violent crime or some rate </v>

717
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.580
<v Speaker 2>from the 1998 to 2010 has decreased by </v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent and and pub in schools are </v>

718
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:58.531
<v Speaker 2>safer now than they were 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like school shooting rates are declining</v>

719
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 2>and homicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

720
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Gun homicide rates are declining in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>homicide rates are declining.</v>

721
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:08.610
<v Speaker 2>So we're becoming a more peaceful nation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of that has to do with having </v>

722
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:13.561
<v Speaker 2>more gun owners and to having more </v>
<v Speaker 2>concealed carry permit owners because </v>

723
00:32:13.561 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when when there's a shooting,</v>

724
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.280
<v Speaker 2>those people are the first responders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's wrong to say that.</v>

725
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh well we'll just let the police arrive</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the crime has been committed.</v>

726
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:29.581
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need people there immediately to </v>

727
00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:31.321
<v Speaker 2>stop the shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm all for having teachers </v>

728
00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:32.710
<v Speaker 2>and arm school officers at schools to </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately take down the shooter.</v>

729
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.310
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's shift.</v>

730
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're going to fully get </v>

731
00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:39.370
<v Speaker 1>away from guns here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's shift a little bit.</v>

732
00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like to be a 17 year old </v>

733
00:32:42.371 --> 00:32:45.230
<v Speaker 1>right now that's in the mix of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's now a public person.</v>

734
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

735
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:51.610
<v Speaker 1>To just be part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this oddly unique time where it feels </v>

736
00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:56.441
<v Speaker 1>like the adults have lost the plot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be very hard for you to find</v>

737
00:32:56.481 --> 00:33:01.481
<v Speaker 1>people that kind of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've been able to find a </v>

738
00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:04.601
<v Speaker 1>couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just to be 17 in this very odd </v>

739
00:33:04.601 --> 00:33:06.780
<v Speaker 1>political cultural time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

740
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Like what does it feel unique to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you haven't lived through this </v>

741
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:13.960
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like</v>

742
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.540
<v Speaker 2>they don't know how to judge it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I know is that I'm an adult now and </v>

743
00:33:19.661 --> 00:33:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I have to act like an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether whether I'm 17 or 18,</v>

744
00:33:23.111 --> 00:33:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I have committed like commitments that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

745
00:33:24.911 --> 00:33:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I have to go through with them and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

746
00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.630
<v Speaker 2>My immaturity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was forced to become mature.</v>

747
00:33:28.631 --> 00:33:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I can no longer play video games </v>
<v Speaker 2>and waste time.</v>

748
00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:36.450
<v Speaker 2>There's things that I have to do but </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just been so blessed to find a </v>

749
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:39.400
<v Speaker 2>solid group of people who actually care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about me and want the best for me.</v>

750
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Ben and Charlie Guy,</v>

751
00:33:42.281 --> 00:33:47.281
<v Speaker 2>Benson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who have just reached out to me </v>

752
00:33:47.281 --> 00:33:48.040
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just selflessly helped me </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate this political minefield.</v>

753
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:53.430
<v Speaker 2>But it's crazy [inaudible] like all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I looked up to like two </v>

754
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.760
<v Speaker 2>years ago and like watch their videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not gonna snack,</v>

755
00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:56.950
<v Speaker 2>trying to like boost your ego here.</v>

756
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.480
<v Speaker 2>But I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would watch her show,</v>

757
00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.110
<v Speaker 2>please continue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

758
00:34:02.111 --> 00:34:05.320
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome that now I can reach out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their expertise.</v>

759
00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.810
<v Speaker 2>The thing with me is that I always like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to start with,</v>

760
00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:12.811
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything and I'm always </v>

761
00:34:12.811 --> 00:34:12.811
<v Speaker 2>looking to get more information to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

762
00:34:12.811 --> 00:34:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Like today I had a call with a gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>expert.</v>

763
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the way here and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what more can I learn in order to be </v>

764
00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.530
<v Speaker 2>like fully fluent and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and knowledgeable about the subject that</v>

765
00:34:23.531 --> 00:34:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about and there are a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff that I don't know about and I'm</v>

766
00:34:26.801 --> 00:34:27.940
<v Speaker 2>constantly trying to learn.</v>

767
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:31.030
<v Speaker 1>So when you see a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again I don't like making this about</v>

768
00:34:31.031 --> 00:34:36.031
<v Speaker 1>people rather than ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you see a guy like David Hogg </v>

769
00:34:36.031 --> 00:34:39.991
<v Speaker 1>out there and he clearly is taking just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the progressive line on this and he </v>

770
00:34:39.991 --> 00:34:43.891
<v Speaker 1>seems more to me to be sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive activists than sort of a,</v>

771
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.060
<v Speaker 1>a fair arbiter of what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

772
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:53.170
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta be frustrating for you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so public about this.</v>

773
00:34:53.171 --> 00:34:58.171
<v Speaker 1>I suppose so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that you obviously probably </v>

774
00:34:58.171 --> 00:35:00.210
<v Speaker 1>disagree with him on on 100 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the policy parts.</v>

775
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:00.990
<v Speaker 1>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

776
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make it about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal part,</v>

777
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:07.890
<v Speaker 1>but that he's thought of as sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>media hero and you're kind of the black </v>

778
00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:09.940
<v Speaker 1>sheep of this group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe not to the,</v>

779
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.010
<v Speaker 1>to the Shapiros and me and whoever else.</v>

780
00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's what I say.</v>

781
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.810
<v Speaker 2>There is no issue that kids are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

782
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:22.140
<v Speaker 2>The issue is is that when someone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>spouting policy that they are no longer </v>

783
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.641
<v Speaker 2>a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are pushing policy and they should </v>

784
00:35:26.641 --> 00:35:26.641
<v Speaker 2>be treated as every adult does such when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say something outrageous,</v>

785
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 2>you should be called out on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember there's a segment with you.</v>

786
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.270
<v Speaker 2>It was on cnn where he said something </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely outlandish a and there was no</v>

787
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.560
<v Speaker 2>blowback Solo.</v>

788
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was that the line Marco Rubio</v>

789
00:35:37.801 --> 00:35:39.170
<v Speaker 1>wants to kill kids or something.</v>

790
00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

791
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.840
<v Speaker 2>So what I say is when I'm pushing policy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say thanks to the police,</v>

792
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.930
<v Speaker 2>like tell me that I'm saying something </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid and pushed me back on that.</v>

793
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.020
<v Speaker 2>The thing is with me that look when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>on TV,</v>

794
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking as a child and pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy,</v>

795
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.880
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I expect there to be pushed back.</v>

796
00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can say whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want like and in addition,</v>

797
00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I think that having debate is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I love,</v>

798
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I love going on piers Morgan and having </v>
<v Speaker 2>a debate with that was great and I think</v>

799
00:36:07.721 --> 00:36:10.690
<v Speaker 2>we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate this thing where like we're,</v>

800
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:15.750
<v Speaker 2>we're one second you're spouting policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you rushed back to the Dust </v>

801
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Shield of Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a child,</v>

802
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.140
<v Speaker 2>but we have to take my opinion seriously</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the second I said I'm an adult,</v>

803
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.850
<v Speaker 2>so just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this isn't,</v>

804
00:36:21.851 --> 00:36:23.980
<v Speaker 2>this isn't fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I saw,</v>

805
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the reasons why I grew to</v>
<v Speaker 2>such publicity was because I was saying </v>

806
00:36:31.241 --> 00:36:32.980
<v Speaker 2>the things that adults weren't able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

807
00:36:32.981 --> 00:36:37.981
<v Speaker 2>Like I was able to say things that Ben </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shapiro or you or Charlie Kirk or the </v>

808
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:41.560
<v Speaker 2>right wasn't able to say because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid and I don't think that's fair.</v>

809
00:36:41.561 --> 00:36:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>spouting policy,</v>

810
00:36:43.361 --> 00:36:45.400
<v Speaker 2>you are no longer a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an adult,</v>

811
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of what's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right generally because you ran the </v>

812
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:55.231
<v Speaker 1>turning point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the high school event that I </v>

813
00:36:55.231 --> 00:36:55.231
<v Speaker 1>did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done so many scholarships on you.</v>

814
00:36:55.231 --> 00:36:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you did the high school leadership </v>

815
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.441
<v Speaker 1>summit in DC and I spoke there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a couple of months ago and you </v>

816
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:03.270
<v Speaker 1>had a great lineup of speakers and Peter</v>
<v Speaker 1>till is there and you had big,</v>

817
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.590
<v Speaker 1>big time politicians and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and first off,</v>

818
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the first time we met </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

819
00:37:07.301 --> 00:37:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just debate about abortion.</v>

820
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

821
00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:13.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

822
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

823
00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 1>you ran this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

824
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:16.600
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still in high school,</v>

825
00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:21.601
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk a little bit about </v>

826
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:21.601
<v Speaker 1>where you want to go to college and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

827
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:22.960
<v Speaker 1>but you ran an incredible event with </v>
<v Speaker 1>major prime time people and,</v>

828
00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:28.050
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was jam packed and it was a diverse </v>

829
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:28.210
<v Speaker 1>in terms of ideas.</v>

830
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.610
<v Speaker 1>So we get into a private debate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion,</v>

831
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.100
<v Speaker 1>but you brought me there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

832
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.840
<v Speaker 1>and I went up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

833
00:37:34.841 --> 00:37:39.841
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went up there and I talked about my </v>

834
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:40.600
<v Speaker 1>differences with this group I talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and the kids were respectful and I</v>

835
00:37:40.601 --> 00:37:45.601
<v Speaker 1>talked about gay marriage and abortion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and death penalty in a couple of other </v>

836
00:37:45.601 --> 00:37:47.230
<v Speaker 1>things that generally these young </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are not for.</v>

837
00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I think gay marriage there pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

838
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I hope that the ship has sailed on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one actually.</v>

839
00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I got a huge ovation on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

840
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is just clear to me that there </v>

841
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.371
<v Speaker 1>has been a realignment on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there is exactly what you're </v>

842
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:02.440
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

843
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Can we just say that Lindsey Graham?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two point.</v>

844
00:38:05.421 --> 00:38:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh is fantastic.</v>

845
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:06.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy.</v>

846
00:38:06.711 --> 00:38:07.970
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

847
00:38:07.971 --> 00:38:12.971
<v Speaker 1>just that one thing with the tie the </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily caller.</v>

848
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

849
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:18.760
<v Speaker 2>So I think the rightest finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing that youth,</v>

850
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like energizing the youth and </v>

851
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.940
<v Speaker 2>instilling the next future of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative leaders is extremely </v>

852
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.731
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we saw that with the high school </v>

853
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:31.400
<v Speaker 2>leadership summit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had some of the biggest names speak </v>

854
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.430
<v Speaker 2>like Nikki Haley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's advice we'd like turning jeff </v>

855
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:38.140
<v Speaker 2>sessions we had so people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every week we had Mark Meadows.</v>

856
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 2>We had Steve scully's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

857
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:43.360
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had prager u and it was just,</v>

858
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:48.361
<v Speaker 2>it was fantastic to see the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just understand that these are the </v>

859
00:38:48.361 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 2>leaders of tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's inform them,</v>

860
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.800
<v Speaker 2>but in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning point is such a great </v>

861
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:55.800
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's free speech,</v>

862
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.630
<v Speaker 2>free markets and capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the three legs.</v>

863
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what we saw with turning point is </v>

864
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.901
<v Speaker 2>such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a great organization because </v>

865
00:39:06.901 --> 00:39:08.671
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we brought people who I have </v>

866
00:39:08.671 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 2>disagreements with to speak there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Cuban spoke,</v>

867
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:14.870
<v Speaker 2>got a couple standing ovations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a debate with Charlie and people </v>

868
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.170
<v Speaker 2>loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're all open having free discussion</v>

869
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:18.520
<v Speaker 2>and debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're,</v>

870
00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:23.521
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're working on sassal shooting action </v>

871
00:39:23.521 --> 00:39:23.521
<v Speaker 2>summit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>December 19,</v>

872
00:39:23.521 --> 00:39:23.521
<v Speaker 2>20 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shameless plug.</v>

873
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 2>And we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're looking like how can we get the </v>

874
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:31.501
<v Speaker 2>most diverse group of people to speak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm thinking about something from </v>

875
00:39:31.501 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual dark web to speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

876
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great if we can get Alan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dershowitz just how can we get diversity</v>

877
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:36.400
<v Speaker 2>of thought?</v>

878
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:40.020
<v Speaker 1>So why is it that these new right or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

879
00:39:40.021 --> 00:39:43.800
<v Speaker 1>young conservative group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

880
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that you guys are able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and I see virtually none of this</v>

881
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.100
<v Speaker 2>on your counterparts on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

882
00:39:52.101 --> 00:39:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean the left has organize and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mobilize youth dish right now.</v>

883
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

884
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

885
00:39:55.931 --> 00:40:00.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about diversity of </v>

886
00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:02.101
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where are they bringing a mildly </v>

887
00:40:02.101 --> 00:40:05.611
<v Speaker 1>disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about scary </v>

888
00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:07.321
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about old school liberals </v>

889
00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:09.691
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are they inviting them to just </v>

890
00:40:09.691 --> 00:40:09.691
<v Speaker 1>have an interesting conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

891
00:40:09.691 --> 00:40:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Just so dead set on political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness and saying everything to not</v>

892
00:40:12.251 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 2>offend anyone with the slightest micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro micro aggression that is just.</v>

893
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:21.810
<v Speaker 2>You can't live in that world and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tall like logical liberals like yourself</v>

894
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:23.460
<v Speaker 2>are moving</v>

895
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.520
<v Speaker 1>to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These subtle little injections of </v>

896
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:28.520
<v Speaker 1>pleasantry yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>

897
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Are moving people to the</v>

898
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.910
<v Speaker 2>right and conservatives are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come here,</v>

899
00:40:31.911 --> 00:40:32.600
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>

900
00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:34.430
<v Speaker 2>My political refugees were embracing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

901
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

902
00:40:35.241 --> 00:40:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I hear people will say,</v>

903
00:40:36.651 --> 00:40:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Ruben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives are just using you.</v>

904
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You go to turning point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just using you.</v>

905
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.370
<v Speaker 2>You're not just using Mikael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

906
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

907
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.290
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

908
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I've seen is intellectual </v>

909
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.311
<v Speaker 1>flexibility there and it's even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had been in here and we've done </v>

910
00:40:54.311 --> 00:40:55.610
<v Speaker 1>this conversation repeatedly now about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage,</v>

911
00:40:55.611 --> 00:40:59.510
<v Speaker 1>I just firmly believe that as time goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on I can shift him.</v>

912
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something that's sort of </v>

913
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.831
<v Speaker 1>insulting about it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people say that to me because I'm </v>

914
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:05.831
<v Speaker 1>confident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm confident enough in my,</v>

915
00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 2>he's going to take you on abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that like in a few years </v>

916
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 2>you'll be with us on a board</v>

917
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:11.800
<v Speaker 1>mean maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

918
00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:13.060
<v Speaker 1>That would be a trade off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

919
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

920
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.600
<v Speaker 1>if ultimately I always described myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as begrudgingly</v>

921
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.770
<v Speaker 2>of of homosexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I don't,</v>

922
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:25.771
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a strong opinion on it </v>

923
00:41:25.771 --> 00:41:25.771
<v Speaker 2>because I haven't thought about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

924
00:41:25.771 --> 00:41:26.790
<v Speaker 2>By his religious standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense,</v>

925
00:41:26.791 --> 00:41:29.760
<v Speaker 2>but from the government standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also makes total sense.</v>

926
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm completely fine with him.</v>

927
00:41:31.631 --> 00:41:33.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious.</v>

928
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I have to respect that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are trying to legislate,</v>

929
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.340
<v Speaker 2>the great thing with the right is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're open to this diversity of thought.</v>

930
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Just say whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about it and let's get to the</v>

931
00:41:43.891 --> 00:41:46.240
<v Speaker 2>right rational viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've,</v>

932
00:41:46.241 --> 00:41:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I've always been about the bait because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it brings people,</v>

933
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.420
<v Speaker 2>it's all about logic and it brings </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to the right end result.</v>

934
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.460
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm on tour with Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a w,</v>

935
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.240
<v Speaker 1>the question that I think both of us get</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked more than anything else is,</v>

936
00:42:02.241 --> 00:42:07.241
<v Speaker 1>what are the best techniques to wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>people up out of this sort of postmodern</v>

937
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

938
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:13.901
<v Speaker 1>progressive group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think as a young person in the midst of </v>

939
00:42:13.901 --> 00:42:17.411
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say are some techniques </v>

940
00:42:17.411 --> 00:42:19.490
<v Speaker 1>you've been able to use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it can't just be about drubbing </v>

941
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.490
<v Speaker 1>them with facts,</v>

942
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

943
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 2>the left is doing a fantastic job with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just craziness and pushing </v>

944
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:26.061
<v Speaker 2>people to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just sort of doing it on </v>

945
00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:26.061
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

946
00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:27.480
<v Speaker 2>well what we saw right now with canyon </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in addition,</v>

947
00:42:27.481 --> 00:42:29.280
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was simply saying,</v>

948
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:30.990
<v Speaker 2>freedom of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of thought.</v>

949
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I support the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our president has to be the freshest,</v>

950
00:42:33.331 --> 00:42:38.331
<v Speaker 2>the flies thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just pushing people to diversity of </v>

951
00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:43.311
<v Speaker 2>thought and freedom of expression to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think whatever you want you shouldn't </v>

952
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:46.041
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be held down by your skin </v>

953
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:47.691
<v Speaker 2>color or your race or your sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like none of this matters.</v>

954
00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.520
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to think what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want and be able to say it without being</v>

955
00:42:53.521 --> 00:42:55.590
<v Speaker 2>tied down by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your identity.</v>

956
00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you make sure that you don't get </v>

957
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:02.771
<v Speaker 1>burned out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think I remember the first </v>

958
00:43:02.771 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 1>communication we ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when either you followed me or I</v>

959
00:43:03.201 --> 00:43:08.201
<v Speaker 1>followed you on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sent you a quick one line note </v>

960
00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:10.841
<v Speaker 1>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't get burned out because I saw </v>

961
00:43:10.841 --> 00:43:10.841
<v Speaker 1>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were in the fight everyday.</v>

962
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.380
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were owning,</v>

963
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.150
<v Speaker 1>owning the libs and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way,</v>

964
00:43:14.151 --> 00:43:19.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that Nikki Haley was at </v>

965
00:43:19.151 --> 00:43:19.151
<v Speaker 1>your summit and she went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she went to to,</v>

966
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:20.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in effect,</v>

967
00:43:20.121 --> 00:43:23.090
<v Speaker 1>what is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of trump people right at this,</v>

968
00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 1>at this event you put on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes there and she says,</v>

969
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make this about just owning the </v>

970
00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:33.041
<v Speaker 1>libs and she got applause for it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit that same point I think the next </v>

971
00:43:33.041 --> 00:43:35.870
<v Speaker 1>day because I think if you guys do </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you just laid out,</v>

972
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:39.020
<v Speaker 1>just kind of stand there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be cool and be decent.</v>

973
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.710
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will welcome a lot of them.</v>

974
00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

975
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.090
<v Speaker 2>I honestly believe that decency wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we just take a second and that Nikki</v>

976
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Haley is fantastic and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

977
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I kind of cried for like a week ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>

978
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that this is perhaps a</v>
<v Speaker 1>paving the road for her running at some </v>

979
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>

980
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many 40 chests,</v>

981
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:59.410
<v Speaker 2>like theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know I just,</v>

982
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.920
<v Speaker 2>I know that she's just been doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic job and she's just one of the </v>

983
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:04.930
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Nikki Haley.</v>

984
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty 24.</v>

985
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'd probably have to be press </v>

986
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:11.180
<v Speaker 1>secretary at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

987
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.780
<v Speaker 1>that would work for like one horrific </v>
<v Speaker 1>week and then.</v>

988
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be fine.</v>

989
00:44:13.621 --> 00:44:15.240
<v Speaker 1>I should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

990
00:44:15.241 --> 00:44:20.241
<v Speaker 1>So gimme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gimme some of the techniques when you </v>

991
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:20.241
<v Speaker 1>see that it can't just be about standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>still and,</v>

992
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:23.460
<v Speaker 1>and facts if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a conversation with a young</v>

993
00:44:23.461 --> 00:44:25.740
<v Speaker 1>person that's really just bought into </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>

994
00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.610
<v Speaker 1>what are some of the techniques you </v>
<v Speaker 1>used?</v>

995
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Have you been successful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that you sometimes.</v>

996
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have.</v>

997
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you</v>

998
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.980
<v Speaker 2>have to realize is that is this person </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking cap and open discussion and </v>

999
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 2>actually wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about that.</v>

1000
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Talking a lot these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all right.</v>

1001
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I know it's too much or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or actually wants to develop their point</v>

1002
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 2>of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they do,</v>

1003
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.200
<v Speaker 2>you have to treat it with decency and </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and not call them an idiot or </v>

1004
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to treat them like a,</v>

1005
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 2>like a good human being should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1006
00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:00.020
<v Speaker 2>and then just have a rational </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with them and see where </v>

1007
00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.901
<v Speaker 2>they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A and a lot of times I can immediately </v>

1008
00:45:02.901 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 2>know what they're going to respond to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just straight off the bat,</v>

1009
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I know what they're gonna respond to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hit them with,</v>

1010
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 2>with an initial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what you're gonna say,</v>

1011
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:10.170
<v Speaker 2>here's the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're just shocked.</v>

1012
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.850
<v Speaker 2>But then do you get them around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean do,</v>

1013
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 2>do you find because it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like sort of deprogramming somebody</v>

1014
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:18.300
<v Speaker 2>out of this and I've had some success at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1015
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them have watched my show </v>

1016
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:23.300
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1017
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I first heard speaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids would come up to me in school and </v>

1018
00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:26.391
<v Speaker 2>two things they would say it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyla,</v>

1019
00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1020
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 2>so the thing about school is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1021
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't get stare downs and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>people would like try to beat me up so </v>

1022
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:33.920
<v Speaker 2>people would like send me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey kyle,</v>

1023
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.580
<v Speaker 2>watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so trying to beat you up.</v>

1024
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right man,</v>

1025
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:37.370
<v Speaker 2>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1026
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people would give me stare downs and</v>

1027
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:44.871
<v Speaker 2>there was such villainization of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative being second amendment </v>

1028
00:45:44.871 --> 00:45:48.501
<v Speaker 2>supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I spoke up I kind of opened the </v>

1029
00:45:48.501 --> 00:45:48.501
<v Speaker 2>crack for people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1030
00:45:48.501 --> 00:45:52.101
<v Speaker 2>I agree with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would walk up to me and like </v>

1031
00:45:52.101 --> 00:45:52.101
<v Speaker 2>caught up like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyle,</v>

1032
00:45:52.101 --> 00:45:52.101
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much for doing.</v>

1033
00:45:52.101 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm just scared to speak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in addition people say,</v>

1034
00:45:55.050 --> 00:46:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was pro gun control and you </v>

1035
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.601
<v Speaker 2>spoke and I listened to you and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did some more research and I agree with </v>

1036
00:46:02.601 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was great to see it.</v>

1037
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:04.580
<v Speaker 2>And like that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all I'm here for.</v>

1038
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 2>So to have people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1039
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.070
<v Speaker 2>understand conservatism and understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the second amendment,</v>

1040
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:14.430
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be pretty weird that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are still in high school,</v>

1041
00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:19.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now you're your celebrities in the </v>

1042
00:46:19.431 --> 00:46:21.681
<v Speaker 2>most strange sense of celebrity you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your role still in high school </v>

1043
00:46:21.681 --> 00:46:23.640
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that like?</v>

1044
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:28.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day we have to </v>

1045
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:29.460
<v Speaker 2>remember that we're kids and I will </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain it to you guys.</v>

1046
00:46:29.461 --> 00:46:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Don't think I'm hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1047
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:36.650
<v Speaker 2>when you're on TV and you're spouting </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics during adult but in your </v>

1048
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.820
<v Speaker 2>private life you were a kid and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot forget that.</v>

1049
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 2>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1050
00:46:40.471 --> 00:46:45.471
<v Speaker 2>when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kid on the left does something </v>

1051
00:46:45.471 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's at the end day,</v>

1052
00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:48.360
<v Speaker 2>they're a kid and we have to address it </v>
<v Speaker 2>as such,</v>

1053
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1054
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:55.851
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a crazy world when and I </v>

1055
00:46:55.851 --> 00:46:58.311
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God I found a solid group of </v>

1056
00:46:58.311 --> 00:46:58.311
<v Speaker 2>people who want the best for me that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can reach out,</v>

1057
00:46:58.311 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not for policy,</v>

1058
00:46:58.921 --> 00:47:01.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like personal advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1059
00:47:01.191 --> 00:47:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1060
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I asked Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1061
00:47:04.231 --> 00:47:06.930
<v Speaker 2>how do you think I should approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>college apps and some conservative,</v>

1062
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he helped me out and it's just,</v>

1063
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:14.340
<v Speaker 2>it's so great to be able to reach out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and have them,</v>

1064
00:47:14.341 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you advice from like 20 years older</v>

1065
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:21.700
<v Speaker 2>than me and given me that advice that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to go through the,</v>

1066
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 2>what was that great tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're like number one in your class,</v>

1067
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:25.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like number one.</v>

1068
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:27.030
<v Speaker 2>You are number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're correct.</v>

1069
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:28.810
<v Speaker 2>There was some tweet that you had about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1070
00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.820
<v Speaker 2>that awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 1>What was that</v>

1072
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.180
<v Speaker 2>number one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people got so angry,</v>

1074
00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 2>so angry and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to boycott graduation.</v>

1075
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:40.540
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

1076
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 2>More cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

1077
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:44.740
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1078
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next step,</v>

1079
00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 2>what was the reason they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>boycott because I was number one,</v>

1080
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.670
<v Speaker 2>so then the semester updated and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was still number one.</v>

1081
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.560
<v Speaker 2>So I posted another tweet about that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then also blew up and I was like,</v>

1082
00:47:56.561 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get Ben Shapiro to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Data Lash is gonna come.</v>

1083
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.940
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Cox was like,</v>

1084
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:02.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be there.</v>

1085
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Why would they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1086
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:09.810
<v Speaker 1>is that really how sort of polarizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee crazy this has got at a high school </v>

1087
00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:12.430
<v Speaker 1>level that just because they don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're your number one not by,</v>

1088
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.880
<v Speaker 1>by being more deemed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No until your number one out of clearly </v>

1089
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot of hard work and smarts and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1090
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.270
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that there would be certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect for that in some alternative.</v>

1091
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It's sad that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are no longer able to be friends with</v>

1092
00:48:28.201 --> 00:48:33.201
<v Speaker 2>people like it's sad that people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left think so people on the left think </v>

1093
00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:37.790
<v Speaker 2>that you're a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore you're evil and that sad that </v>

1094
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:42.051
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to be friends with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have different political </v>

1095
00:48:42.051 --> 00:48:44.840
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my best friend is a liberal and I </v>

1096
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:44.840
<v Speaker 2>actually brought him to the turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>point event and after it was like,</v>

1097
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyle,</v>

1098
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:47.670
<v Speaker 2>some awesome people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1099
00:48:47.671 --> 00:48:48.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you.</v>

1100
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.060
<v Speaker 2>He still liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an old school.</v>

1101
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.540
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These probably we're getting there.</v>

1102
00:48:54.541 --> 00:48:55.080
<v Speaker 2>You and him both.</v>

1103
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:58.900
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so wait,</v>

1104
00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:01.170
<v Speaker 1>let's talk a little bit about college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

1105
00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:05.180
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a great job in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly now you've got a public profile.</v>

1106
00:49:05.181 --> 00:49:10.181
<v Speaker 1>Grades are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seemingly you could get in to wherever </v>

1107
00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you want to go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1108
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1109
00:49:10.791 --> 00:49:12.670
<v Speaker 1>So do you really think that that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a role in,</v>

1110
00:49:12.671 --> 00:49:14.150
<v Speaker 1>in the schools that you're able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into?</v>

1111
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1112
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:17.050
<v Speaker 2>It's sad to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1113
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.760
<v Speaker 2>but there is a bias against </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>

1114
00:49:18.761 --> 00:49:23.761
<v Speaker 2>especially like the top tier schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right now I'm looking to apply to </v>

1115
00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:26.830
<v Speaker 2>ivy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be great to get into Harvard or </v>

1116
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think a man,</v>

1117
00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:30.190
<v Speaker 2>you'd be the reckoning of those places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think it'd be awesome.</v>

1118
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:35.191
<v Speaker 2>I really think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important to be </v>

1119
00:49:35.191 --> 00:49:35.191
<v Speaker 2>accredited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1120
00:49:35.191 --> 00:49:35.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might,</v>

1121
00:49:35.191 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about Georgetown or Gw to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on the hill.</v>

1122
00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1123
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.270
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I really,</v>

1124
00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:45.271
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know what's next for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't go to college.</v>

1125
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely going to stay with </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning point.</v>

1126
00:49:47.381 --> 00:49:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a great organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still going to be conservative.</v>

1127
00:49:49.601 --> 00:49:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to change to change.</v>

1128
00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.330
<v Speaker 1>People don't go the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1129
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to suddenly grow up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1130
00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1131
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.270
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to the feelings.</v>

1132
00:49:58.271 --> 00:49:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that usually does,</v>

1133
00:49:59.461 --> 00:50:00.670
<v Speaker 1>that won't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.050
<v Speaker 1>But all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you want to go to school,</v>

1135
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you really do think that your,</v>

1136
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 1>your politics could affect I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1137
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 1>what happened with David Hogg Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get into to all,</v>

1138
00:50:10.661 --> 00:50:15.661
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what his grades are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like he didn't get into a whole </v>

1139
00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:15.661
<v Speaker 1>bunch of schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1140
00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:16.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean there've been rumors that he got </v>
<v Speaker 2>into Harvard.</v>

1141
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Northeastern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't surprise me.</v>

1142
00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.100
<v Speaker 2>And what do you want to study?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have any idea?</v>

1144
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.490
<v Speaker 2>It's either business or law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know yet.</v>

1145
00:50:26.491 --> 00:50:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1146
00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always liked business and I think </v>

1147
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 2>law is just absolutely phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really don't know yet.</v>

1148
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1149
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:39.620
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be great to be on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>college campus where everyone is just </v>

1150
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.190
<v Speaker 2>really liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be fun.</v>

1151
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of weird and I guess this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows a little bit about the way the </v>

1152
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.710
<v Speaker 1>college experience is going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a bizarre way,</v>

1153
00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.600
<v Speaker 1>just knowing you from the little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know you,</v>

1154
00:50:49.601 --> 00:50:53.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like in a way it's almost like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to go to college like you.</v>

1155
00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you shouldn't and I think</v>

1156
00:50:55.571 --> 00:50:58.630
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of social reasons that</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody should go and you can,</v>

1157
00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn in all sorts of other ways </v>

1158
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:05.401
<v Speaker 1>that aren't necessarily academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like clearly you've got the </v>

1159
00:51:05.401 --> 00:51:06.040
<v Speaker 1>academic thing down and can keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning that way.</v>

1160
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1161
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.460
<v Speaker 1>it's bizarre that people spend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1162
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:14.490
<v Speaker 1>20 grand a year to go to college when no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing is we're surrounded by a lot </v>

1163
00:51:14.861 --> 00:51:16.060
<v Speaker 1>of great minds is what I'm saying.</v>

1164
00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the issue with colleges that you're </v>

1165
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:21.360
<v Speaker 2>basically paying to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so brainwashed with stupidity and</v>

1166
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.600
<v Speaker 2>that's suck part because there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual,</v>

1167
00:51:22.601 --> 00:51:27.601
<v Speaker 2>like great things to learn in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just not like lesbian dance theory that </v>

1168
00:51:27.601 --> 00:51:31.471
<v Speaker 2>says that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these classes are just useless </v>

1169
00:51:31.471 --> 00:51:31.471
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

1170
00:51:31.471 --> 00:51:33.970
<v Speaker 2>it's just straight up complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupidity.</v>

1171
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:35.440
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the stuff that they're teaching</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1172
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:40.530
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of how this seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a through line through education and </v>

1173
00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean high school education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>college education.</v>

1174
00:51:44.441 --> 00:51:49.441
<v Speaker 1>Clearly the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of this sort of brainwashing </v>

1175
00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:55.140
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always going against people like </v>

1176
00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.730
<v Speaker 1>you and I see you on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take down cnn all the time,</v>

1177
00:51:57.731 --> 00:52:01.120
<v Speaker 1>you take down main street all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People know my thoughts on this.</v>

1178
00:52:01.121 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like I just wish like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these,</v>

1179
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:08.430
<v Speaker 1>we just address that twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just twitter's for fond and we have to </v>

1180
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.430
<v Speaker 1>stop taking twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>associate your bio.</v>

1181
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Your bio is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is not real life.</v>

1182
00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not real life but pete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the weird thing about that is it's </v>

1183
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.920
<v Speaker 1>starting to leak into real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a direct message like a year and a</v>

1184
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.920
<v Speaker 1>half ago or so about how online culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>is becoming mainstream culture and I </v>

1185
00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.320
<v Speaker 1>think that that really is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening here.</v>

1186
00:52:23.321 --> 00:52:28.321
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is not real life but it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to like leak out into </v>

1187
00:52:28.321 --> 00:52:31.801
<v Speaker 1>everyone's conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Fox News and CNN and MSNBC or </v>

1188
00:52:31.801 --> 00:52:32.050
<v Speaker 1>basically trump's twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like twitter is like,</v>

1189
00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:37.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have you seen shows where they </v>

1190
00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.140
<v Speaker 1>basically read random replies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages.</v>

1191
00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like John Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three point seven,</v>

1192
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:40.990
<v Speaker 1>four for this like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1193
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:45.990
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the biggest thing that we're seeing </v>

1194
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:45.990
<v Speaker 2>right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a cultural shift with the youth,</v>

1195
00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:51.120
<v Speaker 2>like memes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>memes have so much power in our lives </v>

1196
00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.120
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memes,</v>

1197
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:57.510
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of memes helped so much for the </v>

1198
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 2>trumps 2016 campaign with it really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1199
00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:03.780
<v Speaker 2>and social media has a huge influence on</v>
<v Speaker 2>our beliefs and our actions and that's </v>

1200
00:53:05.111 --> 00:53:10.111
<v Speaker 2>why it is so scary to see censorship of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives online because that is </v>

1201
00:53:10.111 --> 00:53:15.001
<v Speaker 2>basically like twitter is basically the </v>
<v Speaker 2>new version of you just like yelling </v>

1202
00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:20.220
<v Speaker 2>into a crowd and that's basically like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the main form of everyone's </v>

1203
00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:24.400
<v Speaker 2>communication and shutting that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like heavily restricting,</v>

1204
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:29.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't developed my full opinion on </v>

1205
00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.431
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems as such restricting this </v>

1206
00:53:31.431 --> 00:53:34.041
<v Speaker 2>restricts your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really restricts your First </v>

1207
00:53:34.041 --> 00:53:34.041
<v Speaker 2>Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1208
00:53:34.041 --> 00:53:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the whole issue about whether</v>

1209
00:53:34.341 --> 00:53:36.230
<v Speaker 1>they're publishers or platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm saying this right,</v>

1211
00:53:38.981 --> 00:53:42.210
<v Speaker 2>but I think one of the things is if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain if there or if they're</v>

1212
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:45.400
<v Speaker 2>a published further than like they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of legal liability.</v>

1213
00:53:45.401 --> 00:53:50.401
<v Speaker 2>If they're a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then every everyone should say whatever </v>

1214
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:50.590
<v Speaker 2>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the case,</v>

1215
00:53:50.591 --> 00:53:55.591
<v Speaker 2>so just pick one and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely censoring conservatives.</v>

1216
00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Like I know prager u gets like their </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos demonetize so much and have your </v>

1217
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:02.960
<v Speaker 2>videos got demonetized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably,</v>

1218
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now now it's gotten a little bit </v>

1219
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.501
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our video is just don't go out to </v>

1220
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:10.501
<v Speaker 1>feeds anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on that rhythm.</v>

1221
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that crazy rampage I went on where I </v>

1222
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.820
<v Speaker 1>just started retweeting real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only did it with real people with real</v>

1223
00:54:15.821 --> 00:54:20.821
<v Speaker 1>names saying they'd been unsubscribed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're getting hundreds and </v>

1224
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:23.850
<v Speaker 1>sometimes thousands of retweets and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>tagging youtube and they just ignore me </v>

1225
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:24.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on guys.</v>

1226
00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean you to play the game a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1227
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Both facebook and twitter all have </v>
<v Speaker 1>proven biases.</v>

1228
00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Proven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:35.560
<v Speaker 1>How worried are a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really interesting to me because</v>

1230
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.600
<v Speaker 1>you never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't grow up in a time when there </v>

1231
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.831
<v Speaker 1>was some sort of trustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly trustworthy level of the </v>

1232
00:54:43.831 --> 00:54:45.670
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like CNN was not always this.</v>

1233
00:54:45.671 --> 00:54:47.560
<v Speaker 1>The reason I don't even know if you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1234
00:54:47.561 --> 00:54:52.561
<v Speaker 1>but the the reason I think that so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like me that are older than you </v>

1235
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 1>attack cnn the most is cassina and used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be decent like msnbc saying,</v>

1236
00:54:56.111 --> 00:55:00.610
<v Speaker 1>we lean left Fox and CNN saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

1237
00:55:00.611 --> 00:55:01.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1238
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:04.930
<v Speaker 1>We know exactly what you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I always tax CNN because it's</v>

1239
00:55:04.931 --> 00:55:06.910
<v Speaker 1>like you guys have actually become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst.</v>

1240
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:13.200
<v Speaker 2>The ratings are like the lowest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a block of read CNN.</v>

1241
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's what I think.</v>

1242
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that a lot of young people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like an average Americans do not trust </v>

1243
00:55:22.291 --> 00:55:25.260
<v Speaker 2>the media anymore and they have sought </v>
<v Speaker 2>out individuals instead.</v>

1244
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 2>So they trusted individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they look to you,</v>

1245
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:29.490
<v Speaker 2>they look to Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look to a Guy Benson,</v>

1246
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Kirk for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their news because they trust the </v>

1247
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.790
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

1248
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see a great risk in that too?</v>

1249
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm worried about that.</v>

1250
00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I also put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is with that is that you </v>

1251
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:43.240
<v Speaker 2>have absolute liability for what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1252
00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN can whip something up or you know,</v>

1253
00:55:46.241 --> 00:55:51.241
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when an individual like tweets </v>

1254
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:54.591
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on like they're responsible for </v>

1255
00:55:54.591 --> 00:55:54.591
<v Speaker 2>their actions.</v>

1256
00:55:54.591 --> 00:55:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I've been saying </v>

1257
00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:00.260
<v Speaker 1>lately is that I'm actually in a bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 1>way less interested in politics now than</v>

1258
00:56:00.261 --> 00:56:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I've ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm interested in what,</v>

1259
00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you referenced it a little while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this culture thing.</v>

1260
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does it cultures,</v>

1261
00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.170
<v Speaker 1>politics is downstream from culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1262
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.180
<v Speaker 1>That's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.920
<v Speaker 1>So do you see that really as a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future of all this,</v>

1264
00:56:12.921 --> 00:56:16.850
<v Speaker 1>that it's not going to be about all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the little machinations of politics,</v>

1265
00:56:16.851 --> 00:56:18.550
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to be about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

1266
00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is the strength of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1267
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.560
<v Speaker 1>where you'd argue it's either the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength or the,</v>

1268
00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>the worst</v>

1269
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.770
<v Speaker 2>part of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that's a cultural thing.</v>

1270
00:56:26.771 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily a political thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1271
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are pros and cons to that,</v>

1272
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:37.620
<v Speaker 2>but we just have to play by the rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are set by society and these are </v>

1273
00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:42.031
<v Speaker 2>the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are rules that culture has a </v>

1274
00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 2>massive impact on society and whether I </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it or not,</v>

1275
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 2>that Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kanye speaking out.</v>

1276
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:46.650
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great to be speaking out to</v>

1277
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.660
<v Speaker 2>the First Amendment right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we should be propping up </v>

1278
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 2>opinions by celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>siblings,</v>

1279
00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:57.541
<v Speaker 2>because they're famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to show that you are informed </v>

1280
00:56:57.541 --> 00:57:00.631
<v Speaker 2>on the subject and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't take a political genius </v>

1281
00:57:00.631 --> 00:57:04.321
<v Speaker 2>to say that I believe in our second </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment and our first amendment that </v>

1282
00:57:04.321 --> 00:57:05.440
<v Speaker 2>doesn't take but Taylor swift doing like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 7,000</v>

1283
00:57:05.441 --> 00:57:07.480
<v Speaker 2>page essay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1284
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:12.630
<v Speaker 2>that makes absolutely no sense and </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradicts itself written by like a </v>

1285
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.850
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1286
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.460
<v Speaker 2>a worker on the hill.</v>

1287
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was disappointed in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because I have no particular </v>

1288
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.441
<v Speaker 1>feelings about her when I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't think I could name one </v>

1289
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:28.461
<v Speaker 1>song or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like the fact that she </v>

1290
00:57:28.461 --> 00:57:28.461
<v Speaker 1>stayed out of politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked,</v>

1291
00:57:28.461 --> 00:57:28.461
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1292
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever she's doing or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her handlers are saying to her,</v>

1293
00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:36.801
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she got in on this and it's </v>

1294
00:57:36.801 --> 00:57:39.291
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care which way she was going to </v>

1295
00:57:39.291 --> 00:57:39.291
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

1296
00:57:39.291 --> 00:57:39.291
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not what we need.</v>

1297
00:57:39.291 --> 00:57:39.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1298
00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Taylor swift effect president is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>down Marsha Blackburn love.</v>

1299
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.540
<v Speaker 2>So thanks Taylor swift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1300
00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:48.980
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we saw right now by the left is</v>

1301
00:57:48.981 --> 00:57:53.981
<v Speaker 2>that they are losing their stranglehold </v>
<v Speaker 2>on culture and that is very frightening </v>

1302
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:58.601
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we saw that with Connie and Connie </v>

1303
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:01.031
<v Speaker 2>started speaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave my speech about this and they </v>

1304
00:58:01.031 --> 00:58:02.090
<v Speaker 2>started off with mob tactics that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1305
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional appeal.</v>

1306
00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.740
<v Speaker 2>The TMZ guy was basically begging him </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1307
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please men take,</v>

1308
00:58:06.981 --> 00:58:08.060
<v Speaker 2>take off your hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1309
00:58:08.061 --> 00:58:09.830
<v Speaker 2>It hurts me emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1310
00:58:09.831 --> 00:58:10.710
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my first semester.</v>

1311
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we saw just blatant racism,</v>

1312
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 2>viola character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assassinations and disgusting.</v>

1313
00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.900
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

1314
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.510
<v Speaker 2>How does that fly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't bow down to the mob.</v>

1315
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1316
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:28.160
<v Speaker 2>they're losing their stranglehold on </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

1317
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.590
<v Speaker 2>And whether I like that we are putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much emphasis on cultural icon.</v>

1318
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Those are the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rules say that on twitter,</v>

1319
00:58:37.551 --> 00:58:41.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

1320
00:58:41.331 --> 00:58:43.400
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the reality that we're living in</v>

1321
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:48.490
<v Speaker 2>and we have to understand that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening with Kanye is a real </v>

1322
00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 2>shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for African Americans and </v>

1323
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.520
<v Speaker 2>people who were like in Little Tinos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're basically saying,</v>

1324
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why this controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blackstone have to be Democrats.</v>

1325
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:00.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't own me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1326
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all he sang and he has created such</v>

1327
00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:07.830
<v Speaker 2>like a pivotal moment that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1328
00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:12.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stranglehold doesn't affect me </v>

1329
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:12.940
<v Speaker 2>because I know in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the second you say something like,</v>

1330
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I remember someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro is a nice guy.</v>

1331
00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 2>His career was destroyed.</v>

1332
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Duplass,</v>

1333
00:59:16.621 --> 00:59:19.680
<v Speaker 1>who's a friend of mine who's been on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this show and he had to issue an apology</v>

1334
00:59:19.681 --> 00:59:21.290
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1335
00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 1>oddly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the ID people,</v>

1336
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:26.060
<v Speaker 1>people came to his defense at first </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically saying,</v>

1337
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be allowed to say that.</v>

1338
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then unfortunately he issued and </v>

1339
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially young blacks are saying,</v>

1340
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.951
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look up to Kanye west and the </v>

1341
00:59:36.951 --> 00:59:37.890
<v Speaker 2>millions look up to him and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this individual,</v>

1342
00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 2>why does this individual think this way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even more so he didn't bow down to </v>

1343
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.120
<v Speaker 2>the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fantastic.</v>

1344
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:49.210
<v Speaker 2>And we're seeing a real shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the 38 percent number.</v>

1345
00:59:49.211 --> 00:59:51.150
<v Speaker 2>We're 38 percent African American </v>
<v Speaker 2>approval over trump.</v>

1346
00:59:51.151 --> 00:59:56.151
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I know is that there was a three </v>

1347
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:58.581
<v Speaker 2>percent jump from there was in August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The black approval rating of trump was </v>

1348
00:59:58.581 --> 00:59:59.460
<v Speaker 2>three percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the last latest polls that I know</v>

1349
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.960
<v Speaker 2>month or so ago was 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a big jump in,</v>

1350
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing that so many young African </v>

1351
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Americans are so energized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know turning point is doing a </v>

1352
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.090
<v Speaker 2>black leadership summit like a week in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the White House.</v>

1353
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get just 400 African </v>
<v Speaker 2>American young individuals to be able to</v>

1354
01:00:18.151 --> 01:00:23.151
<v Speaker 2>speak their since table listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to see that the left is losing their</v>

1355
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:27.240
<v Speaker 2>stranglehold on culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is scary for them because that is</v>

1356
01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:29.910
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that they have left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1357
01:00:29.911 --> 01:00:31.800
<v Speaker 2>I got two more for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1358
01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.450
<v Speaker 2>You are you in the prediction game at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>

1359
01:00:33.451 --> 01:00:35.040
<v Speaker 2>What do you think's going to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these midterms?</v>

1360
01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:40.041
<v Speaker 2>We've got coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I've been hearing is that </v>

1361
01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Republicans or lose it in the house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gain in the Senate.</v>

1362
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love how your work has,</v>

1363
01:00:44.951 --> 01:00:46.380
<v Speaker 2>is that we're going to win back the </v>
<v Speaker 2>executive.</v>

1364
01:00:46.381 --> 01:00:51.381
<v Speaker 2>These midterms are confused about but </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks the cabinet effect is real.</v>

1365
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Like this was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the left had to do was sit down,</v>

1366
01:00:58.201 --> 01:00:59.940
<v Speaker 2>be quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be civil plaintiffs to like,</v>

1367
01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:01.050
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1368
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.340
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to allow this.</v>

1369
01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they hit themselves in the foot with</v>

1370
01:01:04.021 --> 01:01:07.520
<v Speaker 2>the club and then there started crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the same thing with Kanye.</v>

1371
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.600
<v Speaker 2>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the cabinet really amped up and </v>

1372
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.770
<v Speaker 2>energized the conservative base and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>more so it finally gave the conservative</v>

1373
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.210
<v Speaker 2>like the conservatives a backbone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Lindsey Graham,</v>

1374
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Lindsey Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two point.</v>

1375
01:01:20.191 --> 01:01:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is this skype in?</v>

1376
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like bill cassidy.</v>

1377
01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:29.050
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the peers of the interesting </v>

1378
01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.711
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women were the most angered by all of </v>

1379
01:01:30.781 --> 01:01:33.060
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before the cabinet in August,</v>

1380
01:01:33.061 --> 01:01:38.061
<v Speaker 2>it was like a 35 point seven percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>approval of trump after it was a 40 </v>

1381
01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:40.731
<v Speaker 2>point seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in August I'm the Democrats at </v>

1382
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:43.530
<v Speaker 2>a 12 point lead over republicans in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>voter doozy.</v>

1383
01:01:43.531 --> 01:01:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Asm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's 64 percent republican,</v>

1384
01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:50.811
<v Speaker 2>65 Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we are neck and neck and they said </v>

1385
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:50.811
<v Speaker 2>it's all thanks to the Democrat.</v>

1386
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my gut.</v>

1387
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're doing predictions </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1388
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I actually think the Republicans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are do well in both the house and the </v>

1389
01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really hope so.</v>

1390
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>But I do think so because I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this mob mentality and watching </v>

1391
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:06.551
<v Speaker 1>these videos of Antifa and Portland and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary saying we can't be civil and </v>

1392
01:02:06.551 --> 01:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Eric holder saying below them and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1393
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stand for due process and civil </v>

1394
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>society and all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing needs to burn it.</v>

1395
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>It kind of sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like that.</v>

1396
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>That set of ideas</v>

1397
01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:27.520
<v Speaker 2>thinks the left just completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>disregards the constitution.</v>

1398
01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.060
<v Speaker 2>The constitution was written and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>

1399
01:02:31.061 --> 01:02:36.061
<v Speaker 2>Bill of rights was forced by anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>federalists to make sure that the </v>

1400
01:02:36.061 --> 01:02:36.460
<v Speaker 2>government cannot become tyrannical and </v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse its power,</v>

1401
01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:41.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's protecting the rights of the </v>

1402
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:41.730
<v Speaker 2>individuals in these rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1403
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Why do we not all agree on them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it wrong to believe nude process?</v>

1404
01:02:45.311 --> 01:02:50.311
<v Speaker 2>Why is it wrong to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that individuals should have </v>

1405
01:02:50.311 --> 01:02:52.480
<v Speaker 2>the right to defend themselves and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>defend against the tyranny of a possible</v>

1406
01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:52.900
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1407
01:02:52.901 --> 01:02:57.901
<v Speaker 2>second man was basically Britain because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the founders had just fought against </v>

1408
01:02:57.901 --> 01:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Great Britain and they had seen how a </v>
<v Speaker 2>turntable government quickly become.</v>

1409
01:02:58.861 --> 01:03:03.861
<v Speaker 2>So one more thing I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing tyrannical government </v>

1410
01:03:03.861 --> 01:03:03.861
<v Speaker 2>stay was they take away the weapons of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the civilians.</v>

1411
01:03:03.861 --> 01:03:05.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw this in China,</v>

1412
01:03:05.771 --> 01:03:08.080
<v Speaker 2>we saw this in in Cambodia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing they do,</v>

1413
01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.800
<v Speaker 2>and the individual right to bear arms is</v>
<v Speaker 2>every individual is not related to the </v>

1414
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.241
<v Speaker 2>militia clause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically saying every </v>

1415
01:03:18.241 --> 01:03:18.860
<v Speaker 2>individual has the right to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and even more so it's.</v>

1416
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.330
<v Speaker 2>It's necessary for the protection of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>free state.</v>

1417
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more for you.</v>

1418
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Hit me with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't play video games as much because </v>

1419
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do for fun,</v>

1420
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fun?</v>

1421
01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I used to sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter.</v>

1422
01:03:32.171 --> 01:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't just tell me twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you have to put it on twitter but</v>

1423
01:03:34.271 --> 01:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>it can't just be twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing for fun?</v>

1424
01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>So with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to play a lot of video games.</v>

1425
01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>What kind of games?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

1426
01:03:40.031 --> 01:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>here's my progression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't said this,</v>

1427
01:03:41.531 --> 01:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>but this is like a scoop tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1428
01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Advent moved to to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a rocket league.</v>

1429
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sockets.</v>

1430
01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Terrible game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's boring.</v>

1431
01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Then it moved to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played overwatch Paladins.</v>

1432
01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:55.720
<v Speaker 2>I played pub g and I played for night </v>
<v Speaker 2>and four nine.</v>

1433
01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:00.190
<v Speaker 2>This was when the shooting occurred and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just stopped dead in my tracks because</v>

1434
01:04:00.191 --> 01:04:05.191
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a waste of time and I see my </v>

1435
01:04:05.191 --> 01:04:07.861
<v Speaker 2>younger brothers who were addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the game and it's just sad to see that </v>

1436
01:04:07.871 --> 01:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>this is the state of our youth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're just completely addicted to</v>

1437
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:11.860
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1438
01:04:11.861 --> 01:04:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if I have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1439
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>They're not saying a phone till they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>

1440
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:18.190
<v Speaker 2>You didn't ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do call me or nine slash 11.</v>

1441
01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.430
<v Speaker 2>No video games or reading a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1442
01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:24.950
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do for fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just told me what you used to do.</v>

1443
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must be having fun somewhere.</v>

1444
01:04:26.811 --> 01:04:31.811
<v Speaker 1>You're having fun sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1445
01:04:32.111 --> 01:04:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man did you're,</v>

1446
01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.570
<v Speaker 1>you are having fun with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some of them,</v>

1447
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the</v>

1448
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 2>remaining friends that I have which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really solid friends on weekends we hang</v>

1449
01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:44.340
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go watch movies and stuff like that.</v>

1450
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:44.930
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1451
01:04:44.931 --> 01:04:49.931
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the greatest things for me for </v>

1452
01:04:49.931 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 2>having funders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just simply talking to like minded kids,</v>

1453
01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:55.071
<v Speaker 2>like young individuals at these turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>point events that we run and it's great </v>

1454
01:04:55.071 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 2>and like meeting with pushing policy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1455
01:04:56.911 --> 01:05:01.911
<v Speaker 2>It's just fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the greatest feelings ever was </v>

1456
01:05:01.911 --> 01:05:02.820
<v Speaker 2>like passing the Stop School Violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>Act and fixing nick's like the stops go.</v>

1457
01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Ransack appropriated funds </v>
<v Speaker 2>$2,000,000,000</v>

1458
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:09.540
<v Speaker 2>in funds for the production of schools </v>
<v Speaker 2>like hardening schools,</v>

1459
01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:14.541
<v Speaker 2>metal detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making better communication between </v>

1460
01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:14.541
<v Speaker 2>law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

1461
01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:14.880
<v Speaker 2>law enforcement teachers and students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>

1462
01:05:14.881 --> 01:05:19.881
<v Speaker 2>there was a clause that said none of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this money will be used for firearm or </v>

1463
01:05:19.881 --> 01:05:22.951
<v Speaker 2>firearm trainings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was like the greatest win for </v>

1464
01:05:22.951 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 2>the left and they still hated the bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like the march for life,</v>

1465
01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:26.500
<v Speaker 2>kids hated it.</v>

1466
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.280
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm really dead set on making </v>

1467
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:32.280
<v Speaker 2>sure that school shootings are a thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the past.</v>

1468
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.830
<v Speaker 2>They never happened again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1469
01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>and you love what you do and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just learning about the second amendment</v>

1470
01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.860
<v Speaker 2>and just like being more knowledgeable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and having these debates and discussions</v>

1471
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:44.100
<v Speaker 2>are just like they really make my day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1472
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it goes without saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1473
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I think you have an absurdly bright </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

1474
01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to run for president or </v>

1475
01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:53.120
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not for,</v>

1476
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:55.380
<v Speaker 2>but you left a little window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1477
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally do navy.</v>

1478
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1479
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.760
<v Speaker 2>for politics and like the hill in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

1480
01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Right now I'm just dead set on going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>

1481
01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:05.020
<v Speaker 2>getting my degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning,</v>

1482
01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.720
<v Speaker 2>staying the political sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1483
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
