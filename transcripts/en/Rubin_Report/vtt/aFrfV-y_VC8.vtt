1
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to talk about the regressive</v>

2
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:08.664
<v Speaker 1>left today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been trying to get away </v>

3
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:11.124
<v Speaker 1>from discussing the regressive left </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately and instead talk about the ideas </v>

4
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>of classical liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe in,</v>

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>but current events keep dragging me </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.763
<v Speaker 1>I see on social media that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the phrase regressive left a bit </v>

7
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>less lately and replacing it with terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>like big tier.</v>

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.203
<v Speaker 1>The control left or the illiberal left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever name you use for this well </v>

9
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>meaning yet painfully misguided set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas is largely irrelevant.</v>

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.133
<v Speaker 1>We needed this phrase to identify this </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards ideology which puts groups </v>

11
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.624
<v Speaker 1>before people and sometimes you need a </v>
<v Speaker 1>label to get people to understand that </v>

12
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the portion of the left,</v>

13
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:48.984
<v Speaker 1>which is no longer progressive meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>for progress but regressive meaning </v>

14
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>going backwards has been identified and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're clearly bringing people to the</v>

15
00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>side of reason.</v>

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.933
<v Speaker 1>All of you who talk about this with </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and family who used the </v>

17
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.594
<v Speaker 1>regressive left Hashtag on twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>share these videos are part of this </v>

18
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>political awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

19
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>It seems like these backwards ideas are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting stronger in some circles,</v>

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

21
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.383
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of us who are liberal and open to </v>

22
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>new ideas are coming together and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>

23
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.433
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wind was a huge rejection of the </v>

24
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>identity politics of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't take my word for that.</v>

25
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:30.174
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders said it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing which can replace the </v>

26
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>regressive descent of the left is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>return to true liberalism or liberalism,</v>

27
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>which defends free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>

28
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism.</v>

29
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>That is for liberty and rights of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and most importantly,</v>

30
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>a liberalism that is one for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty.</v>

31
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.943
<v Speaker 1>I now believe that this regressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology is the biggest threat to </v>

32
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:54.384
<v Speaker 1>freedom in western civilization that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists today with the rise of trump and </v>

33
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>the constant comparisons they make of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to Hitler.</v>

34
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>The left now has the perfect boogeyman </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use to excuse anything.</v>

35
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.013
<v Speaker 1>If your opponent is a vile racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can use violence in any means </v>

36
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>necessary to stop him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The regressive left has already begun.</v>

37
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Using violence is a tactic and I fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's just getting started.</v>

38
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>If you're only now getting up to speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what the regressive left is,</v>

39
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>allow me to recap quickly the regressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

40
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>the liberal left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

41
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.043
<v Speaker 1>is a group of people who place identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually based on immutable </v>

42
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>characteristics in a pecking order of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social importance such as race,</v>

43
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and religion were victim.</v>

44
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Hood is the highest virtue to be had.</v>

45
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.383
<v Speaker 1>This oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics allows groups to compete for </v>

46
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>who is the most oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus the most virtuous.</v>

47
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And if someone isn't as oppressed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

48
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>then you have full authority to oppress </v>
<v Speaker 1>them accordingly.</v>

49
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>So black lives matter can protesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>gain rights.</v>

50
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:58.134
<v Speaker 1>March in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white men can be banned from leading </v>

51
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:01.684
<v Speaker 1>lgbt organizations on college campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prolife women that can be kicked out of </v>

52
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:11.401
<v Speaker 1>women's rights marches and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This backwards ideology which demands we</v>

53
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>judge each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on the content of our character,</v>

54
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>but on the color of our skin or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other baked in trait puts the collective</v>

55
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.824
<v Speaker 1>ahead of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It loves all of its minority groups to </v>

56
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>behave as monoliths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a true individual,</v>

57
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.934
<v Speaker 1>meaning you don't subscribe to the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the group think has attributed to </v>

58
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>you based on those immutable </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics,</v>

59
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.583
<v Speaker 1>you must be cast out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the guests on my show have </v>

60
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>suffered from this backwards backlash.</v>

61
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I on Hirsi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali [inaudible],</v>

62
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.813
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Haider and Ali Rizvi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the felt abandoned by the left </v>

63
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>because they speak out about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems within Islam.</v>

64
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.113
<v Speaker 1>They dare to fight for a more tolerant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more truly progressive Islam in tune </v>

65
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:57.574
<v Speaker 1>with the modern society and basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal values and for that they're </v>

66
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.624
<v Speaker 1>labeled bigots or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern poverty law center even </v>

67
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>labeled Majid as an anti Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremists.</v>

68
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.513
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>madge is a former Islamist who has </v>

69
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:12.034
<v Speaker 1>devoted his life to try to reform Islam </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the inside to try to reconcile his </v>

70
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.464
<v Speaker 1>faith with the modern world fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>gays and atheists and women and any </v>

71
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>other free thinkers living under </v>
<v Speaker 1>theocratic rule.</v>

72
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.923
<v Speaker 1>For this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is called a porch monkey and other </v>

73
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.144
<v Speaker 1>vile names by supposed progressive's </v>
<v Speaker 1>while at the same time he's admired by </v>

74
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.004
<v Speaker 1>many on the right for being outspoken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the absolute height of </v>

75
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>absurdity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it all makes sense.</v>

76
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>When you value groups over individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual must be sacrificed at the</v>

77
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.154
<v Speaker 1>altar of the collective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when any of these people dare speak </v>

78
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.204
<v Speaker 1>out and call for true tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find their tolerance met with </v>

79
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>intolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left gloves,</v>

80
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>diversity and skin color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not diversity in thought.</v>

81
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this regressive ideology isn't just tied</v>

82
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>to Islam at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is Larry Elder,</v>

83
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>a black conservative who has had every </v>
<v Speaker 1>label and smear thrown at him.</v>

84
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.103
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with the previous guests I just </v>

85
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these slurs come from people on the left</v>

86
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.533
<v Speaker 1>who would rather silence and dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>their opponents then actually engage </v>

87
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>them in an honest way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People often ask me which interview I've</v>

88
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:23.854
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's changed my views the most and I </v>

89
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>almost always say that it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time I sat down with Larry Elder.</v>

90
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.913
<v Speaker 1>He challenged my views on systemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism as well as the need for a strong </v>

91
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:34.264
<v Speaker 1>family and was one of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped sell me on why small government </v>

92
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:38.674
<v Speaker 1>is important.</v>

93
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll post the link right down below.</v>

94
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.053
<v Speaker 1>Larry challenged me and I wasn't ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can't say that it was my best </v>

95
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:46.834
<v Speaker 1>moment on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I listened and learned and just as </v>

96
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:50.314
<v Speaker 1>importantly we didn't edit any of it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm looking forward to picking up </v>

97
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>where Larry and I left off and as for </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we left off,</v>

98
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.663
<v Speaker 1>this is where I feel there might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing left for me on the modern </v>

99
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:01.364
<v Speaker 1>American left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all know most of my positions on </v>

100
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>important issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm for free speech,</v>

101
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.374
<v Speaker 1>even for White Supremacist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Spencer to speak and not get </v>

102
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:09.854
<v Speaker 1>punched in the face has happened just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days ago and I'm still a card </v>

103
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>carrying liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

104
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm for gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro choice,</v>

105
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:16.784
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro legalization of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm against the death penalty and the </v>

106
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>list goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time though,</v>

107
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm against this oppression Olympics.</v>

108
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm against safe spaces and trigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>warnings.</v>

109
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.533
<v Speaker 1>I'm against labeling all my opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigots and racists and I'm against d </v>

110
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.194
<v Speaker 1>platforming speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at colleges where ideas are </v>

111
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:33.794
<v Speaker 1>meant to be challenged and debated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also for states' rights for </v>

112
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:37.334
<v Speaker 1>following the constitution and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly for having a limited </v>

113
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:40.694
<v Speaker 1>government that gets out of the way so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can live your life to the </v>

114
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:44.054
<v Speaker 1>fullest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said a few times on the show that </v>

115
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 1>defending my liberal principles has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a conservative position.</v>

116
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.043
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also heard conservatives like </v>

117
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:53.324
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Klavan and Dennis prager say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are conservatives because they </v>

118
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:57.344
<v Speaker 1>really are liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where we might get lost in the </v>

119
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>definition of liberal in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense for his classical liberals.</v>

120
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:03.584
<v Speaker 1>So if you're still confused about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out a video I did a couple of </v>

121
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago called why I'm a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll put a link to it right down below.</v>

122
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.753
<v Speaker 1>The point is that if the issues I care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about most free speech rights of the </v>

123
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:15.464
<v Speaker 1>individual and limited government </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to maximize liberty now have </v>

124
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 1>almost nothing to do with the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

125
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>My position is basically haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>

126
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>but I've watched as my team has gone off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deep end.</v>

127
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.603
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of ideas always gets to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tipping point and I sense that we're </v>

128
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 1>closing in on one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can't reign in this madness on the</v>

129
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.494
<v Speaker 1>left than Donald Trump will be all too </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to show them his authoritarian </v>

130
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:40.934
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both sides are ramping up for a </v>

131
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>showdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems incredibly obvious to me.</v>

132
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 1>So while I absolutely believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new center filled with liberals,</v>

133
00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:49.934
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Libertarians and others is rapidly </v>

134
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:53.084
<v Speaker 1>growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've lost the left and maybe </v>

135
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to end this direct message,</v>

136
00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I now kick this back to you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're liberal,</v>

137
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>is there anything left for you on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left or are you left out?</v>

138
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Is it now the conservative position to </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly be liberal?</v>

139
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.613
<v Speaker 1>Let me know in the comments right down </v>
<v Speaker 1>below and we'll see if there's anything </v>

140
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 1>left to discuss.</v>

141
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a television pundit host of a nationally</v>

142
00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:23.224
<v Speaker 1>syndicated radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now most importantly a returning </v>

143
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:27.790
<v Speaker 1>guests in that very chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry elder.</v>

144
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back to the Ruben report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

145
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.970
<v Speaker 1>thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

146
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:31.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am looking forward to this because I </v>

147
00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:34.774
<v Speaker 1>mentioned at the top of the show that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know that any guests that I've </v>

148
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:37.474
<v Speaker 1>ever had on challenged me directly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as you did and actually managed to </v>

149
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>change some of my feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta feel pretty good for you.</v>

150
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of good feedback from the </v>

151
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:50.260
<v Speaker 1>interview and people compliment me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I said the economist would go to you</v>

152
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:53.590
<v Speaker 1>because you were asking questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike a lot of interviewers,</v>

153
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you really cared about the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

154
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.544
<v Speaker 1>then you responded.</v>

155
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 2>And so I think if we made the interview </v>
<v Speaker 2>so great.</v>

156
00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.963
<v Speaker 2>So for you to sit down with a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think last time we literally </v>

157
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:05.364
<v Speaker 2>didn't know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe we had met for 10 seconds </v>

158
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:07.884
<v Speaker 2>before he sat in the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sit down with the liberal and I </v>

159
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:10.644
<v Speaker 2>think that you were ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I said something about systemic </v>

160
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:14.544
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were ready to pounce and you </v>

161
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

162
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.780
<v Speaker 2>and my guy said to me after we had only </v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing the show for a few months,</v>

163
00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to edit that part out?</v>

164
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:21.864
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a part where you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of catch me in like a a moment </v>

165
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 2>where I don't know and we'll link to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right down below.</v>

166
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I want people to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important.</v>

167
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how hard is it for you to sit down with </v>

168
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 2>liberals generally speaking and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have an honest conversation?</v>

169
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.583
<v Speaker 2>Depends on the liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's an open minded liberal who </v>

170
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:38.740
<v Speaker 2>really cares about what you have to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

171
00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:40.210
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

172
00:09:40.211 --> 00:09:41.850
<v Speaker 2>if it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's somebody who,</v>

173
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>who's already decided what they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided and believe that liberals,</v>

174
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 2>the Conservatives are mean people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rotten people,</v>

175
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 2>cold people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti science people,</v>

176
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 2>they were going to be in for a bumpy </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

177
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.281
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

178
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

179
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.163
<v Speaker 2>I want to just recap a couple of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things we talked about last time for </v>

180
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 2>people that haven't seen it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to all the new stuff.</v>

181
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.323
<v Speaker 2>So real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just tell me a little bit about your </v>

182
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:02.124
<v Speaker 2>political evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you end up here as a </v>

183
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>conservative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

184
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't so much an evolution as it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>

185
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

186
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 2>a series of things that happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People I've met,</v>

187
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 2>books that I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that all together you added up.</v>

188
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 2>And I ended up being a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father was always a republican.</v>

189
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom,</v>

190
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat and so at the kitchen table,</v>

191
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.893
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would fight all the time about </v>

192
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I was younger,</v>

193
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I sided with my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think partially because it was just my</v>

194
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 2>mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I got older,</v>

195
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I began to side with my father much to </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother's a consternation.</v>

196
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 2>So going back that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say 58 years roughly,</v>

197
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

198
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.593
<v Speaker 2>what are the types of things that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad was fighting for as a Republican at </v>

199
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 2>that time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember vividly during,</v>

200
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 2>during a a Watergate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad was defending Richard Nixon,</v>

201
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.523
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was indefensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought would Richard Nixon was </v>

202
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 2>accused of doing with Sabrina suborning </v>
<v Speaker 2>perjury and getting other people to lie,</v>

203
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

204
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 2>was deeply wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad thought it was trivial.</v>

205
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 2>My Dad felt that Richard Nixon had not </v>
<v Speaker 2>done anything to enrich himself,</v>

206
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 2>that national security was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>jeopardize.</v>

207
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.343
<v Speaker 2>Nobody died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you impeach a president over </v>

208
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he was trying to cover up </v>
<v Speaker 2>a break in to the Watergate?</v>

209
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 2>That was my dad's position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom physician of course,</v>

210
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 2>was that Richard Nixon was a crook and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>liar.</v>

211
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.523
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the polls show that most Americans now </v>

212
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:22.404
<v Speaker 2>believe that Richard Nixon should not </v>
<v Speaker 2>have resigned over what he did and feel </v>

213
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Speaker 2>that what Hillary did was far worse and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she did not have to resign.</v>

214
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that say about you?</v>

215
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Sorta how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we've come and where we were,</v>

216
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:33.834
<v Speaker 2>that we're so obsessed with scandal </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and when we know right now </v>

217
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.133
<v Speaker 2>trump's been in office for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we're taping this like five days or </v>

218
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:39.864
<v Speaker 2>something and it's like there is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be massive scandal after </v>

219
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:43.434
<v Speaker 2>massive scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama said just a couple weeks ago that </v>

220
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 2>he's very proud that his administration </v>
<v Speaker 2>got through without a major scandal.</v>

221
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that depends on where you're definitely,</v>

222
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.413
<v Speaker 2>I suspect you disagree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of like a personal scandal </v>

223
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 2>or some real feeling of something or </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing,</v>

224
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you don't see it that way.</v>

225
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I do not see it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your question was,</v>

226
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 2>what does it say about us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are we gone?</v>

227
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says about us is that when it's </v>

228
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:05.674
<v Speaker 2>Republican in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like Richard Nixon that people </v>

229
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:07.924
<v Speaker 2>did not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one level of scrutiny and one </v>

230
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:11.100
<v Speaker 2>level of judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it's,</v>

231
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 2>when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's a Democrat,</v>

232
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.253
<v Speaker 2>somebody like Clinton or like Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole different thing for </v>

233
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Obama to say with a straight face that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've not had a major scandal.</v>

234
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was fast and furious?</v>

235
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.523
<v Speaker 2>What was Hillary's email server?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the denying the nonprofit </v>

236
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 2>applications of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

237
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 2>of conservatives with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the irs a what's,</v>

238
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you can have your doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can keep your doctor.</v>

239
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.443
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Obama reiterated that line after it </v>

240
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:37.174
<v Speaker 2>was obvious from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the rigs that you couldn't </v>

241
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 2>necessarily keep your doctor or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't necessarily keep your plan.</v>

242
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:42.514
<v Speaker 2>So I buy the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't he basically say that the ends </v>

243
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>justify the means?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of what he's saying.</v>

244
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:47.194
<v Speaker 2>Like I had to sell it and we kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew I'm not defending that that </v>

245
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 2>particular leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was sort of his may a cold.</v>

246
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.623
<v Speaker 2>I still think as a scandal for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that you're going to bend the cost </v>

247
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 2>curve down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be no worse off.</v>

248
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.240
<v Speaker 2>They're going to save money and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't save the money.</v>

249
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.223
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you know for well that you can't </v>

250
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 2>keep your doctor if you want to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>your doctor and they say it anyway.</v>

251
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.813
<v Speaker 2>That to me as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a scandal pulling out all the troops </v>

252
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 2>out of Iraq over the advice of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire national security team.</v>

253
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Hilary wanted him to keep a stay behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

254
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.650
<v Speaker 2>His Secretary of defense wanted to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind forest.</v>

255
00:13:18.651 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 2>The CIA director wanted to stay behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the joint chiefs,</v>

256
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.110
<v Speaker 2>wanted to stay behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>force our,</v>

257
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 2>our US ambassador to Iraq advised Obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>against pulling all the troops out.</v>

258
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>He did it anyway and the media gave him </v>
<v Speaker 2>a path for that.</v>

259
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray Odierno,</v>

260
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:33.184
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tiring army general of the joint </v>

261
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:37.660
<v Speaker 2>chiefs said that had the troops not been</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled out,</v>

262
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:38.763
<v Speaker 2>isis could have been dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me is a massive scandal for </v>

263
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 2>which Obama got a pass and still gets a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>

264
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:44.494
<v Speaker 2>So is that one of the situations where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're damned if we do and we're damned </v>

265
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.080
<v Speaker 2>if we don't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that had he stayed at most people,</v>

266
00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:50.914
<v Speaker 2>and I'm guessing you included,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably didn't want us to be there </v>

267
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:52.984
<v Speaker 2>forever having left the way he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were having democratic elections </v>

268
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 2>right before that.</v>

269
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally in the months before we</v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

270
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.350
<v Speaker 2>they were having their first free </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic elections and now,</v>

271
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 2>now it's an absolute disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that just one of those situations?</v>

272
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:07.950
<v Speaker 2>There was no win in a way for him at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

273
00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:08.784
<v Speaker 2>Cause either we're going to occupy them </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever or we're going to pull out and </v>

274
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 2>then some bad stuff's gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what happened.</v>

275
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:13.991
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

276
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 2>now we're talking about kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>merits of the Iraq war and,</v>

277
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:18.430
<v Speaker 2>and whether or not we should have stayed</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not stayed.</v>

278
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:19.264
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's fine.</v>

279
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

280
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.153
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that as long as the American </v>

281
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 2>public does not have the will to stick </v>
<v Speaker 2>it through,</v>

282
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 2>because what George W.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush said was,</v>

283
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.324
<v Speaker 2>we'll leave when a rack can stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as the American people did not </v>

284
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 2>have the will to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't have gone.</v>

285
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm surprised,</v>

286
00:14:35.231 --> 00:14:36.064
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

287
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George W.</v>

288
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.133
<v Speaker 2>Bush and surprising Dick Cheney is </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprised that over the advice of all </v>

289
00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:43.540
<v Speaker 2>the people that I just now mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama pulled all the troops out anyway.</v>

290
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.930
<v Speaker 2>He envisioned a stay behind force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

291
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.130
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that Iraq would be stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

292
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.390
<v Speaker 2>we stayed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

293
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.410
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Germany,</v>

294
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 2>we stayed in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still in South Korea.</v>

295
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a while for doing shirts.</v>

296
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.513
<v Speaker 2>We have 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>troops in Germany now or something like </v>

297
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:57.614
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like that.</v>

298
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 2>It takes a while for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for democracy to take route.</v>

299
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.303
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for us to bail out the way we did </v>

300
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:02.771
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was incredible.</v>

301
00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:03.604
<v Speaker 2>You're responsible and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought jeopardize national </v>

302
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

303
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I am surprised that Obama felt confident</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to walk into the Oval Office,</v>

304
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

305
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 2>and ignore the advice of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

306
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.130
<v Speaker 2>So would your argument be basically that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

307
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.020
<v Speaker 2>these scandals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these issues that you brought up,</v>

308
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.063
<v Speaker 2>basically he got a pass because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media is sort of in on it with the </v>

309
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Democrats?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the basic idea?</v>

310
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For him to say,</v>

311
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 2>as he said many times during press </v>
<v Speaker 2>conferences,</v>

312
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I most proud of the fact that I rescued </v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s economy.</v>

313
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Really the major things that were done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tarp and bailing out the auto companies.</v>

314
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 2>George W.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush had set that into motion.</v>

315
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his stimulus program.</v>

316
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Most economists don't believe it did </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

317
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Obamacare was a brand new entitlement </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped on the back of the,</v>

318
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 2>of job creators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

319
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.213
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and notice how he no longer bragged </v>

320
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 2>about things like a cash for clunkers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cash for clunkers.</v>

321
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

322
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.813
<v Speaker 2>cash for clunkers rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't talk about that anymore </v>

323
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.390
<v Speaker 2>because they were boondoggles they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>not work.</v>

324
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:57.620
<v Speaker 2>The cost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American people,</v>

325
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 2>American taxpayers money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

326
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:00.763
<v Speaker 2>So I know that a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna hear what you said </v>

327
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:05.030
<v Speaker 2>there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

328
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:05.864
<v Speaker 2>And then the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a very 50 50 split </v>

329
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 2>on sort of where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people are at before this.</v>

330
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.960
<v Speaker 2>So let's move to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical stuff,</v>

331
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:12.794
<v Speaker 2>which I think is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are we can get into the real meat </v>

332
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:15.404
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

333
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.453
<v Speaker 2>So racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the issue that more people </v>

334
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:20.750
<v Speaker 2>contacted me about when I was discussing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you than anything else.</v>

335
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And it's where you challenged me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most on systemic racism.</v>

336
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.660
<v Speaker 2>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does any racism exist in America?</v>

337
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Not Systemic racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get to that in a sec,</v>

338
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 2>but what racism is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

339
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:36.680
<v Speaker 2>We live in a country has got 330 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

340
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.100
<v Speaker 2>roughly eight to 10% of them believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Elvis is still alive.</v>

341
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Almost half of them belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've seen elvis a letter,</v>

342
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:44.300
<v Speaker 2>you'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's racism.</v>

343
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.270
<v Speaker 2>There are individuals who don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people because of their race.</v>

344
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 2>No question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are there corporations,</v>

345
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 2>they have a policy of not hiring </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody?</v>

346
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there governmental agencies?</v>

347
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.520
<v Speaker 2>They have a policy of not hiring </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody?</v>

348
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is no.</v>

349
00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:57.854
<v Speaker 2>If you can tell me the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>IBM apple that has a policy of not </v>

350
00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:01.964
<v Speaker 2>hiring black people tell me or brown </v>
<v Speaker 2>people tell me who that company is and </v>

351
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:06.554
<v Speaker 2>we can deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what people mean when they </v>

352
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>talk about institutional racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this were the 50s,</v>

353
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I would know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

354
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:12.614
<v Speaker 2>when there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there was a segregation that was </v>

355
00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>legal segregation in the south where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't marry somebody,</v>

356
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside your race in certain states,</v>

357
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 2>but that is no longer the case right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

358
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.390
<v Speaker 2>The racism that people talk about right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

359
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.973
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is individual stuff where some </v>

360
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 2>individual doesn't like you or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals don't like you.</v>

361
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:31.214
<v Speaker 2>But is it something that is anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>akin to what we experienced in the </v>

362
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 2>fifties and sixties absolutely not.</v>

363
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:41.110
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's insulting to people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fought hard and died in the 50s and</v>

364
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:42.314
<v Speaker 2>the 60s to get us to this point to act </v>
<v Speaker 2>like things are just the same when you </v>

365
00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:49.220
<v Speaker 2>have people like Eric holder's saying as</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did when he was age,</v>

366
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.243
<v Speaker 2>we now have pernicious racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he said was every bit as bad as </v>

367
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 2>the old racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are you talking about?</v>

368
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insulting to me.</v>

369
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.170
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do to defeat that idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

370
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.033
<v Speaker 2>this is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned that in our conversation </v>

371
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:04.740
<v Speaker 2>and it really did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:05.740
<v Speaker 2>you got me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

373
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's systemic racism.</v>

374
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:07.981
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

375
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 2>what companies can I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just asked you for an example.</v>

376
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 2>You got me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I do agree with you.</v>

377
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:14.964
<v Speaker 2>There are racist people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain amount of people that </v>

378
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.020
<v Speaker 2>don't like black people that don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you cause they don't like gays,</v>

379
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:19.883
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

380
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 2>We live in a free country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You allowed to not like people,</v>

381
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe odious and an unpleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're allowed to.</v>

382
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 2>You can't harm them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but correct.</v>

383
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Speaker 2>But what do you do to stop the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about?</v>

384
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:32.394
<v Speaker 2>That things have changed for the better </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that there's a certain amount of </v>

385
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:38.400
<v Speaker 2>people that want that oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that want the impression because it,</v>

386
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.350
<v Speaker 2>it sort of puts them above other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you fight that?</v>

387
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 2>You've been trying to fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for a long time.</v>

388
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you find it.</v>

389
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean org,</v>

390
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.003
<v Speaker 2>this movement called black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked about that a little </v>

391
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:49.830
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

392
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.693
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says bogus and his phone or your </v>

393
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:52.884
<v Speaker 2>movement as the notion that Oj Simpson </v>
<v Speaker 2>is innocence from having killed two </v>

394
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:56.980
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

395
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

396
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.770
<v Speaker 2>most cops simply want to do a good job </v>
<v Speaker 2>and come home.</v>

397
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.403
<v Speaker 2>Most cops frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are more hesitant to pull the trigger </v>

398
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:08.190
<v Speaker 2>against a black suspect than a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspect.</v>

399
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.620
<v Speaker 2>There've been a couple of studies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have shown that recently.</v>

400
00:19:10.621 --> 00:19:11.960
<v Speaker 2>One of them was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

401
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.803
<v Speaker 2>an economist from Harvard named Roland </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fryer and he is apparently the youngest </v>

402
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 2>tenured professor in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard.</v>

403
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:20.803
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's a tenured professor in the </v>

404
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.843
<v Speaker 2>Department of Economics and he did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>study to find out about police </v>

405
00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:26.574
<v Speaker 2>brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He assumed he would find the opposite </v>

406
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.053
<v Speaker 2>and he was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said when he found out that most </v>

407
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:33.140
<v Speaker 2>police officers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

408
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

409
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.613
<v Speaker 2>are more reluctant to use deadly force </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a black suspect than a non black </v>

410
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:38.184
<v Speaker 2>suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason in my opinion is pretty </v>

411
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:40.194
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you shoot a black person and there's </v>

412
00:19:41.821 --> 00:19:44.460
<v Speaker 2>any question whatsoever about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be under the gun,</v>

413
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:46.710
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be po,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly prosecute it,</v>

414
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe lose your pension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe go to jail.</v>

415
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.063
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coughs are definitely afraid of being </v>

416
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:54.150
<v Speaker 2>perceived as engaging in racial </v>
<v Speaker 2>profiling.</v>

417
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:54.984
<v Speaker 2>There was a recent poll that just came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and it turns out 75% of cops say </v>

418
00:19:58.131 --> 00:20:01.350
<v Speaker 2>that they are more reluctant now to </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage with citizens,</v>

419
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

420
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.140
<v Speaker 2>then before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the black lives matter movement.</v>

421
00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the disconnect then when you,</v>

422
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:07.680
<v Speaker 2>when you see these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

423
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.380
<v Speaker 2>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see Atlanta and you see Chicago</v>

424
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:14.280
<v Speaker 2>and you see Ferguson and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>places that are usually under democratic</v>

425
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:16.500
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they usually have democratic mayors.</v>

426
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 2>The group think would tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

427
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Democrats are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are helping black people.</v>

428
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.993
<v Speaker 2>So where is the disconnect coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are not thinking </v>

429
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:27.030
<v Speaker 2>critically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

430
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 2>they're just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

431
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.550
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take Baltimore.</v>

432
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore was run by a black mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got 85% of the vote.</v>

433
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Speaker 2>What kind of politician gets 85% of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote?</v>

434
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.983
<v Speaker 2>I think Kadafi got 105% and the top two </v>
<v Speaker 2>officials running the police department </v>

435
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:45.210
<v Speaker 2>were black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The command staff,</v>

436
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 2>majority black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

437
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 2>all the city council,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>

438
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 2>majority black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state attorney,</v>

439
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 2>the one who brought the charges against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the six officers,</v>

440
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a black female.</v>

441
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.903
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and still they are still talking about </v>

442
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 2>systemic racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

443
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.683
<v Speaker 2>the fact of the matter is a lot of black</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspects or engaging in bad conduct and </v>

444
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 2>the police are doing their job and often</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad conduct is against another black</v>

445
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:08.050
<v Speaker 2>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

446
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Does this all come down to education for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

447
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.433
<v Speaker 2>Because at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can teach people properly about </v>

448
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:15.064
<v Speaker 2>history and if you can teach them </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly about what the role of </v>

449
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:17.854
<v Speaker 2>government is and all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's really how you untie this </v>

450
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:23.050
<v Speaker 2>stuff from just the screeching people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides.</v>

451
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.060
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

452
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 2>And but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also all about,</v>

453
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rationally connect connecting the dots.</v>

454
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Is it really true that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a young black man is more likely to</v>

455
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:37.540
<v Speaker 2>be pulled over by a cop than a young </v>
<v Speaker 2>white man?</v>

456
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it is true,</v>

457
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.040
<v Speaker 2>the other question is why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

458
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.243
<v Speaker 2>and you cannot have a meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion about any of this without </v>

459
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:45.244
<v Speaker 2>talking about behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe the last time we were </v>

460
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:48.850
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about a national institutes of</v>

461
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:50.140
<v Speaker 2>justice study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

462
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 2>that's the research arm of the DOJ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

463
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 2>they did a study that came out in 2013 </v>
<v Speaker 2>called traffic stops and race,</v>

464
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.023
<v Speaker 2>and it turns out that whether you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about driving without a license </v>

465
00:22:01.451 --> 00:22:02.284
<v Speaker 2>or driving while drunk or driving a with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a busted tail pipe or driving without a </v>

466
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:08.320
<v Speaker 2>seatbelt or driving without a car seat </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back,</v>

467
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.473
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out black motorists were more </v>

468
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:11.560
<v Speaker 2>likely to commit those crimes.</v>

469
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Then a white motorist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

470
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:13.804
<v Speaker 2>and the study said that the differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>in stopping have to do with differences </v>

471
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.403
<v Speaker 2>in offending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't have a meaningful </v>

472
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:19.744
<v Speaker 2>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you have a meaningful discussion </v>

473
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:21.574
<v Speaker 2>about behavior right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that some people on the left </v>

474
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:25.060
<v Speaker 2>would hear that and they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

475
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.760
<v Speaker 2>black people have been oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically,</v>

476
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.330
<v Speaker 2>so they are more likely to have a tail </v>
<v Speaker 2>light out or some other thing you,</v>

477
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.173
<v Speaker 2>you would just say that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would just say that individual </v>

478
00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:35.884
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to drive a car that's </v>

479
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.710
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be the one that's on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

480
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:39.544
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more poor white people in the </v>

481
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 2>country than there are poor black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

482
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:42.724
<v Speaker 2>But if black people that complained </v>
<v Speaker 2>about being disproportionately pulled </v>

483
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:45.760
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

484
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.630
<v Speaker 2>half of all the homicides in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country involved black victims,</v>

485
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.810
<v Speaker 2>almost all of the black victims were </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed by other black people.</v>

486
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what Ha,</v>

487
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.770
<v Speaker 2>what that has to do with coffee being </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

488
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.663
<v Speaker 2>It has to do with the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately large percentage of </v>

489
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:03.070
<v Speaker 2>crime is committed by a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A small percentage of people,</v>

490
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.860
<v Speaker 2>usually males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually young black males,</v>

491
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.843
<v Speaker 2>often against their peers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is because of the lack of </v>

492
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:11.260
<v Speaker 2>fathers in the home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say it,</v>

493
00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:12.094
<v Speaker 2>Obama said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A kid raised without a father is five </v>

494
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:15.360
<v Speaker 2>times more likely to be poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

495
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.490
<v Speaker 2>nine times more likely to drop out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>school in 20 times more likely to end up</v>

496
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:19.324
<v Speaker 2>in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number one problem facing this </v>

497
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:22.670
<v Speaker 2>country is not a bad cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

498
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.050
<v Speaker 2>not Obama care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the large number of,</v>

499
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.320
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of children raised without fathers.</v>

500
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.860
<v Speaker 2>That is a product of the welfare state </v>
<v Speaker 2>between 1890 and 1920,</v>

501
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:34.180
<v Speaker 2>1930.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not,</v>

502
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.253
<v Speaker 2>a black kid was slightly more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be born to mothers and fathers married </v>

503
00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 2>to each other than a white kid.</v>

504
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.833
<v Speaker 2>So what's the connection there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the 1920 connections to the </v>

505
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 2>welfare state starts and why does that </v>
<v Speaker 2>harm the black family?</v>

506
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 2>More?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

507
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.230
<v Speaker 2>the welfare state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

508
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 2>really got kicked off in the mid </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>

509
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:56.081
<v Speaker 2>25% of black kids are born outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wedlock in 1960 right now it's 73%.</v>

510
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.523
<v Speaker 2>And what happened is literally Lyndon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson launched a so called war on </v>

511
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:05.171
<v Speaker 2>poverty and he sent a workers literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocking on people's doors to a prize.</v>

512
00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Women of their right to welfare provided</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no man in the house.</v>

513
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Speaker 2>And so what we've done is changed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

514
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.823
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've incentivize women to marry the </v>

515
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:14.564
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've allowed men to abandon their </v>

516
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:16.214
<v Speaker 2>financial and more responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a neutron bomb dropped on this </v>

517
00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

518
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:20.894
<v Speaker 2>all because of the war on poverty that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was done by Lyndon Johnson and the </v>

519
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Democrats and with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the tacit support by Republicans as</v>

520
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:27.584
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

521
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 2>One quick thing and we know what we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is a,</v>

522
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:33.470
<v Speaker 2>that there is a negative incentive </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in 1996,</v>

523
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Speaker 2>when Bill Clinton signed the welfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>reform act of 1996,</v>

524
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 2>welfare declined by over 50%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far steeper than anybody predicted.</v>

525
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:42.404
<v Speaker 2>It turned out there was a bunch of able </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodied people enable minded people </v>

526
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 2>sitting on couches and when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

527
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:47.654
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Jig was up they got off the </v>

528
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:49.970
<v Speaker 2>couch and got it and got to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

529
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the intentions are good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we John and was,</v>

530
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.873
<v Speaker 2>pushes this when the Democrats and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans are going to work where </v>

531
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:57.494
<v Speaker 2>their intentions were going to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get out of my way or is there </v>

532
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.800
<v Speaker 2>really something more nefarious going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

533
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.270
<v Speaker 2>the intentions were quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

534
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

535
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Fdr talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

536
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corrosive effect of,</v>

537
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.990
<v Speaker 2>of government dependency when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>launched the new deal.</v>

538
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

539
00:25:13.251 --> 00:25:14.084
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lyndon Johnson talked about getting </v>

540
00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:16.574
<v Speaker 2>people off of government dependencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and making them more self self </v>

541
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:20.810
<v Speaker 2>sufficient by launching the war on </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty.</v>

542
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Those were their stated goals and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed them.</v>

543
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.513
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but human nature is such that if you </v>

544
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:29.120
<v Speaker 2>allow somebody in easy out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people will take an easy out.</v>

545
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we've done with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

546
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.663
<v Speaker 2>So basically we've said to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>subset of people and it I guess is a </v>

547
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:35.594
<v Speaker 2>disproportionate amount of black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've said you can get a certain amount </v>

548
00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:39.974
<v Speaker 2>of government handouts and basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>your argument is that this is now just </v>

549
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.033
<v Speaker 2>leaving people in the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you can get something </v>

550
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.530
<v Speaker 2>subsidized housing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

551
00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 2>food stamps and you don't have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and you'll just take it,</v>

552
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:55.290
<v Speaker 2>that's not a black characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a characteristic of what else,</v>

553
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 2>what any human of human nature.</v>

554
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.030
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was uh,</v>

555
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a poll taken in 1986 by the La Times.</v>

556
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 2>They asked poor people in non poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>people a bunch of questions.</v>

557
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of them was,</v>

558
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.613
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that that poor people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have additional children to get </v>

559
00:26:09.831 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 2>additional money from welfare?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority of non poor people said no.</v>

560
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:15.170
<v Speaker 2>They probably thought that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulting if not racist.</v>

561
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.140
<v Speaker 2>64% of poor people said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

562
00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 2>they were asked this question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor people,</v>

563
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:22.760
<v Speaker 2>where do you believe that welfare is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>crutch,</v>

564
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.340
<v Speaker 2>a creates dependency or do you believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

565
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.583
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a means to get you to stand on your own </v>

566
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:29.324
<v Speaker 2>two feet and go forward?</v>
<v Speaker 2>More of them said it was a crutch that </v>

567
00:26:31.781 --> 00:26:32.614
<v Speaker 2>created dependency than it was a means </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get you on your own two feet and go </v>

568
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are poor people responding to this</v>

569
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 2>poll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 2>So basically guilt has a lot to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

571
00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.173
<v Speaker 2>The guilt sort of white liberal guilt in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way has actually subjected black </v>

572
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 2>people to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

573
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.753
<v Speaker 2>not all black people of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a certain subset of poor black </v>

574
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:52.860
<v Speaker 2>people to a set of circumstances that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they almost can't get out of.</v>

575
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.053
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also I think part of it is people </v>

576
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:57.414
<v Speaker 2>that are comfortable and wealthy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>well educated look around to figure out </v>

577
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 2>how they can perfect the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

578
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:08.210
<v Speaker 2>and they forget that part of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere is overcoming obstacles and,</v>

579
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.650
<v Speaker 2>and struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

580
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 2>and if you make things real comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people,</v>

581
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.280
<v Speaker 2>some people are going to take the easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>way out.</v>

582
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a kind of mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of mentality.</v>

583
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:17.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did we get to that point where </v>

584
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.040
<v Speaker 2>fighting for what's yours fighting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one should give you anything,</v>

585
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 2>that the government isn't supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you anything and no one should,</v>

586
00:27:25.681 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 2>that it is your life to live.</v>

587
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.103
<v Speaker 2>It is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your job as a human to pursue what </v>

588
00:27:30.271 --> 00:27:31.104
<v Speaker 2>makes you happy and take what you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't mean destroying </v>

589
00:27:33.331 --> 00:27:34.430
<v Speaker 2>everything around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

590
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.300
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but finding what makes you happy.</v>

591
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.390
<v Speaker 2>When did that get crossed up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it all connected to this,</v>

592
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:40.920
<v Speaker 2>do you think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

593
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:41.783
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the founding fathers intended </v>

594
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:47.661
<v Speaker 2>for us to have what people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized as rugged individualism.</v>

595
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Article One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>section eight of the constitution,</v>

596
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.163
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set forth a handful of things that the </v>

597
00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:53.700
<v Speaker 2>federal government should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

598
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 2>they did not include social security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not include Medicare.</v>

599
00:27:56.161 --> 00:27:58.590
<v Speaker 2>They did not include Medicaid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not include charity.</v>

600
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.180
<v Speaker 2>But we've gotten away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

601
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:02.130
<v Speaker 2>because as people become more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>affluent,</v>

602
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.243
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look around and try to perfect the </v>

603
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you roll back all of those things?</v>

604
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you consider yourself a libertarian?</v>

605
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.110
<v Speaker 2>You're basically a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

606
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you wouldn't lay a libertarian small,</v>

607
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:14.574
<v Speaker 2>I'm a law and order a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think there should be driver's </v>

608
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:18.350
<v Speaker 2>licenses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

609
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.141
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

610
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 2>So you're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

611
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:21.024
<v Speaker 2>because that's an important distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make because there are plenty of </v>

612
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 2>libertarians that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

613
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 2>so what makes you not a classical </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal then?</v>

614
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:26.874
<v Speaker 2>Because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is become one of the themes over </v>

615
00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:28.874
<v Speaker 2>the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a classical liberal and the John </v>

616
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Stuart mill sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

617
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:32.843
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am somebody who believes in maximum </v>

618
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:35.964
<v Speaker 2>personal freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also you have to believe in the </v>

619
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:38.543
<v Speaker 2>excellent personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is to deal with the </v>

620
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 2>consequences of your choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

621
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:43.063
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people don't want to do </v>

622
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:44.640
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

623
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 2>they want to show people from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

624
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vestiges of,</v>

625
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

626
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 2>of the world of life.</v>

627
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you do that,</v>

628
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.100
<v Speaker 2>you also will create some other kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction that there'll be worse.</v>

629
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.083
<v Speaker 2>My father used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to get something for </v>

630
00:28:58.351 --> 00:28:59.184
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you often end up getting nothing for </v>

631
00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:01.530
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

632
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 2>So what sort of social safety net should</v>
<v Speaker 2>there be then?</v>

633
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Or do you not think that there should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be?</v>

634
00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:07.074
<v Speaker 2>And this may be the difference between a</v>
<v Speaker 2>small l libertarian and a classical </v>

635
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:10.554
<v Speaker 2>liberal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

636
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I think most classical liberals would </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel the way I feel.</v>

637
00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:16.380
<v Speaker 2>And that is that the safety net should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be provided by other individuals,</v>

638
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 2>not by government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by churches,</v>

639
00:29:18.391 --> 00:29:19.224
<v Speaker 2>nonprofits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I'm Alexis de </v>

640
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Tocqueville wrote about in democracy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

641
00:29:23.821 --> 00:29:24.654
<v Speaker 2>where were all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were called mutual aid societies </v>

642
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Speaker 2>that were set up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before social security,</v>

643
00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:30.810
<v Speaker 2>before Medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before Medicaid.</v>

644
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and believe it or not,</v>

645
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.593
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black person living in Chicago in </v>

646
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.440
<v Speaker 2>1920s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1930s,</v>

647
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.500
<v Speaker 2>was more likely to have health care </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance and a white person because,</v>

648
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:41.483
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he joined these mutual aid societies </v>

649
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:44.343
<v Speaker 2>that provided that.</v>

650
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's circle back to the family stuff</v>

651
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.613
<v Speaker 2>because I remember you said the family </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff last time and the importance of a </v>

652
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 2>two parent family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

653
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:52.384
<v Speaker 2>I come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents were still married 40 some </v>

654
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 2>odd years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went back to my childhood home in</v>

655
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:59.410
<v Speaker 2>New York and for the first time I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

656
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw a little more tangibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you were talking about,</v>

657
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:03.064
<v Speaker 2>to go to my parents' house to feel that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the same place that I grew up in </v>

658
00:30:06.341 --> 00:30:07.174
<v Speaker 2>that same community that I was part of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I visited family friends and some </v>

659
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:11.494
<v Speaker 2>relatives that were nearby and it did </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like it connected me to something </v>

660
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 2>that was important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of an a femoral thing.</v>

661
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's not quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>tangible,</v>

662
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 2>but something that's important that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

663
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 2>It lays your roots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

664
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:25.360
<v Speaker 2>and that you can sort of figure out who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are from that.</v>

665
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Is that really what you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the family?</v>

666
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:28.894
<v Speaker 2>That not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that there's a </v>

667
00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:31.990
<v Speaker 2>breadwinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something else,</v>

668
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:35.680
<v Speaker 2>something that's sort of bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that really can lay out what a life</v>

669
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:37.210
<v Speaker 2>is supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

670
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:40.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a additional check as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out.</v>

671
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.480
<v Speaker 2>It's also being a role model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching your father get up,</v>

672
00:30:43.481 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to work when he doesn't feel like it.</v>

673
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Watching him live up to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities.</v>

674
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.780
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

675
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.280
<v Speaker 2>the three arguably the biggest leaders </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country,</v>

676
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:53.230
<v Speaker 2>black leaders in this country or Jesse </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson,</v>

677
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them had difficult not for you,</v>

678
00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.373
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them had difficult if not </v>

679
00:31:00.551 --> 00:31:02.440
<v Speaker 2>nonexistent relationship with their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>fathers.</v>

680
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Jesse Jackson's mother was a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

681
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.200
<v Speaker 2>who was impregnated by the married man </v>
<v Speaker 2>who lived next door.</v>

682
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.540
<v Speaker 2>And when Jesse Jackson was raised in </v>
<v Speaker 2>South Carolina,</v>

683
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:11.500
<v Speaker 2>kits taunted him.</v>

684
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:12.543
<v Speaker 2>Jesse ain't got no daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesse ain't got no daddy because that's </v>

685
00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:17.170
<v Speaker 2>how rare it was in those days to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised without a father.</v>

686
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.843
<v Speaker 2>Al Sharpton had a nice middle class life</v>
<v Speaker 2>until his father abandoned the family </v>

687
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.490
<v Speaker 2>and then down to the ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of Farah Khan,</v>

688
00:31:24.491 --> 00:31:27.220
<v Speaker 2>his mom was a strange from her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a boyfriend,</v>

689
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 2>took back up with the husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got pregnant,</v>

690
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:31.240
<v Speaker 2>didn't want the boyfriend to know and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to abort,</v>

691
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis Farrakhan with a coat hanger.</v>

692
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.203
<v Speaker 2>So all three of these men in my opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>have deep psychological issues because </v>

693
00:31:36.911 --> 00:31:38.680
<v Speaker 2>of the lack of relationship with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own fathers.</v>

694
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.690
<v Speaker 2>And that is one of the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

695
00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:41.524
<v Speaker 2>they're so angry despite the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>things have gotten so much better in </v>

696
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:44.584
<v Speaker 2>terms of race relations in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically they can't let go of that </v>

697
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:47.861
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

698
00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:51.220
<v Speaker 2>not to fully cycle analyze them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're dealing with a personal pain</v>

699
00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:54.190
<v Speaker 2>that is extremely painful for sure.</v>

700
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:55.263
<v Speaker 2>And they can't let go of that pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now they're kind of projecting it on </v>

701
00:31:58.051 --> 00:32:00.670
<v Speaker 2>to the rest of us via policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>

702
00:32:00.671 --> 00:32:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a psychologist if I were,</v>

703
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:03.980
<v Speaker 2>that's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

704
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.330
<v Speaker 2>now a lot of people have had bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances and have not been that,</v>

705
00:32:07.331 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sour because of it.</v>

706
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:10.870
<v Speaker 2>My father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we talked about him before.</v>

707
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 2>My father does not know who his </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological father is.</v>

708
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.120
<v Speaker 2>The man named elder was a man who was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his life the longest.</v>

709
00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 2>He was a alcoholic who abused him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>abused,</v>

710
00:32:18.821 --> 00:32:19.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

711
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.160
<v Speaker 2>his mother physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

712
00:32:21.161 --> 00:32:21.994
<v Speaker 2>and my dad was literally thrown out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the house when he was 13 years old by </v>

713
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:27.340
<v Speaker 2>his mother's then boyfriend who sided </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

714
00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:28.121
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

715
00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:28.954
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her boyfriend when he and my dad got </v>

716
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:34.420
<v Speaker 2>into a corner when he was 13 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came home from chemo from school,</v>

717
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 2>and he was making too much noise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend.</v>

718
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Got Mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad said something to him,</v>

719
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mother's side with the boyfriend out</v>

720
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 2>of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

721
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 years old,</v>

722
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Jim Crow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>south Athens,</v>

723
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:43.964
<v Speaker 2>Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the beginning of the Great </v>

724
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.183
<v Speaker 2>Depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father was never angry though my </v>

725
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:49.930
<v Speaker 2>father said to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always us,</v>

726
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 2>meaning my two brothers and me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I picked up the cars.</v>

727
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I dealt with them to the best that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

728
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did he do?</v>

729
00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Did you do a series of whatever anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>would pay him to do a cleaning?</v>

730
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 2>This cleaning that ultimately he got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job with the pullman porters.</v>

731
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 2>They were the largest private employer </v>
<v Speaker 2>of blacks in those days,</v>

732
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.520
<v Speaker 2>and he was able to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>travel around the country.</v>

733
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:13.220
<v Speaker 2>That's how we ended up in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came here one time,</v>

734
00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 2>it was sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people smiled,</v>

735
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.800
<v Speaker 2>it seemed more friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after the war was over at my dad,</v>

736
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I relocated to California to try and get</v>

737
00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:21.860
<v Speaker 2>a job as a cook.</v>

738
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.920
<v Speaker 2>And he was told that he had no </v>
<v Speaker 2>references,</v>

739
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.500
<v Speaker 2>which was California's way of saying we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't hire black people.</v>

740
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

741
00:33:28.581 --> 00:33:29.414
<v Speaker 2>and my dad ended up being a janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked two full time jobs at the </v>

742
00:33:31.521 --> 00:33:34.100
<v Speaker 2>janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save these nickels and dimes,</v>

743
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.740
<v Speaker 2>started a little cafe near the Pico </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union area,</v>

744
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:38.420
<v Speaker 2>which he ran until the 80s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

745
00:33:38.421 --> 00:33:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about this in my last book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Dear Father,</v>

746
00:33:40.671 --> 00:33:41.504
<v Speaker 2>dear son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two lives eight hours because my father </v>

747
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:44.650
<v Speaker 2>and I did not get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

748
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I thought of my father is grouchy and an</v>
<v Speaker 2>honoree and I couldn't understand why he</v>

749
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:51.950
<v Speaker 2>was so ill tempered until I got 25 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

750
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 2>We stopped talking to each other when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was 15 we didn't speak to each other for</v>

751
00:33:55.581 --> 00:33:56.414
<v Speaker 2>10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

752
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.823
<v Speaker 2>And my dad and I sat down for what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought would be a 10 minute </v>

753
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:00.074
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ended up being an eight hour </v>

754
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:03.320
<v Speaker 2>conversation and that's why I wrote the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book a dear father,</v>

755
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:04.370
<v Speaker 2>dear son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two lives,</v>

756
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 2>eight hours about this conversation.</v>

757
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that despite what you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about,</v>

758
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Obama,</v>

759
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 2>do you think that now that he's out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

760
00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:16.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe he could step into the role that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to see him in?</v>

761
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 2>So instead of America turning to Jesse </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson and Farrakhan and Sharpton,</v>

762
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe they can turn it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if not to Larry elder,</v>

763
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:25.663
<v Speaker 2>but if not to Larry elder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that may be Obama when you disconnected </v>

764
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:29.534
<v Speaker 2>from politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can actually talk about some of those </v>

765
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:32.421
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I mean,</v>

766
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:33.254
<v Speaker 2>you addressed it a second ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said he did mention the family and </v>

767
00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:35.984
<v Speaker 2>mentioned fathers and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is there a chance that you think </v>

768
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:39.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a chance for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not optimistic because,</v>

769
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his last press conference he talked </v>

770
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:44.930
<v Speaker 2>about we still have a great deal to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>on race.</v>

771
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.793
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people talk about a great deal to </v>

772
00:34:46.671 --> 00:34:49.820
<v Speaker 2>do on race or all they really mean is </v>
<v Speaker 2>how black people feel about white people</v>

773
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:50.654
<v Speaker 2>and vice versa.</v>

774
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.090
<v Speaker 2>They don't care about Hispanic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care about Asians.</v>

775
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 2>They really care about the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between blacks and whites.</v>

776
00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:56.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Obama has throughout his eight </v>

777
00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:00.800
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

778
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.800
<v Speaker 2>when he could have ignored the race card</v>
<v Speaker 2>or put it in perspective,</v>

779
00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:04.720
<v Speaker 2>picked it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

780
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.620
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Cambridge police or whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

781
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trayvon Martin.</v>

782
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:10.460
<v Speaker 2>If I had a Sony would look like Trayvon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's invoking ferguson,</v>

783
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.593
<v Speaker 2>whether it's hiring somebody like Eric </v>
<v Speaker 2>Holder lecturing in the country on race </v>

784
00:35:13.731 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 2>and racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

785
00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Obama I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believes that racism remains this huge,</v>

786
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:21.460
<v Speaker 2>massive problem in America despite his </v>
<v Speaker 2>election and despite his reelection.</v>

787
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:22.443
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I don't think he's going to say </v>

788
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.580
<v Speaker 2>the right thing and do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

789
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.503
<v Speaker 2>I think he's encouraged black people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of themselves as victims as </v>

790
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 2>opposed to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at me.</v>

791
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I busted my bud.</v>

792
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.390
<v Speaker 2>My parents made sure I had a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

793
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make bad moral mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

794
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I got married before I had kids follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>my model and you'll be fine.</v>

795
00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 2>He has not said that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he said is,</v>

796
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.633
<v Speaker 2>we have real problems in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He embraced the black lives matter </v>

797
00:35:46.921 --> 00:35:47.750
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

798
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned Trayvon Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned some of the other things.</v>

799
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:50.903
<v Speaker 2>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that a lot of people voted </v>

800
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:54.354
<v Speaker 2>for Obama was because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought he was going to do exactly </v>

801
00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:58.470
<v Speaker 2>what you suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to heal us,</v>

802
00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.423
<v Speaker 2>put things in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell young black people they ought not </v>

803
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 2>be angry when they're pulled over by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>

804
00:36:03.391 --> 00:36:05.850
<v Speaker 2>All the copies is doing is his job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

805
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 2>he did the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not optimistic at all.</v>

806
00:36:08.341 --> 00:36:10.080
<v Speaker 2>The he'll play the kind of role that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd suggest.</v>

807
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way we've demon hope I'm wrong.</v>

808
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I hope you're on too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

809
00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:17.160
<v Speaker 2>But the way we've demonized cops as part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>

810
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.121
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

811
00:36:18.121 --> 00:36:18.954
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of times people are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming about how evil cops are and </v>

812
00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 2>they're hunting people down in all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

813
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know a ton of cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew some in New York and I know a</v>

814
00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:27.084
<v Speaker 2>couple here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean generally they're trying to do </v>

815
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.361
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

816
00:36:30.361 --> 00:36:31.194
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have any experience in which </v>

817
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:33.923
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever been pulled over and had </v>

818
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.393
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably had been pulled over maybe </v>

819
00:36:37.141 --> 00:36:38.610
<v Speaker 2>more than almost anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

820
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I got my driver's license when I was 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half my learner's permit.</v>

821
00:36:42.151 --> 00:36:42.984
<v Speaker 2>And then when I was 16 I was able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive by myself and I probably looked </v>

822
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:47.910
<v Speaker 2>like I was 12 so I got pulled over </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a hundred times.</v>

823
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.550
<v Speaker 2>And with the exception of one or two </v>
<v Speaker 2>instances,</v>

824
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.710
<v Speaker 2>the encounter was brief and </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional.</v>

825
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:54.003
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time a cop told me to take my head </v>

826
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:55.734
<v Speaker 2>out of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the first time I got pulled </v>

827
00:36:57.541 --> 00:36:58.374
<v Speaker 2>over by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving and there was a light </v>

828
00:37:00.211 --> 00:37:02.200
<v Speaker 2>behind me and I knew I hadn't done </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

829
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 2>anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just keep going.</v>

830
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 2>The guy pulled over and screamed at me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

831
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:07.110
<v Speaker 2>why don't you pull over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

832
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:07.944
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to you,</v>

833
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:08.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I didn't,</v>

834
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I did anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

835
00:37:10.531 --> 00:37:12.460
<v Speaker 2>whenever you see some lights behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull over,</v>

836
00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.520
<v Speaker 2>get your head out of your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was right.</v>

837
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I should've had my head head of I ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

838
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:19.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

839
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.513
<v Speaker 2>the instances in which cops kill blacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>has declined 75% in the last 45 years </v>

840
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:26.304
<v Speaker 2>according to the CDC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the instances in which cops are </v>

841
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.990
<v Speaker 2>cops kill whites has pretty much flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>lined.</v>

842
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.170
<v Speaker 2>And so it's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is very,</v>

843
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.720
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rare for the cop to kill anybody,</v>

844
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 2>let alone an unarmed black person of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>965,</v>

845
00:37:40.471 --> 00:37:41.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

846
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.970
<v Speaker 2>people that were killed by the police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

847
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.823
<v Speaker 2>in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less than 4% were white cops killing an </v>

848
00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 2>unarmed black man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is very rare.</v>

849
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:49.583
<v Speaker 2>By contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 people were injured by lightning </v>

850
00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:53.790
<v Speaker 2>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only 250 people were killed.</v>

851
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Black people were killed by police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very,</v>

852
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:57.900
<v Speaker 2>very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how much of this,</v>

853
00:37:57.901 --> 00:38:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I know you talk about fake news and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get to that,</v>

854
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:03.720
<v Speaker 2>but how much of this is because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media is complicit in all of this.</v>

855
00:38:03.721 --> 00:38:04.980
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this morning,</v>

856
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>I think the Oscar nominations were put </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

857
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:10.080
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even seen them yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently there are more minorities</v>

858
00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:10.914
<v Speaker 2>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there aren't some more Latinos </v>

859
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.660
<v Speaker 2>and a Dev Patel and some more black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

860
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.793
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the last couple of years there's </v>

861
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:21.720
<v Speaker 2>been this Oscars so white thing to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can only speak for myself,</v>

862
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:24.240
<v Speaker 2>this is like keep your eye is just off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ball.</v>

863
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:25.074
<v Speaker 2>You're just paying attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong thing where it's nice to have </v>

864
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.213
<v Speaker 2>people nominated for these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're irrelevant in the scheme of </v>

865
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.880
<v Speaker 2>what's important and what you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>caring about is education and all that.</v>

866
00:38:35.881 --> 00:38:36.714
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the media has made such an </v>

867
00:38:37.301 --> 00:38:38.134
<v Speaker 2>importance out of this that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting the black community's eye </v>

868
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:42.124
<v Speaker 2>off what's actually important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be education and family and </v>

869
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 2>some of the others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree with you more.</v>

870
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an actor friend and I said,</v>

871
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 2>why is this important to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

872
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:52.204
<v Speaker 2>because it provides role models and </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhances the self esteem of black </v>

873
00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:56.260
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he said.</v>

874
00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.813
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you aware that black boys and black </v>

875
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:02.320
<v Speaker 2>girls have higher self esteem than white</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls and white boys?</v>

876
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.333
<v Speaker 2>This has been tested for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been the case for a long time and </v>

877
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 2>there are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few Asian actors and actresses,</v>

878
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:10.060
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

879
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Asian Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese Americans,</v>

880
00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:12.634
<v Speaker 2>Chinese Americans and Korean Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a per capita basis make more money </v>

881
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:16.420
<v Speaker 2>than virtually anybody else in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

882
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's utterly irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

883
00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.070
<v Speaker 2>And for us to pay attention to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also not true.</v>

884
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:22.743
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the last 15 years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly 10% or so of the nominees for </v>

885
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:28.540
<v Speaker 2>the major categories have been black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

886
00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:30.760
<v Speaker 2>They've been a couple of years where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been a shutout.</v>

887
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

888
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:33.440
<v Speaker 2>add it all up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

889
00:39:33.441 --> 00:39:35.440
<v Speaker 2>it's about parody with population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

890
00:39:35.441 --> 00:39:36.274
<v Speaker 2>So that's the irony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually within a couple of </v>

891
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:38.314
<v Speaker 2>percentage points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually has been a party and Jamie </v>

892
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Foxx who got an Oscar for four re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

893
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:45.280
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

894
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.181
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

895
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:47.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in connection with this Oscar.</v>

896
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.870
<v Speaker 2>So white movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

897
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.410
<v Speaker 2>act better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be better,</v>

898
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 2>raise your game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't demand,</v>

899
00:39:56.501 --> 00:39:57.760
<v Speaker 2>don't yell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't scream.</v>

900
00:39:57.761 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>act better.</v>

901
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.910
<v Speaker 2>You got an Oscar and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

902
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.793
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think part of the reason he said </v>

903
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 2>that is because it kind of demeans his </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oscar.</v>

904
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause then it means like you're,</v>

905
00:40:08.161 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 2>you're complaining that the Oscars are </v>
<v Speaker 2>so white.</v>

906
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 2>How did I get one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky.</v>

907
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just,</v>

908
00:40:14.561 --> 00:40:16.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe I was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

909
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.170
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that at times visibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>is important?</v>

910
00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:21.100
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

911
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I've had jack a Harry on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was the first black woman.</v>

912
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:27.280
<v Speaker 2>I think she wasn't for best supporting </v>
<v Speaker 2>actress in two to seven,</v>

913
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

914
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's around 1989 or so at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

915
00:40:31.811 --> 00:40:32.644
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that a certain amount of is</v>
<v Speaker 2>visibility may have been more important </v>

916
00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:36.550
<v Speaker 2>than it is now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

917
00:40:36.551 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Speaker 2>cause finally a black person did it even</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't think that the thing in and</v>

918
00:40:39.911 --> 00:40:41.710
<v Speaker 2>of itself is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is important?</v>

919
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.603
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember some years ago there was an </v>

920
00:40:44.711 --> 00:40:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Olympic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

921
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.473
<v Speaker 2>blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

922
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.120
<v Speaker 2>skier named Debbie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Debbie Thomas,</v>

923
00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I believe was her last name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was the first,</v>

924
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:52.623
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

925
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Black Olympian and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

926
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:55.720
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ice skating.</v>

927
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 2>And she was constantly ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are your role models?</v>

928
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:01.000
<v Speaker 2>Who are your role models?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who inspired you?</v>

929
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.830
<v Speaker 2>And finally to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of,</v>

930
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.390
<v Speaker 2>out of exasperation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

931
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to see somebody black do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something before I think I can do it.</v>

932
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I want to do something,</v>

933
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w w what's holding me back from doing it</v>

934
00:41:13.151 --> 00:41:17.350
<v Speaker 2>other than my own insecurities or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

935
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:17.750
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

936
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.780
<v Speaker 2>or inadequacies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get up and make it happen.</v>

937
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How exhausting is this conversation to </v>

938
00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:22.894
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean this literal conversation </v>

939
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just this thing,</v>

940
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:26.374
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of what you talk about has to </v>

941
00:41:27.411 --> 00:41:29.830
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately be framed around something</v>

942
00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:32.170
<v Speaker 2>that you don't even think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is real.</v>

943
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:33.063
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that you think should be </v>

944
00:41:34.431 --> 00:41:36.770
<v Speaker 2>put behind us that actually is behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

945
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:39.920
<v Speaker 2>And yet you have to talk about it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just on a personal note,</v>

946
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:41.660
<v Speaker 2>how does that feel for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bother me.</v>

947
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:42.494
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of a feeling that </v>

948
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 2>race and racism remain major problems in</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

949
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that you're approaching</v>

950
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:50.804
<v Speaker 2>this with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

951
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.460
<v Speaker 2>with sincerity and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

952
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and since and real concern.</v>

953
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.423
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's that big of a </v>

954
00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:56.834
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

955
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:57.763
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've emailed duray Mckesson [inaudible] </v>

956
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:59.803
<v Speaker 2>who's the leader?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the quasi leader of black lives </v>

957
00:42:01.131 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't responded,</v>

958
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:03.530
<v Speaker 2>but I will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will ask him again.</v>

959
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just playing favorites.</v>

960
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm just putting that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

961
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:07.883
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

962
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is America.</v>

963
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:11.460
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

964
00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.750
<v Speaker 2>There are Cubans who are braving shark </v>
<v Speaker 2>infested waters to get here.</v>

965
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.120
<v Speaker 2>There are people from Central America </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up here.</v>

966
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.163
<v Speaker 2>Why do people come here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does so many people want to come to </v>

967
00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:22.940
<v Speaker 2>America and is because it is the land of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free and the home of the brave.</v>

968
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.983
<v Speaker 2>It is a place where you can go from </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to something a faster than it </v>

969
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:30.800
<v Speaker 2>anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in all of human history.</v>

970
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:31.903
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're here and to me again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are are almost giving the fourth </v>

971
00:42:36.961 --> 00:42:39.170
<v Speaker 2>finger to all the people fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggled,</v>

972
00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:40.004
<v Speaker 2>worked hard and died for people to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in 2017 in Bitch Moan and whine </v>

973
00:42:43.911 --> 00:42:45.220
<v Speaker 2>about race and racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

974
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I suspect I know your answer to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you make of all these people</v>

975
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:48.524
<v Speaker 2>that now want to look back on history </v>
<v Speaker 2>and label everyone racist from back </v>

976
00:42:52.131 --> 00:42:53.600
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I was at Monte Cello,</v>

977
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:54.434
<v Speaker 2>which was Thomas Jefferson's home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Jefferson who owned slaves who </v>

978
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.670
<v Speaker 2>was sleeping with at least one sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think several who they,</v>

979
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.170
<v Speaker 2>by the way at Monte Cello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took the tour.</v>

980
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 2>There's only about a year and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

981
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.280
<v Speaker 2>they fully owned up to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not.</v>

982
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was incredible what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

983
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.123
<v Speaker 2>They said this man was writing the laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>to free the slaves at the same time he </v>

984
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:17.120
<v Speaker 2>was sleeping with the slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think you could probably make an</v>

985
00:43:17.121 --> 00:43:17.954
<v Speaker 2>argument was rape in a certain respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they weren't equals right now </v>

986
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying he's a rapist in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional sense,</v>

987
00:43:23.571 --> 00:43:25.640
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see that argument being made,</v>

988
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.350
<v Speaker 2>but what about that concept that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to look back at?</v>

989
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.193
<v Speaker 2>What the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the left is now trying to do is </v>

990
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:30.944
<v Speaker 2>look at all of our founding fathers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take them out of the give our 2017 </v>

991
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.840
<v Speaker 2>morality to them who lived very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

992
00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:39.674
<v Speaker 2>I mean without Thomas Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the slaves do not get fried as quickly </v>

993
00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:43.034
<v Speaker 2>as they did.</v>

994
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.533
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea of going back and </v>

995
00:43:46.311 --> 00:43:48.860
<v Speaker 2>airbrushing history and looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>history through the,</v>

996
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:52.520
<v Speaker 2>through the filter of today's a morality</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pretty silly.</v>

997
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I think all a state can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just in its own time.</v>

998
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we're trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do right now.</v>

999
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.373
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are right to call a slavery </v>

1000
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America's original sin.</v>

1001
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:06.410
<v Speaker 2>But without a compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have had an America.</v>

1002
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.693
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1003
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 2>and there was 750,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1004
00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 2>both sides who died in order to free the</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaves.</v>

1005
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>And people don't really have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of,</v>

1006
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:15.590
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1007
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:16.520
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1008
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 2>the scale of the sacrifice that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

1009
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.473
<v Speaker 2>750,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people at a time when this country was </v>

1010
00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 2>just 10% the size of what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like 7.5</v>

1011
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:27.720
<v Speaker 2>million people dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1012
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 2>in order for there to be an outcome with</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaves are freed and that's the,</v>

1013
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 2>and are the people that died and not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones who've been injured.</v>

1014
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.000
<v Speaker 2>It was a horrific thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1015
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that America went through.</v>

1016
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:37.471
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1017
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 2>and on the other side comes the 13th </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>

1018
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:41.520
<v Speaker 2>the 14th Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 15th Amendment,</v>

1019
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights movement and,</v>

1020
00:44:43.241 --> 00:44:44.790
<v Speaker 2>and all the things that have happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>since then,</v>

1021
00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.490
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a country they went to war over</v>

1022
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:48.650
<v Speaker 2>this proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:49.583
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of this intersectional </v>

1024
00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:51.294
<v Speaker 2>thing that we have going on now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we saw a lot of it at the </v>

1025
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:54.310
<v Speaker 2>woman's March,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1026
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 2>this past weekend where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of people that are trying</v>

1027
00:44:57.241 --> 00:44:58.074
<v Speaker 2>to conflate trans issues with black </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues and then Muslim issues with </v>

1028
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.490
<v Speaker 2>women's issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just this whole thing where,</v>

1029
00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:06.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about all the time this </v>

1030
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:07.434
<v Speaker 2>oppression Olympics and now we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all tied together by this </v>

1031
00:45:10.451 --> 00:45:11.284
<v Speaker 2>oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they all have to kind of beat each </v>

1032
00:45:13.081 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 2>other and oppression to be the winner.</v>

1033
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 2>This is a toxic mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1034
00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.551
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1035
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:18.384
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what I call the victim correct </v>

1036
00:45:19.321 --> 00:45:22.000
<v Speaker 2>culture where everybody has a grievance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1037
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.140
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's making a demand on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government to solve that grievance,</v>

1038
00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when in fact,</v>

1039
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.283
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have far more in common than we have </v>

1040
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:32.580
<v Speaker 2>apart and we ought to celebrate our </v>
<v Speaker 2>similarities and we're not doing that.</v>

1041
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's move to trump then.</v>

1042
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I think what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an interesting segway to trump.</v>

1043
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:41.790
<v Speaker 2>So there seems to be this feeling that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the white supremacist back,</v>

1044
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.200
<v Speaker 2>they're back in business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it should be,</v>

1045
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.830
<v Speaker 2>and it's because of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I saw this.</v>

1046
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you see this video of this Guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Spencer,</v>

1047
00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:51.000
<v Speaker 2>who's The alt right guy and you got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in hunched?</v>

1048
00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.720
<v Speaker 2>He got punched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted out that I,</v>

1049
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:58.500
<v Speaker 2>this guy has obviously bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had family members on both sides of</v>

1050
00:45:58.501 --> 00:45:59.790
<v Speaker 2>my family killed in the Holocaust.</v>

1051
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 2>So I am not a Nazi sympathizer in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1052
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:03.683
<v Speaker 2>but I have to defend his right to free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech without being punched because </v>

1053
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.660
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just defend it when it's easy.</v>

1054
00:46:09.661 --> 00:46:10.950
<v Speaker 2>You got to defend it when you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1055
00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw a lot of people on the left,</v>

1056
00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:14.394
<v Speaker 2>a lot of famous people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people with a lot of </v>

1057
00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:16.171
<v Speaker 2>influencing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1058
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:17.004
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to punch Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if you just follow their logic </v>

1059
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:20.214
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he could have killed him cause you </v>

1060
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:21.954
<v Speaker 2>could accidentally kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if it's okay to punch a random </v>

1061
00:46:25.111 --> 00:46:28.320
<v Speaker 2>person because of their beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we blow up his car?</v>

1062
00:46:28.321 --> 00:46:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Can we bombed his house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a,</v>

1063
00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 2>this is a horrifically slippery slope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1064
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it is.</v>

1065
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it okay for me to,</v>

1066
00:46:35.131 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to burn up a building,</v>

1067
00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm unhappy with,</v>

1068
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.250
<v Speaker 2>because of the way the police treat me </v>
<v Speaker 2>are riots perfectly.</v>

1069
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1070
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.113
<v Speaker 2>would it be okay if somebody walked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to John Lewis and punched him because </v>

1071
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 2>they feel that John Lewis should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>attended the Donald Trump inaugural?</v>

1072
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Where do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do we go with this?</v>

1073
00:46:49.591 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1074
00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.560
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and believe me,</v>

1075
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:53.394
<v Speaker 2>it would have been a huge story if that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been somebody like John Lewis who </v>

1076
00:46:55.951 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 2>had been punched as opposed to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spencer Guy,</v>

1077
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the media doesn't care about.</v>

1078
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feels is loathsome.</v>

1079
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.123
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would've thought that would've </v>

1080
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 2>been a little more coverage of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't very much.</v>

1081
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know a certain amount of people are</v>

1082
00:47:07.941 --> 00:47:09.030
<v Speaker 2>gonna Watch this and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1083
00:47:09.031 --> 00:47:09.864
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a black guy and a Jew somehow </v>

1084
00:47:11.521 --> 00:47:13.320
<v Speaker 2>defending a Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to free speech.</v>

1085
00:47:13.321 --> 00:47:14.154
<v Speaker 2>He wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he'd want to kick both </v>

1086
00:47:15.001 --> 00:47:18.060
<v Speaker 2>of us out of the country or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to that.</v>

1087
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.160
<v Speaker 2>But it's tough to have principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1088
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.023
<v Speaker 2>I mean it isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that the crux of what you're </v>

1089
00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:22.914
<v Speaker 2>saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the through line of all of </v>

1090
00:47:23.721 --> 00:47:26.840
<v Speaker 2>this is you got to have some principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it voltaire who said,</v>

1091
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:27.683
<v Speaker 2>I guess we have what you've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would defend to my death your </v>

1092
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:30.334
<v Speaker 2>right to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're talking about principles </v>

1093
00:47:31.421 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1094
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:32.970
<v Speaker 2>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1095
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.053
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not unlawful to it to hate </v>

1096
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:36.520
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hate somebody.</v>

1097
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 2>As you pointed out earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't put your hand on that person,</v>

1098
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:41.830
<v Speaker 2>but you have every right to dislike </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody for whatever reason you want.</v>

1099
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:42.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sense that a lot of people think </v>

1100
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:47.620
<v Speaker 2>though that white supremacy is back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>

1101
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.160
<v Speaker 2>that they feel that there was a link to </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump somehow.</v>

1102
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.113
<v Speaker 2>I don't really see that link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there there was a link that somehow </v>

1103
00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:59.510
<v Speaker 2>he unearthed this and now pepe the frog </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Rob Bay,</v>

1104
00:47:59.511 --> 00:48:03.220
<v Speaker 2>the monkey and the white supremacists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been unearthed and now they feel</v>

1105
00:48:03.221 --> 00:48:04.054
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

1106
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.940
<v Speaker 2>So their only response is to hit back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue,</v>

1107
00:48:06.941 --> 00:48:07.774
<v Speaker 2>which I think you would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is your beat them with better </v>

1108
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:09.844
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let this 80th talk and guess what he's </v>

1109
00:48:11.771 --> 00:48:14.860
<v Speaker 2>going to show what a fraudulent bigot he</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is.</v>

1110
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1111
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:19.770
<v Speaker 2>but do you think there's any resurgence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of actual white supremacy?</v>

1112
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a real issue?</v>

1113
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1114
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump got a higher percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the black vote.</v>

1115
00:48:25.991 --> 00:48:27.880
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitt Romney did and John Mccain did.</v>

1116
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:30.280
<v Speaker 2>He got a higher percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney did.</v>

1117
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a smaller percentage of the white</v>

1118
00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:33.740
<v Speaker 2>vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then his,</v>

1119
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his predecessor,</v>

1120
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.640
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1121
00:48:35.641 --> 00:48:36.210
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1122
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 2>the Republican rand beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not seeing it.</v>

1123
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I am seeing a resurgence in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1124
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assertion that white supremacy is back,</v>

1125
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1126
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of Donald Trump's,</v>

1127
00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:50.284
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a surrogate's was doctor Ben Carson is </v>

1128

1129
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:54.543
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that's going to cozy up to </v>

1130
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 2>somebody who is a white supremacist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1131
00:48:57.671 --> 00:48:59.590
<v Speaker 2>one of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven Miller,</v>

1132
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1133
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:02.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech writer who wrote Donald Trump's </v>

1134
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 2>inaugural speech and wrote his rnc </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

1135
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.250
<v Speaker 2>He's about 30 in his early thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known him since he was a teenager.</v>

1136
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:10.323
<v Speaker 2>He is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody is going to work for it for a </v>

1137
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.480
<v Speaker 2>white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He happens to be a Jew.</v>

1138
00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so donald trump's a wrong vehicle to peg</v>

1139
00:49:19.091 --> 00:49:19.924
<v Speaker 2>that on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And John Lewis said that he was not </v>

1140
00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:23.224
<v Speaker 2>going to attend his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his inauguration the first time in all </v>

1141
00:49:25.511 --> 00:49:26.344
<v Speaker 2>of his years being in Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to to attend the </v>

1142
00:49:27.791 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 2>presidential inauguration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>False.</v>

1143
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:30.401
<v Speaker 2>If he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1144
00:49:30.401 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Speaker 2>he did not attend George W Bush's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inauguration.</v>

1145
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Now with George W.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush a Nazi.</v>

1146
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 2>What's he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's he a fascist?</v>

1147
00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Was he a racist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was your argument?</v>

1148
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lewis,</v>

1149
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:39.003
<v Speaker 2>if he were here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd ask him for not attending George W </v>

1150
00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Bush's inauguration.</v>

1151
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I understand donald trump's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but explaining George W.</v>

1152
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Bush to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1153
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.813
<v Speaker 2>So is that the crazy position that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people have painted themselves into </v>

1154
00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:52.240
<v Speaker 2>now they've screamed and ranted and </v>
<v Speaker 2>raved that trump and this whole movement</v>

1155
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:54.820
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is vial and racist and all this stuff.</v>

1156
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.310
<v Speaker 2>We're now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he does any good,</v>

1157
00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.593
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have to lash out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy ways because you can't have a guy </v>

1158
00:50:01.481 --> 00:50:03.640
<v Speaker 2>that you've been calling Hitler for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1159
00:50:03.641 --> 00:50:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly you can't suddenly admit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing some good stuff,</v>

1160
00:50:06.581 --> 00:50:07.414
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've put themselves in a really </v>

1161
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 2>tight intellectual box here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have,</v>

1162
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:13.960
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump is a bad vehicle,</v>

1163
00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:14.651
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1164
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:17.650
<v Speaker 2>to do that with because if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of his points of view,</v>

1165
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 2>they are quite populous and quite left </v>
<v Speaker 2>wing.</v>

1166
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 2>He and Bernie Sanders were completing </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other's sentences on free trade.</v>

1167
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:25.023
<v Speaker 2>And when a Donald Trump had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview with 60 minutes and he was </v>

1168
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 2>asked about same sex marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it was settled law.</v>

1169
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 2>He could have said the same thing he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about abortion,</v>

1170
00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:34.394
<v Speaker 2>which was I'm going to put on a justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>who ultimately would turn over Roe v </v>

1171
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:37.933
<v Speaker 2>Wade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say that,</v>

1172
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.833
<v Speaker 2>but that's really what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1173
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.733
<v Speaker 2>what he wants to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he could have said that regarding </v>

1174
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.370
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1175
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage is less settled law then </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion.</v>

1176
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.313
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion has been on the books since </v>

1177
00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:50.174
<v Speaker 2>1973.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gay marriage decision just now came </v>

1178
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:52.551
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1179
00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:53.384
<v Speaker 2>so your argument is that he's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>more for gay marriage than he is for </v>

1180
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 2>abortion on gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to Steve Croft,</v>

1181
00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.960
<v Speaker 2>that issue has been settled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really he could have said,</v>

1182
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put on justices that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1183
00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:07.040
<v Speaker 2>that we'll look at the constitution and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have all these issues.</v>

1184
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Go back to the state like abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't,</v>

1185
00:51:09.471 --> 00:51:11.570
<v Speaker 2>he said same sex marriage is settled </v>
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

1186
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:12.980
<v Speaker 2>which was his way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

1187
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.590
<v Speaker 2>of signaling to all of the people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1188
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.310
<v Speaker 2>especially his critics that I am okay </v>
<v Speaker 2>with same sex marriage.</v>

1189
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned,</v>

1190
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:21.890
<v Speaker 2>on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on free trade,</v>

1191
00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:23.020
<v Speaker 2>he and Bernie Sanders were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1192
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.863
<v Speaker 2>were identical and on infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants a trillion dollar </v>

1193
00:51:27.681 --> 00:51:28.740
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1194
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:30.290
<v Speaker 2>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1195
00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Schumer just now said that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay with that.</v>

1196
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have chuck Schumer smiling,</v>

1197
00:51:34.011 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me you ought to be worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>

1198
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.033
<v Speaker 2>these are the kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they felt that Obama's stimulus was </v>

1199
00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:42.500
<v Speaker 2>too small and this is bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>

1200
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.393
<v Speaker 2>they're giddy over all over all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why Donald Trump is engendering all </v>

1201
00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:49.640
<v Speaker 2>of this hostility when he has so many a </v>
<v Speaker 2>centrist,</v>

1202
00:51:49.641 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 2>if not leveling point of view is beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1203
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:52.603
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it has to do is just the way he </v>

1204
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:54.690
<v Speaker 2>speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you know,</v>

1205
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.633
<v Speaker 2>my concern about him from day one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've said a thousand times in that </v>

1206
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his moral center is,</v>

1207
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:00.980
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what a lot of these guys,</v>

1208
00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:04.280
<v Speaker 2>moral center is at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them speak a lot clearer.</v>

1209
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.780
<v Speaker 2>So you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you know it,</v>

1210
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you don't know it.</v>

1211
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:09.710
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably argue that about Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for trump,</v>

1212
00:52:09.711 --> 00:52:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That being said,</v>

1213
00:52:11.241 --> 00:52:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I think the answer to your question is I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think the left no longer has the ability</v>

1214
00:52:15.411 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 2>to understand the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>words and actions.</v>

1215
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:18.673
<v Speaker 2>So they see his gruff language and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>poorly phrase things and that he speaks </v>

1216
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:26.450
<v Speaker 2>not that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they think that translates into</v>

1217
00:52:26.451 --> 00:52:27.284
<v Speaker 2>action when in fact he actually did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things that brought them more </v>

1218
00:52:29.841 --> 00:52:30.674
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it goes back to what we said </v>

1219
00:52:32.241 --> 00:52:33.920
<v Speaker 2>earlier and there's just a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking.</v>

1220
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I think we are at the end of your name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1221
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.240
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden there are certain sets </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1222
00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 2>of views that people assume you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

1223
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.070
<v Speaker 2>they go after those views.</v>

1224
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at his,</v>

1225
00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.820
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his moral center.</v>

1226
00:52:46.821 --> 00:52:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I look at Donald Trump's family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1227
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 2>these kids adore him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's had three different marriages.</v>

1228
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:53.900
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated to pull all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1229
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Three different marriages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1230
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.413
<v Speaker 2>children from all three of the marriages</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they all get along and they all </v>

1231
00:52:58.851 --> 00:53:01.070
<v Speaker 2>worked up their father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How bad a guy can he be?</v>

1232
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:02.181
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

1233
00:53:02.181 --> 00:53:03.014
<v Speaker 2>I had Donald Trump jr on my Sirius xm </v>
<v Speaker 2>show talking about how he was for gay </v>

1234
00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:08.174
<v Speaker 2>marriage is about a little bit before it</v>
<v Speaker 2>got passed it about let's say three </v>

1235
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:12.260
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years ago.</v>

1236
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:14.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about how he personally was </v>
<v Speaker 2>for gay marriage,</v>

1237
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:16.730
<v Speaker 2>even though his dad was in it and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad said,</v>

1238
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.590
<v Speaker 2>you go out and tell people whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

1239
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:21.280
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that that's actually a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>marker of,</v>

1240
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:23.840
<v Speaker 2>of sort of what a father should be.</v>

1241
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you his authoritarian side at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as you said,</v>

1242
00:53:27.361 --> 00:53:28.194
<v Speaker 2>small l libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you want the government to scale </v>

1243
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:32.250
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sense he is going,</v>

1244
00:53:32.251 --> 00:53:32.611
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1245
00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:33.444
<v Speaker 2>he's going to lower taxes and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>already doing some stuff with </v>

1246
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Speaker 2>regulations that you're probably four </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of stuff,</v>

1247
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:40.650
<v Speaker 2>but do you sense there could be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian side even controlling what</v>

1248
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:44.130
<v Speaker 2>businesses can do overseas and that kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff that you may not like?</v>

1249
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:45.683
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things he said that I don't </v>

1250
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:47.551
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1251
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I would label them </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian.</v>

1252
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I would label them as stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1253
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:52.943
<v Speaker 2>saying I'm going to put on a 30 or 40% </v>
<v Speaker 2>tariff on goods that come in for this </v>

1254
00:53:55.831 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've left the country and started a</v>

1255
00:53:57.661 --> 00:53:58.494
<v Speaker 2>factory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you're doing is discriminating </v>

1256
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:03.060
<v Speaker 2>against cheap prices and hurting </v>
<v Speaker 2>American consumers.</v>

1257
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:04.223
<v Speaker 2>I as a business person have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation to maximize shareholder </v>

1258
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:09.203
<v Speaker 2>return.</v>

1259
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:10.133
<v Speaker 2>And if my biggest cost is labor and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go somewhere else and build my </v>

1260
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:14.520
<v Speaker 2>widgets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1261
00:54:14.521 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 2>for less money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an obligation to do that.</v>

1262
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 2>And if I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my competitor will.</v>

1263
00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.480
<v Speaker 2>And for a business person like Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump to tell another business person,</v>

1264
00:54:21.481 --> 00:54:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to punish you for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for seeking profits to me is outrageous.</v>

1265
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.513
<v Speaker 2>I understand and support his idea that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the reason people go overseas </v>

1266
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.900
<v Speaker 2>because we have onerous regulations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>high corporate tax.</v>

1267
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Once you lower the regulations and lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corporate taxation,</v>

1268
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.560
<v Speaker 2>and I had a CEO had made a calculation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can make more money by putting my</v>

1269
00:54:40.561 --> 00:54:43.950
<v Speaker 2>factory I in a third world country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you tax me for,</v>

1270
00:54:43.951 --> 00:54:45.810
<v Speaker 2>for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get you the right to do that.</v>

1271
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would basically argue that if you</v>

1272
00:54:47.581 --> 00:54:48.414
<v Speaker 2>lowered the corporate tax rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did everything he could to unregulate </v>

1273
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:51.564
<v Speaker 2>business here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't need that tax on the </v>

1274
00:54:54.451 --> 00:54:58.110
<v Speaker 2>overseas stuff because it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>humming and pairing nicely here.</v>

1275
00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.253
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't need to leave the country </v>

1276
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.190
<v Speaker 2>to set up a factory because you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay here.</v>

1277
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:03.343
<v Speaker 2>What we have right now are all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental rules and regulations </v>

1278
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:08.610
<v Speaker 2>designed to fight climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a very high corporate tax rate,</v>

1279
00:55:08.611 --> 00:55:10.780
<v Speaker 2>the highest in the industrialized world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1280
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:14.160
<v Speaker 2>you deal with those kinds of things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll take away the incentive that some</v>

1281
00:55:14.161 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 2>ceos have a to move outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1282
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:21.230
<v Speaker 2>But so when you take all those away and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you lower the lower the,</v>

1283
00:55:21.231 --> 00:55:23.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regulatory burdens that ceos have to</v>

1284
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:25.620
<v Speaker 2>deal with and they still want to put a </v>
<v Speaker 2>factory somewhere,</v>

1285
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.400
<v Speaker 2>you have absolutely no right to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>them from doing that,</v>

1286
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.593
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's hilarious how we look </v>

1287
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.710
<v Speaker 2>at certain companies that do the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>same things as other companies?</v>

1288
00:55:34.711 --> 00:55:35.311
<v Speaker 2>Some are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1289
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Some are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1290
00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:40.100
<v Speaker 2>trump made his ties in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I kept saying all along,</v>

1291
00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:41.220
<v Speaker 2>this isn't something you're getting him </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1292
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1293
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 2>he's proving the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's proving the point that it's cheaper</v>

1294
00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:45.474
<v Speaker 2>to do there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the regulations and then he </v>

1295
00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:47.574
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have to at the same time a </v>
<v Speaker 2>company and trump was mocked </v>

1296
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:51.420
<v Speaker 2>relentlessly for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1297
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:52.883
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple designs their stuff in Cupertino </v>

1298
00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:58.590
<v Speaker 2>as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all made in China and they hide</v>

1299
00:55:58.591 --> 00:55:59.424
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of stuff tax wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're all walking around with </v>

1300
00:56:01.171 --> 00:56:03.510
<v Speaker 2>iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come some companies are able to,</v>

1301
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.210
<v Speaker 2>that's just the cool factor of apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1302
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:07.044
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Al Gore was on the board of </v>

1303
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:11.280
<v Speaker 2>directors of apple at one point or if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't now,</v>

1304
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here they are manufacturing stuff in</v>

1305
00:56:13.261 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1306
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some companies have better pr than other</v>

1307
00:56:16.741 --> 00:56:18.290
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also sold current TV,</v>

1308
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Al Jazeera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is owned by Cutera,</v>

1309
00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest exporters of oil in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1310
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what we digress.</v>

1311
00:56:24.731 --> 00:56:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Let's not dwell on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1312
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.360
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1313
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.313
<v Speaker 2>let's move over to fake news because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so tied into what's happening </v>

1314
00:56:32.081 --> 00:56:32.914
<v Speaker 2>with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outrage machine and then the fake </v>

1315
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:36.910
<v Speaker 2>news machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this,</v>

1316
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:41.800
<v Speaker 2>you've been all over this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am just a pocket,</v>

1317
00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:45.610
<v Speaker 2>a pap apoplectic and apoplectic about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with this.</v>

1318
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Because I see the mainstream media </v>
<v Speaker 2>crumbling.</v>

1319
00:56:47.531 --> 00:56:48.364
<v Speaker 2>I see online media growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I see risks in that too because </v>

1320
00:56:50.621 --> 00:56:51.454
<v Speaker 2>anybody can put on a tie and pretend </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're somebody and get a desk and </v>

1321
00:56:54.221 --> 00:56:54.791
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1322
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:56.380
<v Speaker 2>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1323
00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.440
<v Speaker 2>how bad is this scorge of fake news?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've always had really bad fake</v>

1324
00:57:02.171 --> 00:57:04.210
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just got passed off as CBS,</v>

1325
00:57:04.211 --> 00:57:06.340
<v Speaker 2>NBC or ABC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1326
00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there've been lots of stories in my </v>

1327
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:09.360
<v Speaker 2>opinion that had been fake news.</v>

1328
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Stories are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them was,</v>

1329
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1330
00:57:11.531 --> 00:57:14.650
<v Speaker 2>when Obama was pushing obamacare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said over and over again,</v>

1331
00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:15.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that his mother who was suffering from </v>

1332
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:19.210
<v Speaker 2>cancer as she lay dying in her hospital </v>
<v Speaker 2>bed in Hawaii,</v>

1333
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:20.283
<v Speaker 2>had to fight with her insurance carrier </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay for her medical bills and her </v>

1334
00:57:22.301 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 2>hospital bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out it is not true.</v>

1335
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:25.593
<v Speaker 2>He said it over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A book came out by a woman named Janice </v>

1336
00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.381
<v Speaker 2>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who used to work with the New York </v>

1337
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore it must be a good book.</v>

1338
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.210
<v Speaker 2>And she said that those bills were </v>
<v Speaker 2>promptly paid.</v>

1339
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 2>The only coral was that Obama's mom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad had taken out a,</v>

1340
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:38.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1341
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:39.960
<v Speaker 2>a policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1342
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:42.940
<v Speaker 2>so that if she got sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would be entitled to money.</v>

1343
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.370
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law is that if you are,</v>

1344
00:57:46.371 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 2>have been diagnosed you and you try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take our policy like that,</v>

1345
00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:50.471
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1346
00:57:50.471 --> 00:57:51.280
<v Speaker 2>we can challenge it.</v>

1347
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But regarding her medical bills,</v>

1348
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:55.240
<v Speaker 2>hospital bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were paid promptly,</v>

1349
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 2>but he said it over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1350
00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 2>And it helped to drive the narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if my more that got jacked over and</v>

1351
00:58:01.091 --> 00:58:04.840
<v Speaker 2>she has a phd and has a son from Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a law degree,</v>

1352
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.030
<v Speaker 2>imagine what these insurance carriers </v>
<v Speaker 2>will do to you.</v>

1353
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.160
<v Speaker 2>It turns out complete completely not </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1354
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Another fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1355
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.273
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I said earlier when Obama said </v>

1356
00:58:13.691 --> 00:58:14.524
<v Speaker 2>during his many pref press conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am most proud of the fact that I </v>

1357
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:22.180
<v Speaker 2>rescue the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really tarp was done by George W.</v>

1358
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bailouts were done by George W.</v>

1359
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:24.551
<v Speaker 2>Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1360
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:26.350
<v Speaker 2>and many of the things that Obama has </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

1361
00:58:26.351 --> 00:58:28.450
<v Speaker 2>including stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually hurt the recovery,</v>

1362
00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 2>didn't help it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1363
00:58:29.351 --> 00:58:31.090
<v Speaker 2>he says this over and over again with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight face.</v>

1364
00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.013
<v Speaker 2>And the failure of the media not to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging questions when he raises </v>

1365
00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:35.560
<v Speaker 2>that to me is fake news.</v>

1366
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 2>So that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not to split hairs there,</v>

1367
00:58:38.051 --> 00:58:40.960
<v Speaker 2>but that's the issue that we've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically a lapdog media.</v>

1368
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:41.913
<v Speaker 2>So there's the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when the left talks about fake </v>

1369
00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:44.374
<v Speaker 2>news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about these right wing </v>

1370
00:58:44.891 --> 00:58:46.780
<v Speaker 2>sites that are just making up things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1371
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:47.763
<v Speaker 2>They push a lot of that on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Breitbart and we can talk about that </v>

1372
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:50.503
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's different than what you're </v>

1373
00:58:52.451 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just immediate.</v>

1374
00:58:53.981 --> 00:58:58.390
<v Speaker 2>That just simply got cozy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got cozy with the people in power,</v>

1375
00:58:58.391 --> 00:59:02.080
<v Speaker 2>so they just stopped doing their job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're calling that fake news.</v>

1376
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are two separate types of fake.</v>

1377
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:05.763
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked earlier about Obama pulling </v>

1378
00:59:07.451 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 2>completely out of Iraq over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>objection of his,</v>

1379
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:10.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his team.</v>

1380
00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.090
<v Speaker 2>He also then said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1381
00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:15.220
<v Speaker 2>the reason I did that is because George </v>
<v Speaker 2>W.</v>

1382
00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Bush had negotiated a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an agreement that required me to leave.</v>

1383
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.350
<v Speaker 2>At the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did completely not true.</v>

1384
00:59:20.351 --> 00:59:22.580
<v Speaker 2>George W.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush negotiated an agreement,</v>

1385
00:59:22.581 --> 00:59:26.990
<v Speaker 2>but he fully expected his successor to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiate a stay behind force.</v>

1386
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama has said this over and over again,</v>

1387
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.620
<v Speaker 2>and the media hasn't said anything about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1388
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Speaker 2>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake news.</v>

1389
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:33.343
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I remember when that happened and I </v>

1390
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking when Obama said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1391
00:59:36.681 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had set the date,</v>

1392
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:42.110
<v Speaker 2>but obviously Obama had plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political capitol at the time.</v>

1393
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.090
<v Speaker 2>If he had wanted to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could've stayed.</v>

1394
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just a,</v>

1395
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:47.354
<v Speaker 2>it's just a conflation of poor media </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices and we saw a lot of this with </v>

1396
00:59:51.231 --> 00:59:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just pour media practices,</v>

1397
00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:55.080
<v Speaker 2>the willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the willingness to,</v>

1398
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.353
<v Speaker 2>the willingness to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the willingness to look the other way </v>

1399
00:59:57.261 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 2>because it's a guy that you're pulling </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1400
00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Obama came into office,</v>

1401
01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:04.490
<v Speaker 2>he reneged on a deal that George W.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush and negotiated.</v>

1402
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.473
<v Speaker 2>He negotiated a deal with Poland and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Czech Republic to for them to get </v>

1403
01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 2>missile defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia didn't like it.</v>

1404
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Obama thought that he could curry favor </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Russia by reneging on the deal.</v>

1405
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1406
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:16.063
<v Speaker 2>the failure of the media to bring this </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and to bring up him saying him and </v>

1407
01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:22.610
<v Speaker 2>pushing the reset button and him saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Medvedev,</v>

1408
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I get reelected I have more,</v>

1409
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:25.423
<v Speaker 2>I'll have more flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The failure of the media to bring this </v>

1410
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:28.454
<v Speaker 2>up when they're hitting Donald Trump for</v>
<v Speaker 2>being too cozy with Putin is another </v>

1411
01:00:31.191 --> 01:00:32.024
<v Speaker 2>example of fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that to me is the monster that we've </v>

1412
01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did nothing for so long now because</v>

1413
01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:41.330
<v Speaker 2>they don't like trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to be professionals,</v>

1414
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:42.643
<v Speaker 2>which I want them to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to do true investigative </v>

1415
01:00:45.171 --> 01:00:47.300
<v Speaker 2>journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them to fight the power.</v>

1416
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.343
<v Speaker 2>But they seem almost ridiculous doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>now because they're watching tweets and </v>

1417
01:00:51.501 --> 01:00:52.900
<v Speaker 2>getting outraged before weekend.</v>

1418
01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:53.763
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wrote a column about all of this </v>

1419
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.633
<v Speaker 2>and what I've said is that the media has</v>
<v Speaker 2>rediscovered their mission now that the </v>

1420
01:00:57.951 --> 01:01:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Republicans back in the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But before that,</v>

1421
01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:02.000
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't do their jobs.</v>

1422
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>

1423
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Almost too late for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they?</v>

1424
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.213
<v Speaker 2>Because I think they've lost so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit that even now is they scurry to </v>

1425
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:10.670
<v Speaker 2>get their credit back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1426
01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:11.630
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1427
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:15.500
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day before I watched the second Sean</v>

1428
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Spicer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1429
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:16.851
<v Speaker 2>press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1430
01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:19.350
<v Speaker 2>not the quick one where he was bickering</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the first official.</v>

1431
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I watched the first official one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1432
01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Monday and I watched the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire thing.</v>

1433
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing cardio or that's the only way </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can watch it.</v>

1434
01:01:25.761 --> 01:01:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to buy up to be moving.</v>

1435
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.600
<v Speaker 2>You got to run from the bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm watching this thing.</v>

1436
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:30.434
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he basically did a pretty </v>

1437
01:01:32.511 --> 01:01:33.080
<v Speaker 2>decent job.</v>

1438
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.980
<v Speaker 2>He took a good Julian questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He answered them in pretty much the same</v>

1439
01:01:36.981 --> 01:01:39.050
<v Speaker 2>way that all prices people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1440
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half answers and partially that's what </v>

1441
01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But suddenly I saw the headlines.</v>

1442
01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:45.403
<v Speaker 2>First of off the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main twitter moment headline was </v>

1443
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:49.670
<v Speaker 2>saying that he was focusing on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers of people there.</v>

1444
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.713
<v Speaker 2>That was just a small portion and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>only because they kept asking him that </v>

1445
01:01:53.601 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 2>same question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1446
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's also fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1447
01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Where they just keep framing something a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way,</v>

1448
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:01.670
<v Speaker 2>not just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just what it said,</v>

1449
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>but that you can take an hour and a half</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and go,</v>

1450
01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.613
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the part that was important </v>

1451
01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:08.331
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1452
01:02:08.331 --> 01:02:11.000
<v Speaker 2>it actually wasn't the part that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me say a couple of things about that</v>

1453
01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.373
<v Speaker 2>spicer and not only quarreled with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that trump's a audience was larger </v>

1454
01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:17.640
<v Speaker 2>than what the media report it.</v>

1455
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:18.943
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also talked about the fact that a </v>

1456
01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 2>reporter from Time magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1457
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:27.680
<v Speaker 2>not the Bug Tussle Gazette Time magazine</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that I'm a Donald Trump removed the</v>

1458
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:32.580
<v Speaker 2>bus to vml k from the Oval Office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that to me is a major story.</v>

1459
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.710
<v Speaker 2>If it were true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not true.</v>

1460
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1461
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:38.183
<v Speaker 2>reported for twice Time magazine tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it went around the world rather </v>

1462
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:42.744
<v Speaker 2>than focus on that fake news part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about what Sean Spicer said </v>

1463
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:47.034
<v Speaker 2>about the crowd size because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something they could probably make an </v>

1464
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:51.420
<v Speaker 2>argument about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the mlk thing,</v>

1465
01:02:51.421 --> 01:02:52.254
<v Speaker 2>they can't make an argument about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we haven't even talked about </v>

1466
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.770
<v Speaker 2>that and we found out because of Wiki </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaks.</v>

1467
01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.460
<v Speaker 2>David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of these reporters,</v>

1468
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:02.460
<v Speaker 2>we're in bed with the DNC in bed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary,</v>

1469
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean in New York Times reporter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a massive story on,</v>

1470
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.090
<v Speaker 2>on Hillary and and gave her veto proof </v>
<v Speaker 2>over quotes.</v>

1471
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:09.923
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't like a power that she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she in fact use and took out a </v>

1472
01:03:13.381 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 2>quote that she had made about Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pailin.</v>

1473
01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not making this up by the night </v>

1476
01:03:20.521 --> 01:03:21.354

<v Speaker 2>regarding money and gave him a heads up </v>

<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

01:03:51.151 --> 01:03:52.250
<v Speaker 2>He used eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1489
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:53.183
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even mention the most </v>

1490
01:03:54.181 --> 01:03:56.730
<v Speaker 2>egregious one in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the whole Donna Brazil thing,</v>

1491
01:03:56.731 --> 01:03:57.564
<v Speaker 2>which is to me the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that one is the heart of how </v>

1492
01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 2>corrupt media and politicians have </v>
<v Speaker 2>become.</v>

1493
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.600
<v Speaker 2>But at least cnn fired her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the d DNC hired her as interim chair</v>

1494
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:09.833
<v Speaker 2>even after she was out in his head as </v>
<v Speaker 2>having conspired with hilary to make </v>

1495
01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:14.780
<v Speaker 2>sure that Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1496
01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:15.300
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1497
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.081
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not win.</v>

1498
01:04:16.081 --> 01:04:18.990
<v Speaker 2>So what is at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the most are one of the most</v>

1499
01:04:18.991 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 2>outrageous ones is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1500
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.410
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Kurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can wald.</v>

1501
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:23.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He writes for Newsweek and tweeted that </v>

1502
01:04:25.921 --> 01:04:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump had been put in a mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution for some time,</v>

1503
01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:31.043
<v Speaker 2>no evidence for it whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took the tweet down pretty quickly </v>

1504
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:37.650
<v Speaker 2>when it was debunked but he wasn't fired</v>
<v Speaker 2>or or even suspend or even chastise.</v>

1505
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:40.770
<v Speaker 2>So this is where people talk about post </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

1506
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Now I know we don't want to be in a post</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth society what's post true,</v>

1507
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:45.283
<v Speaker 2>but we'll post truth that at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know any idiot who's amass the </v>

1508
01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:50.850
<v Speaker 2>150,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter followers,</v>

1509
01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:51.684
<v Speaker 2>it has as much influence in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>respects as news one on one was that </v>

1510
01:04:54.931 --> 01:04:57.500
<v Speaker 2>150,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>acre?</v>

1511
01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for calling me an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went above it.</v>

1512
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:00.624
<v Speaker 2>That's why I mentioned that number cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was any idiot that could have as much </v>

1513
01:05:02.851 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 2>influence but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really you could have a set,</v>

1514
01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:08.070
<v Speaker 2>you could figure out how to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media game and somehow because of</v>

1515
01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.230
<v Speaker 2>that you've got a little blue check to </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1516
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.243
<v Speaker 2>Now you're an authority on this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there so that I do see as a major </v>

1517
01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:18.850
<v Speaker 2>risk that while I wanted the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>media to get the lashing,</v>

1518
01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:19.684
<v Speaker 2>it deserved the fact that it's now </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's just picking their truth </v>

1519
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:24.610
<v Speaker 2>wherever they can find it.</v>

1520
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:26.380
<v Speaker 2>As a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1521
01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 2>it's both a problem and a blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also means that the,</v>

1522
01:05:29.771 --> 01:05:30.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1523
01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:32.380
<v Speaker 2>the traditional establishment media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be,</v>

1524
01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>can be gone around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1525
01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:36.130
<v Speaker 2>you can get your ideas out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1526
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.983
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nothing can stop you from </v>

1527
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.420
<v Speaker 2>communicating to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1528
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.313
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that anybody can communicate </v>

1529
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:44.800
<v Speaker 2>and whether or not he or she is </v>
<v Speaker 2>credible,</v>

1530
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:45.933
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is left to you as a consumer to figure </v>

1531
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:48.814
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any way that you think trump </v>

1532
01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>can reconcile this relationship with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>media?</v>

1533
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Because I think it's almost the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing right now.</v>

1534
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:55.594
<v Speaker 2>More important than the policies because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to just rail against the </v>

1535
01:05:58.181 --> 01:05:59.380
<v Speaker 2>media all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1536
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't like what the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream media has done,</v>

1537
01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:02.943
<v Speaker 2>but do you think you can get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he'll actually do some real sit </v>

1538
01:06:05.641 --> 01:06:06.474
<v Speaker 2>downs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do some real press conferences and not </v>

1539
01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:09.850
<v Speaker 2>do the same things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1540
01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:11.690
<v Speaker 2>be willing to sit down with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewer.</v>

1541
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:12.543
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it will be me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it will be somebody else and </v>

1542
01:06:13.871 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 2>not demand the questions in advance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1543
01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:19.150
<v Speaker 2>be better than all the reasons that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just said the Democrats.</v>

1544
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it donald trump's job to,</v>

1545
01:06:22.721 --> 01:06:24.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to curry favor with the media.</v>

1546
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:27.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the media's job to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1547
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:32.850
<v Speaker 2>and as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has very little risk.</v>

1548
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is disliked more than Reagan,</v>

1549
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:40.600
<v Speaker 2>more than George W.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush.</v>

1550
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

1551
01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:43.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're out to get him.</v>

1552
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:45.003
<v Speaker 2>And for him to have a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontational attitude towards the </v>

1553
01:06:47.141 --> 01:06:47.974
<v Speaker 2>media to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes perfect sense because there is no </v>

1554
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.353
<v Speaker 2>upside in him doing it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to go after him like </v>

1555
01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 2>nobody's business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

1556
01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.240
<v Speaker 2>they just like him because of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude about,</v>

1557
01:06:58.241 --> 01:06:58.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1558
01:06:58.830 --> 01:06:59.561
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1559
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:01.270
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1560
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 2>they think of him as a racist.</v>

1561
01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:04.720
<v Speaker 2>You think of him as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

1562
01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:05.501
<v Speaker 2>as a bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

1563
01:07:05.501 --> 01:07:06.334
<v Speaker 2>as a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's your attitude and you're not </v>

1564
01:07:09.161 --> 01:07:11.680
<v Speaker 2>going to cut me any slack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should I kiss your butt?</v>

1565
01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.290
<v Speaker 2>And so I have no problem with what Sean </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1566
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Sean Spicer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his first,</v>

1567
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>informal press conference when he,</v>

1568
01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:19.840
<v Speaker 2>when he blasted the media the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1569
01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.020
<v Speaker 2>And it does turn out that Donald Trump's</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

1570
01:07:23.021 --> 01:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>which is the word he used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1571
01:07:24.711 --> 01:07:27.310
<v Speaker 2>to watch the inaugural with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was bigger than any audience and history</v>

1572
01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:29.110
<v Speaker 2>in part because of social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1573
01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:31.360
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people on twitter were angry</v>
<v Speaker 2>me over that,</v>

1574
01:07:31.361 --> 01:07:32.194
<v Speaker 2>cause I didn't say anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you listen to actually what he </v>

1575
01:07:35.081 --> 01:07:35.770
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1576
01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:36.800
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning he,</v>

1577
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:38.890
<v Speaker 2>and then he clarified it on Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1578
01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are streaming it on facebook</v>

1579
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:42.570
<v Speaker 2>and watching on ipads and youtube and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

1580
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:45.550
<v Speaker 2>but everybody wants everyone to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>outraged all the time.</v>

1581
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:46.530
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1582
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It also turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>

1583
01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 2>that when you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1584
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:50.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1585
01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.330
<v Speaker 2>the pictures of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1586
01:07:52.331 --> 01:07:54.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama's inaugural and trump's,</v>

1587
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:55.923
<v Speaker 2>trump's does look thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my understanding is part of that is </v>

1588
01:07:58.151 --> 01:08:00.850
<v Speaker 2>because of security measures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain places you can't stand</v>

1589
01:08:00.851 --> 01:08:03.160
<v Speaker 2>anymore for in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go through anymore.</v>

1590
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.053
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people couldn't get to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>main area because of all these security </v>

1591
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 2>requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're comparing,</v>

1592
01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:08.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not apples to apples and so you'd agree </v>

1593
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:13.090
<v Speaker 2>all of that is just sideshow nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1594
01:08:13.091 --> 01:08:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Like it's actually completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>

1595
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>The amount of people I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1596
01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:18.554
<v Speaker 2>not the lying about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just whether they were x amount of </v>

1597
01:08:20.451 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 2>people or why it's completely irrelevant</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that he's putting media on notice</v>

1598
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:25.880
<v Speaker 2>that you have to be fair to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the media regrets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1600
01:08:28.190 --> 01:08:29.023
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to categorize all the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they look back at the way they </v>

1601
01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:34.040
<v Speaker 2>treated mccain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who now looks like the most moderate,</v>

1602
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:36.110
<v Speaker 2>the public and of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1603
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.033
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1604
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:38.660
<v Speaker 2>they were times calling him racist.</v>

1605
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.790
<v Speaker 2>And I think he has an adopted black </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter,</v>

1606
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:41.624
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or when they look at Romney and the </v>

1607
01:08:43.941 --> 01:08:46.130
<v Speaker 2>binders of women and made it sound like </v>
<v Speaker 2>he hates women,</v>

1608
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.600
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way,</v>

1609
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:52.430
<v Speaker 2>they created trump because any </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican was going to get the cries of</v>

1610
01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:53.264
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to get the cries of misogyny </v>

1611
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:56.900
<v Speaker 2>and the crisis xenophobia and homophobia</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>

1612
01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he brings up Peter Teal.</v>

1613
01:08:58.291 --> 01:09:00.820
<v Speaker 2>These still hates gays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a,</v>

1614
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Carson,</v>

1615
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 2>he's still lays black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a way,</v>

1616
01:09:03.621 --> 01:09:06.920
<v Speaker 2>he was the only answer to this absurd </v>
<v Speaker 2>equation,</v>

1617
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

1618
01:09:08.481 --> 01:09:10.820
<v Speaker 2>I think the media did they help to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create Donald Trump.</v>

1619
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.770
<v Speaker 2>People resent the idea that the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>has gone after Republicans in a way that</v>

1620
01:09:15.771 --> 01:09:19.100
<v Speaker 2>they not gone after Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a distrust.</v>

1621
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.113
<v Speaker 2>And when Donald Trump talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness and how he was no </v>

1622
01:09:22.971 --> 01:09:26.120
<v Speaker 2>longer going to be politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people took that to mean I'm no</v>

1623
01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:30.290
<v Speaker 2>longer going to going to thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself as a racist,</v>

1624
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:33.560
<v Speaker 2>as a sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply because I've got normal views and</v>

1625
01:09:33.561 --> 01:09:35.630
<v Speaker 2>normal ideas at any other guy has.</v>

1626
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>And I think Donald Trump has given </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like that a certain amount of,</v>

1627
01:09:39.151 --> 01:09:40.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of comfort and credibility.</v>

1628
01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1629
01:09:41.571 --> 01:09:42.404
<v Speaker 2>So one more for Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we'll sort of wrap this whole </v>

1630
01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 2>thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens over the next four years?</v>

1631
01:09:46.101 --> 01:09:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Where do you really see this all going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see this endless clash between,</v>

1632
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.313
<v Speaker 2>between trump and the left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way to get the media </v>

1633
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:54.223
<v Speaker 2>straightened out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we get some of this societal stuff </v>

1634
01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.693
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shake out or is it just going to be </v>

1635
01:09:58.941 --> 01:10:02.030
<v Speaker 2>more battling because it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought there was going to be a couple</v>

1636
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.710
<v Speaker 2>of days after the election where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone would take a breath.</v>

1637
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like everyone's just ramping up</v>

1638
01:10:05.931 --> 01:10:06.880
<v Speaker 2>more and more now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1639
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 2>people see things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We disagree.</v>

1640
01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Speaker 2>We disagree about abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We disagree about same sex marriage.</v>

1641
01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:12.950
<v Speaker 2>We disagree about taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about spending,</v>

1642
01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:14.000
<v Speaker 2>about foreign policy.</v>

1643
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.133
<v Speaker 2>As long as we have those disagreements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have these kinds of </v>

1644
01:10:16.491 --> 01:10:18.680
<v Speaker 2>disputes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think what will happen,</v>

1645
01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:19.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully,</v>

1646
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:22.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we have 4% GDP growth.</v>

1647
01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we did under Ronald Reagan.</v>

1648
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Ronald Reagan was overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>reelected,</v>

1649
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:26.803
<v Speaker 2>not because people agreed with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they disagreed with him about his </v>

1650
01:10:28.941 --> 01:10:31.370
<v Speaker 2>nuclear proliferation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They disagreed about,</v>

1651
01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.181
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1652
01:10:32.181 --> 01:10:33.014
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1653
01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.873
<v Speaker 2>going into South America and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll back some of the communists </v>

1654
01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.750
<v Speaker 2>movements there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go down and list by list,</v>

1655
01:10:38.751 --> 01:10:39.584
<v Speaker 2>it was a article in the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1986 I talked about all of these </v>

1656
01:10:43.131 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 2>points of views and how Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreed with Ronald Reagan,</v>

1657
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.753
<v Speaker 2>but they respected him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly reelected him because </v>

1658
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.740
<v Speaker 2>ultimately it comes down to the economy </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes down to pocket book and 70% of the</v>

1659
01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 2>American people felt that we were on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong track economically.</v>

1660
01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.453
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the primary reason in my </v>

1661
01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:00.554
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why Donald Trump won worst economic </v>

1662
01:11:02.031 --> 01:11:03.410
<v Speaker 2>recovery since 1949.</v>

1663
01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:06.890
<v Speaker 2>This has been a 2% recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The average recovery 3%.</v>

1664
01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:08.023
<v Speaker 2>And the difference between 2% and 3% is </v>
<v Speaker 2>1 million jobs times at length the </v>

1665
01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:11.534
<v Speaker 2>recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if Obama had done nothing had on is </v>

1666
01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:15.630
<v Speaker 2>putting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have 7 million more jobs than we have</v>

1667
01:11:15.631 --> 01:11:16.440
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1668
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.273
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did work on the buddy know we'd have </v>

1669
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 2>10 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morgan.</v>

1670
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
