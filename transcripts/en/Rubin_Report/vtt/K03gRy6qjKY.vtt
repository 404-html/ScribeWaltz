1
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as you guys know,</v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:04.344
<v Speaker 1>I've spent a lot of time on the Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 1>report talking about the current status </v>

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I've said many times,</v>

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.683
<v Speaker 1>I believe the regressive left the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people who use illiberal tactics to </v>

5
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:14.484
<v Speaker 1>silence those defending liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles to be the left's version of </v>

6
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't reign them in now,</v>

7
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:20.814
<v Speaker 1>then the left in America will end up as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fractured as the right evidence of the </v>

8
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>fractured right is everywhere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically every mainstream conservative,</v>

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>actively trying to stop the parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Front runner,</v>

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.243
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been a time when a front </v>

11
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>runner on either side was so hated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own party's establishment?</v>

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Not that I know of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and interestingly,</v>

13
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>this mess is actually of the gops own </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

14
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>They didn't see the rise of the tea </v>
<v Speaker 1>party until it was too late,</v>

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>which set the gop establishment against </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own base.</v>

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.713
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the tea partiers been willing to </v>

17
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the Republican party would be in</v>

18
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>a better state than the ideological mess</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in right now.</v>

19
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.553
<v Speaker 1>That didn't happen though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you couple of fractured right </v>

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.883
<v Speaker 1>with the rise of the regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who refused to talk honestly about </v>

21
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>issues like Islamic extremism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>

22
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>we now have the rise of Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before I continue,</v>

23
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>let me say a couple of positive things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Donald Trump.</v>

24
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I probably should have issued a trigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning there.</v>

26
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:20.964
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>getting your safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

28
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.873
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has absolutely exposed our robotic </v>

29
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:27.294
<v Speaker 1>politicians who are bought and sold by </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign contributors openly Mocking </v>

30
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.813
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton for showing up to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wedding because he gave her a donation </v>

31
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His message of a broken system corrupted</v>

32
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>by money is exactly the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders is saying.</v>

33
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.553
<v Speaker 1>Trump has also talked about America's </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful trade deals with China and Mexico </v>

34
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.723
<v Speaker 1>and promise to negotiate better ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually there's every reason to </v>

35
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>believe that he would be good at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>

36
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>making deals is what he has built his </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire on.</v>

37
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>People actually attack trump for having </v>
<v Speaker 1>his trump brand ties made in Mexico.</v>

38
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>But that actually proves his point about</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bad trade deals.</v>

39
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>He's making things to sell where cost is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap and profit will be maximum.</v>

40
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.433
<v Speaker 1>As an American businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing what's best for his business </v>

41
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.973
<v Speaker 1>by making ties in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the fault of the businessman </v>

42
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:16.914
<v Speaker 1>who uses the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the fault of the politicians who </v>

43
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.004
<v Speaker 1>set up the bad deals which enable it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump has also brought the issue of </v>

44
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>immigration to the front and center of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the debate.</v>

45
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>He says he'll build a wall and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico pay for it.</v>

46
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.363
<v Speaker 1>While I think that Mexico actually may </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up building the wall and paying for </v>

47
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>it to keep Americans out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he becomes president,</v>

48
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>he makes a serious populous point with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall.</v>

49
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Trump always says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we either have a country or we don't.</v>

50
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.173
<v Speaker 1>A wall in and of itself isn't racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may not be wise and it may not </v>

51
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:45.324
<v Speaker 1>address the real problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he talks in simple language </v>

52
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he scores points with many voters.</v>

53
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Having secure borders shouldn't be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>partisan issue,</v>

54
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>but because of our politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate,</v>

55
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.124
<v Speaker 1>it's become one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be for better border security </v>

56
00:02:58.591 --> 00:02:59.424
<v Speaker 1>and still not be a big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't be too hard to </v>

57
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

58
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:03.484
<v Speaker 1>he is also scored points with many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and talking about the spread of </v>

59
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Islamic extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While trump never takes the time to make</v>

60
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>the distinction between Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremism and the average Muslim person,</v>

61
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.733
<v Speaker 1>he scores points by even talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic extremism in the first place </v>

62
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>because the left in this country refuses</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do so.</v>

63
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>This failure on the left to tackle the </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic of Islamic extremism,</v>

64
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by linking doctrine with action,</v>

65
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>actually helps feed those like trump who</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in with easy answers with no nuance</v>

66
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>or real understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump sees an opening for an easy answer</v>

67
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:38.704
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like banning all Muslims from entry to </v>

68
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.654
<v Speaker 1>the country and he runs with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn on any cable news channel to see </v>

69
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the list of bad things about Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>

70
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.043
<v Speaker 1>We've heard them all before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm actually going to take a </v>

71
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>different road here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about what the real threat of</v>

72
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:52.414
<v Speaker 1>a Donald Trump presidency is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is a businessman making </v>

73
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>business decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a reality TV host.</v>

74
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Winning the world's biggest reality TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>show over the course of his presidential</v>

75
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump has made it clear that he will say</v>

76
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally anything just to be elected.</v>

77
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>He uses the media is need for clicks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>views to fuel his rise,</v>

78
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>knowing full well.</v>

79
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>The more outlandish his statements are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more clownish he acts,</v>

80
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 1>the more free tv time he's going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has mastered the age old adage.</v>

81
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:24.064
<v Speaker 1>Any publicity is good publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like trump for his lack of </v>

82
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.564
<v Speaker 1>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not what he says that they're </v>

83
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.713
<v Speaker 1>responding to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that he's saying nothing and </v>

84
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>everything at the same time without </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounding like a career politician.</v>

85
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Is He really against gay marriage now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he used to be for it,</v>

86
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>is he really against abortion now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he used to be pro choice,</v>

87
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what's in his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know what's in his head.</v>

88
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be the contestant who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get fired on the season finale.</v>

89
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.093
<v Speaker 1>Many people in this country want to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like America is winning again and trump </v>

90
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>has wisely use this notion to fuel his </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>

91
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does electing trump actually mean?</v>

92
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.583
<v Speaker 1>If he wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does anyone think he'll actually adhere </v>

93
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:08.284
<v Speaker 1>to the constitution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will he care about due process or </v>

94
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>respect the three branches of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government?</v>

95
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.653
<v Speaker 1>Will he sue reporters who investigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the White House where we get into a war </v>

96
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>over a mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retweet his gruff language and loose use</v>

97
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:21.814
<v Speaker 1>of facts or only the micro problem here </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the macro problem is that nobody </v>

98
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>really knows what this guy stands for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than winning,</v>

99
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's the real risk of a trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidency.</v>

100
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.833
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what the country will </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like after we elect someone who </v>

101
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>cares more about his own rules than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law of the land.</v>

102
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.431
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

103
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>starbucks will put merry Christmas back </v>
<v Speaker 1>on cups when he's president.</v>

104
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.583
<v Speaker 1>Does he know that the president doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to decide what a private company </v>

105
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>does with their products as a business </v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

106
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does know,</v>

107
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.513
<v Speaker 1>but as a presidential candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't care if winning at all costs </v>

108
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>for a temporary feel good moment is good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

109
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>then by</v>

110
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 2>all means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should vote for Donald trump,</v>

111
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.973
<v Speaker 2>but don't be fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're being sold a bill of goods by </v>

112
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>someone who only cares about making the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal when the product sucks.</v>

113
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.243
<v Speaker 2>Don't expect to get a refund.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is the author of </v>

114
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 2>gorilla mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lawyer,</v>

115

<v Speaker 2>tell me a little bit about your history,</v>

126
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:42.014
<v Speaker 2>where you come from and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what got you to write the book and </v>

127
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 2>then we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll dive into that.</v>

128
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

129
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:50.020
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a grew up small town kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flyover state,</v>

130
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>which everybody hates now because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all redneck,</v>

131
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 2>backwoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hateful,</v>

132
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:56.520
<v Speaker 2>bigoted people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I grateful I ever.</v>

133
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 2>It was that Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

134
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 2>so I grew up in the middle of Illinois </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nothing but corn fields and soy bean</v>

135
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 2>farms and I realized that I don't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

136
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I want to do something more with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

137
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Growing up I was also kind of a fat kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got bullied a lot,</v>

138
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 2>got picked on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I got into martial arts and started</v>

139
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.023
<v Speaker 2>sort of beating up the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullied me and created that little </v>

140
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 2>conflict cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got that out of my.</v>

141
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the bullied dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

142
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.623
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the bullied kid dream is </v>

143
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 2>that you get bullied for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See some martial arts.</v>

144
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 2>You kick some ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I got.</v>

145
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I got back in everybody but one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he went to prison for it,</v>

146
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.423
<v Speaker 2>so I was actually home when I was 22 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this guy went into the bathroom </v>

147
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 2>and I was going to go and just slam his </v>
<v Speaker 2>head and my friend goes,</v>

148
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:40.230
<v Speaker 2>what is wrong with you man?</v>

149
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>

150
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 2>This happened when you were like 13 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

151
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 now,</v>

152
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

153
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:45.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

154
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Got that out of my system.</v>

155
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.263
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because a lot of people do </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to repeat the things that happened </v>

156
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 2>to them when you were 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you were bullied people,</v>

157
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 2>they then become the bullies adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

158
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.693
<v Speaker 2>and that's probably why I hate bullies </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much now it's just you realize these </v>

159
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 2>people are trying to ruin lives and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>as bad as bad vibe when you're a kid.</v>

160
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't really like calling adults </v>
<v Speaker 2>being bullied.</v>

161
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an adult.</v>

162
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.930
<v Speaker 2>You should know how to or you're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>online bullied.</v>

163
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.833
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should learn how to kind of chill </v>

164
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:17.110
<v Speaker 2>out a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

165
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a lot of online bullying </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that goes on in terms of,</v>

166
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tweeted something wrong.</v>

167
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Let's ruin this guy's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get him fired from.</v>

168
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get the guy fired over.</v>

169
00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:27.704
<v Speaker 2>A tweet is probably worse than throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kindle locker room because that guy </v>

170
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:34.220
<v Speaker 2>has a family and that's his livelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or what happened with say,</v>

171
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Justine Sacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you can't find a job and like,</v>

172
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:39.920
<v Speaker 2>well maybe that is even a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

173
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.813
<v Speaker 2>Know what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

174
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.653
<v Speaker 2>so that's a little bit of a sidebar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just in case you want to just lay </v>

175
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:44.930
<v Speaker 2>that out because it was really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

176
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 2>nobody really knew who this woman was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She put out one tweet,</v>

177
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adjusting.</v>

178
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Soco is the best example of the outrage </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

179
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>She was a nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundred and 20 followers,</v>

180
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 2>all of her friends and she tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 2>heading to Africa,</v>

181
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 2>hope I don't get aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>

182
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm white,</v>

183
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 2>lol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

184
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Got a joke.</v>

185
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just stupid.</v>

186
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 2>She was a hipster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was actually trying to be ironic and</v>

187
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:10.674
<v Speaker 2>she gets on a plane for Africa back then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had have wifi on the plane to Africa </v>

188
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 2>and she's in the air and I shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>

189
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a tragic story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started a Hashtag.</v>

190
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Has Justine landed yet everybody now </v>
<v Speaker 2>hates justine sacco.</v>

191
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>She's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody said,</v>

192
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you mean by this?</v>

193
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

194
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 2>And to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody really knew who this person was.</v>

195
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 2>So this was just the perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet going crazy.</v>

196
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a nobody.</v>

197
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't a public figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't work in tech.</v>

198
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably one of her coworkers saw it and</v>

199
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do a little backstabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was somebody made personal drama,</v>

200
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.893
<v Speaker 2>international news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody went after her and it touches </v>

201
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 2>on so many themes were.</v>

202
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a woman.</v>

203
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 2>She was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rape threats are the people,</v>

204
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 2>the social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the activist.</v>

205
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 2>If you're leading a sort of hate mob on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman who gets raped,</v>

206
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 2>threats will wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what you say?</v>

207
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:02.370
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never done that.</v>

208
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 2>I would never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

209
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 2>so let's hold off on some of the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice stuff first,</v>

210
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:07.411
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

211
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to go on the record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not jump on that twitter bandwagon</v>

212
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Speaker 2>because I remember thinking this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

213
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Speaker 2>This is just some person who said some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid things,</v>

214
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:15.744
<v Speaker 2>so I can't be outraged by somebody I </v>
<v Speaker 2>never heard of until I saw this little </v>

215
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:19.014
<v Speaker 2>tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a little bit back to your history </v>

216
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:20.840
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll look up on some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

217
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then I was deciding on where to go to</v>

218
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 2>law school.</v>

219
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I looked at a map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

220
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.873
<v Speaker 2>I read that the data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data says you're gonna live within </v>

221
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 2>50 miles of where I go to law school </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistically speaking,</v>

222
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.333
<v Speaker 2>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if I go to law school in Illinois </v>

223
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 2>that means my life will be a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>strip on Illinois.</v>

224
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll move to California.</v>

225
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Kind of too big of a language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too afraid to go live in la to go to</v>

226
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 2>ucla because I was too big of a pussy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go live in La.</v>

227
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:48.534
<v Speaker 2>I'm a small town kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving on the 10 for the first </v>

228
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Oh shit,</v>

229
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do people,</v>

230
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.034
<v Speaker 2>how do people drive traffic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I figured that I could go to </v>

231
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:58.370
<v Speaker 2>pepperdine in Malibu and then I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of visit las.</v>

232
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Malibu is a very small town vibe.</v>

233
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Best of both worlds.</v>

234
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're right on the beach.</v>

235
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.094
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty sweet operation over there at </v>

236
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 2>pepperdine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

237
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 2>you know how it is wherever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't appreciate what you have first</v>

238
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 2>couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's magical.</v>

239
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.983
<v Speaker 2>Majestic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that you just look into the law </v>

240
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:16.100
<v Speaker 2>books anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

241
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

242
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.723
<v Speaker 2>so you became a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then really what put you into the </v>

243
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 2>public space was you wrote your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gorilla mindset.</v>

244
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very much a.</v>

245
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

246
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 2>my main takeaway is sort of that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>control your destiny is sort of the,</v>

247
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 2>the takeaway that I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what made you write it and is that,</v>

248
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:35.760
<v Speaker 2>do you think that's a fair assessment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

249
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see defined within certain confines,</v>

250
00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:40.040
<v Speaker 2>your own reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

251
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.810
<v Speaker 2>you're Dave Rubin on Mike Cernovich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your life is your life.</v>

252
00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:43.644
<v Speaker 2>My life is my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to have different </v>

253
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:47.910
<v Speaker 2>experiences in terms of how you live on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a day to day basis,</v>

254
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>but we got the same drama.</v>

255
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.250
<v Speaker 2>We're pissed off at people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't feel like we got recognition.</v>

256
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 2>We wonder if we're gonna lose our jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How am I gonna make money doing this.</v>

257
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.393
<v Speaker 2>What if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

258
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 2>ask that girl or guy out on a date or </v>
<v Speaker 2>what if they think I'm dumb.</v>

259
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.873
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid to go on TV because people </v>

260
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:04.930
<v Speaker 2>think I look stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sound funny.</v>

261
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 2>What if I say the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all got the same problems,</v>

262
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to pay my bill?</v>

263
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:12.250
<v Speaker 2>So ultimately you want to control your </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

264
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:14.770
<v Speaker 2>You want to control your emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to,</v>

265
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.743
<v Speaker 2>to not lose it essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I wrote this because I </v>

266
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 2>went through a lot of drama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a lot of,</v>

267
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grew up,</v>

268
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 2>you grew up poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're in the big city,</v>

269
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 2>you've got to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

270
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:26.134
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this in a lot of writing </v>

271
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people tend to be ashamed of their</v>

272
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.953
<v Speaker 2>upbringing.</v>

273
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>So instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

274
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I grew up a poor kid in a small town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>

275
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:36.461
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I am.</v>

276
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Now you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

277
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.633
<v Speaker 2>I hate rednecks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because you want to get away from </v>

278
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:42.184
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

279
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.280
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of overreact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well why is that?</v>

280
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.253
<v Speaker 2>Because your mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the way you're framing your </v>

281
00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:48.910
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we tend to do is we think,</v>

282
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up this poor dumb kid.</v>

283
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Why would I ever do with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can just say what I mean.</v>

284
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I grew up a poor dumb kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

285
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.263
<v Speaker 2>I made it somehow I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned and I've grown and I start </v>

286
00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 2>to take these background experiences and</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a new future out of those.</v>

287
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting the way we sort of </v>

288
00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:07.484
<v Speaker 1>fetishize being the recipient of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying or being the recipient of sort </v>

289
00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:13.784
<v Speaker 1>of anything bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think for me I was bullied as much </v>

290
00:13:17.181 --> 00:13:19.340
<v Speaker 1>as I bullied other kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

291
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some kids that I probably bullet,</v>

292
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the word either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

293
00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:24.380
<v Speaker 1>it's so played out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even mean anything,</v>

294
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but I probably treated some kids pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty and the,</v>

295
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.363
<v Speaker 1>the kids that were higher on the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in high school treated me pretty </v>

296
00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:32.840
<v Speaker 1>shitty and here I am so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so big wheel,</v>

297
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.883
<v Speaker 1>big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have this idea somehow that if </v>

298
00:13:35.421 --> 00:13:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you're always on the recipient end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

299
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.713
<v Speaker 1>but somehow your better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really bizarre thing and I </v>

300
00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:42.590
<v Speaker 1>guess that goes to the heart of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

301
00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:44.480
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the one to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

302
00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be bullied anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

303
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:47.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

304
00:13:47.001 --> 00:13:47.834
<v Speaker 2>we ultimately define our realities based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on other people and there's a lot of </v>

305
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:53.510
<v Speaker 2>reasons for that and we should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I teach you don't do that.</v>

306
00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:55.430
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame.</v>

307
00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.680
<v Speaker 2>We've all been ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

308
00:13:57.681 --> 00:13:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

309
00:13:58.791 --> 00:13:59.720
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

310
00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.660
<v Speaker 2>some complete stranger thinks you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot,</v>

311
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:03.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

312
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.410
<v Speaker 2>why are you letting that other person to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find your own reality?</v>

313
00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Which is what you do when you let people</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame you,</v>

314
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.650
<v Speaker 2>attack you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of bullying you.</v>

315
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.710
<v Speaker 2>You're now saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

316
00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to let other people control </v>
<v Speaker 2>how I feel.</v>

317
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.920
<v Speaker 2>And then he started to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

318
00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.750
<v Speaker 2>why would I let other people control how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel?</v>

319
00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:20.970
<v Speaker 2>How does this make any sense of my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he start to reframe that,</v>

320
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:24.260
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to a stronger mindset.</v>

321
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that concept is very much in line </v>

322
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:28.284
<v Speaker 1>with the online culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know you're a big part of this </v>

323
00:14:29.881 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Speaker 1>because I see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see you fighting with people online.</v>

324
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.800
<v Speaker 1>You're calling people out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are attacking you.</v>

325
00:14:34.801 --> 00:14:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really in it,</v>

326
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.460
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sort of like back and forth piece</v>

327
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

328
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.703
<v Speaker 1>so I guess the way you deal with that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you just don't take any of it too </v>

329
00:14:43.561 --> 00:14:44.330
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

330
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.790
<v Speaker 2>You can't take them personally and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>always have to.</v>

331
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.220
<v Speaker 2>You always got to take a negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>rifampin.</v>

332
00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reframe it as a positive it cliche,</v>

333
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 2>but you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

334
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I have all these people saying mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>things about me.</v>

335
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Or You could just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

336
00:14:57.321 --> 00:14:58.154
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do these idiots that I've never </v>

337
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:01.800
<v Speaker 2>heard of hear about me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

338
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I must be doing something right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be making impact.</v>

339
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:09.080
<v Speaker 2>So you can let criticism define you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madonna said this one's actually,</v>

340
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:09.914
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I go into a room and there are 100 </v>

341
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.570
<v Speaker 2>people and 99 people like me and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>person doesn't,</v>

342
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 2>that one person who doesn't like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what sticks with me.</v>

343
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.633
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to be hardwired as human beings </v>

344
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.073
<v Speaker 2>to let criticism bother us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes sense because if we're </v>

345
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:26.570
<v Speaker 2>living in a small tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>150 people there,</v>

346
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.270
<v Speaker 2>if five guys don't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

347
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.720
<v Speaker 2>they might take you out on the hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>trip and kill you.</v>

348
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.553
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're not in that environment </v>

349
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a big global environment.</v>

350
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I've even written about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.440
<v Speaker 2>you just have to niche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

352
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 2>if 99 percent of the world hates me one </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent like me,</v>

353
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.040
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be filthy rich.</v>

354
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 2>That would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

355
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:46.214
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to have 99 percent of the </v>

356
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:48.194
<v Speaker 2>world hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's always reminds me of the </v>

357
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:54.971
<v Speaker 2>thing from Howard Stern's book and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie when they're talking about the</v>

358
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.260
<v Speaker 2>executives are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:58.094
<v Speaker 2>the people that like you watch you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>four minutes and the people that hate </v>

360
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:03.680
<v Speaker 2>you watch or listen to you for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours or something.</v>

361
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.573
<v Speaker 2>Well my haters dredge up posts that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote maybe when I was in a bad mood or </v>

362
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:09.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll,</v>

363
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you guys find this stuff?</v>

364
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:12.764
<v Speaker 2>Or they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll cite confronting you with </v>

365
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:14.250
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

366
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.081
<v Speaker 2>I know you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

367
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are great.</v>

368
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 2>You're pulling up these archives that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even remember.</v>

369
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good,</v>

370
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:21.824
<v Speaker 2>a good transition for everything I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going on in the country right </v>

371
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:25.484
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everyone's outraged all the </v>

372
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all offended all the time.</v>

373
00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 2>We're looking for people to attack all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

374
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Incomes Donald trump into this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're a Donald Trump supporter,</v>

375
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

376
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Endorsed Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>endorsed Donald Trump.</v>

377
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.013
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe you're the first trump </v>

378
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:43.580
<v Speaker 2>supporter that I've had on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So congratulations on that.</v>

379
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:44.583
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shared my feelings at the beginning </v>

380
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:46.214
<v Speaker 2>about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before I give you more of my </v>

381
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:48.404
<v Speaker 2>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so give me why is this working for </v>

382
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:52.440
<v Speaker 2>trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truth working like them or not this.</v>

383
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's reading that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

384
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 2>So when you have a reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a counter reaction.</v>

385
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Here's the world we live in.</v>

386
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 2>You're a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a reasonable guy.</v>

387
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not most liberals that just,</v>

388
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 2>not sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you on that.</v>

389
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>That's just reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've now taken God who's dead.</v>

390
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:12.254
<v Speaker 2>We don't have religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We now have the religion of political </v>

391
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:14.954
<v Speaker 2>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The liberals have now turned into a </v>

392
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 2>religion where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say,</v>

393
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe these things.</v>

394
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're wrong.</v>

395
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if we talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get through to you.</v>

396
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I don't even look at how you live.</v>

397
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 2>You make a bad tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your evil,</v>

398
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.100
<v Speaker 2>you think something about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bad person.</v>

399
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:32.720
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always use an example of,</v>

400
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people have facebook drama</v>

401
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 2>by people who knew him and this happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

402
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 2>so we know this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great guy,</v>

403
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:43.070
<v Speaker 2>he's actually liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these liberal friends and he posted,</v>

404
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.563
<v Speaker 2>you know guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's weird that Bruce </v>

405
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Jenner now like as a woman and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Caitlin.</v>

406
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's really weird that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would want to do that.</v>

407
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 2>And his friends were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

408
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:56.790
<v Speaker 2>you're transphobic big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you said this.</v>

409
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 2>They were texting back channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought this was a good person,</v>

410
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

411
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 2>This is a guy who you've only known to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a decent guy for all time.</v>

412
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 2>He says something that probably a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are actually thinking privately.</v>

413
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something I want to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

414
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I know Trans People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trans people are our great people.</v>

415
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:15.024
<v Speaker 2>I have obviously no issue with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somebody could say that and that in </v>

416
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 2>and of itself doesn't make them a well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm weird.</v>

417
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 2>You're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want to be on TV?</v>

418
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do I have a podcast?</v>

419
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Why do I troll the Internet bullied when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was right?</v>

420
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.033
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this concept that if you live a </v>

421
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:32.034
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle that is deviant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deviant doesn't necessarily always mean </v>

422
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

423
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Weird doesn't mean a moral judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just means wow,</v>

424
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 2>that's out of the realm of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

425
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.203
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people saw what I did early on </v>

426
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 2>before I caught on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

427
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:45.174
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust me,</v>

428
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.310
<v Speaker 2>like I know what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're like,</v>

429
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:48.300
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on twitter.</v>

430
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:50.160
<v Speaker 2>You're just a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are people going to think?</v>

431
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just try.</v>

432
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 2>But if people said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>

433
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a waste of time.</v>

434
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

435
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.420
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

436
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.690
<v Speaker 2>You're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it right now.</v>

437
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're a bad person for </v>
<v Speaker 2>making that judgment,</v>

438
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:06.970
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of times we want to now think </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is a character attack when,</v>

439
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 2>when ultimately you're just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

440
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:09.144
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really understand it and what </v>

441
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.460
<v Speaker 2>you do when somebody doesn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and you say,</v>

442
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 2>well actually I mean is gender binary?</v>

443
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.733
<v Speaker 2>What about brain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you get into other issues too </v>

444
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:20.484
<v Speaker 2>where you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

445
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Speaker 2>I thought gender is a social construct </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there is no male female brain,</v>

446
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.130
<v Speaker 2>but if there's no male brain and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>female brain,</v>

447
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 2>then how can I be a male body with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>female brain?</v>

448
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard to extrapolate all that on</v>

449
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:33.420
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead people are just like,</v>

450
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.440
<v Speaker 2>you hate everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

451
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.880
<v Speaker 2>So the interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll get back.</v>

452
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.490
<v Speaker 2>The trouble with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Trans situation is that,</v>

453
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caitlyn Jenner,</v>

454
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:47.490
<v Speaker 2>now people are turning the left is </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning on her now because she said that</v>

455
00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:50.400
<v Speaker 2>she's supporting Ted Cruz and I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

456
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.243
<v Speaker 2>I've never watched any of that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did watch the little five minute </v>

457
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.420
<v Speaker 2>part where she was sort of defending why</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a Republican and you know,</v>

458
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.790
<v Speaker 2>they're debating and the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.633
<v Speaker 2>she's arguing with these housewives or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever these people are that have no </v>

460
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:02.424
<v Speaker 2>idea what they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen now people on the left </v>

461
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>turning on her because she has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different political view.</v>

462
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Speaker 2>So two months ago she was a hero to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

463
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.600
<v Speaker 2>But now you think differently </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>

464
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.300
<v Speaker 2>so now you're evil and that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger there.</v>

465
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll confess that I did watch the </v>

466
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:18.414
<v Speaker 2>show for research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll call her research Sherita and a </v>

467
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Caitlin's position was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

468
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 2>we're 7 trillion in debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

469
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.933
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be able to use the same </v>

470
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:31.680
<v Speaker 2>restrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but come on like if the country falls,</v>

471
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 2>everybody's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

472
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't even that the views are </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

473
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 2>the views are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

474
00:20:38.101 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm focused on bigger issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

475
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 2>what happens to a country if our economy</v>
<v Speaker 2>collapses,</v>

476
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.033
<v Speaker 2>well you're going to have a lot bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>worries then can you use the unisex </v>

477
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 2>bathroom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>

478
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 2>But people know they don't want to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

479
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 2>So what happens now is you get fixated </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this marginal issue.</v>

480
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.413
<v Speaker 2>There's this issue that only affects a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real small group of people and then </v>

481
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to focus on any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues or else you're evil.</v>

482
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Caitlin would say,</v>

483
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:06.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support Ted Cruz.</v>

484
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Ted Cruz is wrong about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>

485
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:12.430
<v Speaker 2>we got really bigger issues and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you a bad person.</v>

486
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.323
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the person that loves identity </v>

487
00:21:14.241 --> 00:21:16.880
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like a real disconnect for them,</v>

488
00:21:16.881 --> 00:21:17.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're like,</v>

489
00:21:17.961 --> 00:21:18.890
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

490
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.963
<v Speaker 1>your trans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that you're supposed to </v>

491
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:24.650
<v Speaker 1>care about most of these trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here you have someone saying,</v>

492
00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.390
<v Speaker 1>well actually I care more about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy or security or whatever it is.</v>

493
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.140
<v Speaker 1>And identity politics as I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>widows us down to the point where if you</v>

494
00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:36.080
<v Speaker 1>jump out of that little box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people start freaking out.</v>

495
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what everybody says now,</v>

496
00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a white,</v>

497
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.830
<v Speaker 2>straight CIS man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my experienced this,</v>

498
00:21:42.831 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and will as a gay man,</v>

499
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.950
<v Speaker 2>my experiences as an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a.</v>

500
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.263
<v Speaker 2>So we've taken this sort of personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative and now we treat that as like </v>

501
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.500
<v Speaker 2>absolute reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no issue other than your narrow</v>

502
00:21:54.501 --> 00:21:57.080
<v Speaker 2>slice of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that is not.</v>

503
00:21:57.081 --> 00:21:57.914
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a fun way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why anybody would want to </v>

504
00:21:59.511 --> 00:22:02.180
<v Speaker 2>live that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very narcissistic,</v>

505
00:22:02.181 --> 00:22:05.120
<v Speaker 2>narrow view on the world where what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do is you want to think,</v>

506
00:22:05.121 --> 00:22:06.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of us.</v>

507
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.530
<v Speaker 2>We live in a pluralistic society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got gays,</v>

508
00:22:09.531 --> 00:22:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>

509
00:22:10.461 --> 00:22:11.660
<v Speaker 2>blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whites,</v>

510
00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.553
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we just figure out how to get </v>

511
00:22:14.871 --> 00:22:16.880
<v Speaker 2>along because we're stuck here together.</v>

512
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.753
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost as if all of those </v>

513
00:22:18.811 --> 00:22:19.644
<v Speaker 1>groups that you decided have people </v>
<v Speaker 1>within them who think different things </v>

514
00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:22.741
<v Speaker 1>than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

515
00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:23.574
<v Speaker 1>the bigger group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that's such a </v>

516
00:22:24.481 --> 00:22:27.150
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be for a lot of people.</v>

517
00:22:27.151 --> 00:22:28.350
<v Speaker 1>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started here with trump.</v>

518
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we got over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

519
00:22:29.791 --> 00:22:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you take all of this,</v>

520
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this social justice stuff and this fear </v>

521
00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:37.830
<v Speaker 1>of saying what you think and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that basically has led us to trump,</v>

522
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:38.251
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

523
00:22:38.251 --> 00:22:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Because trump says anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what people say,</v>

524
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 2>why do you like trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they'll say what's,</v>

525
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.520
<v Speaker 2>what's on his mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people go,</v>

526
00:22:44.521 --> 00:22:45.354
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we say what's on our mind when we tell </v>

527
00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:49.110
<v Speaker 2>you that if you're a white man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate everybody,</v>

528
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're vague it.</v>

529
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.151
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

530
00:22:51.151 --> 00:22:54.780
<v Speaker 2>And now you have the counterculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Countercultures will trump is just going</v>

531
00:22:54.781 --> 00:22:58.440
<v Speaker 2>to say whatever's on his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's counter to your narrative.</v>

532
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.840
<v Speaker 2>And people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People respect it.</v>

533
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm with you on that portion of that </v>

534
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.980
<v Speaker 1>piece of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

535
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate political correctness.</v>

536
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.420
<v Speaker 1>The whole show has been devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting it.</v>

537
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.590
<v Speaker 1>So I understand that portion of it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

538
00:23:13.591 --> 00:23:14.720
<v Speaker 1>But I think you just said something </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

539
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.733
<v Speaker 1>He'll say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I see the biggest </v>

540
00:23:17.661 --> 00:23:19.100
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

541
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.791
<v Speaker 1>people keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

542
00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I like him because they'll say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's also saying nothing.</v>

543
00:23:22.281 --> 00:23:25.490
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taken every position on everything.</v>

544
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:26.503
<v Speaker 1>He watched him in the debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stands now for things he used to be </v>

545
00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:31.160
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many ways he's,</v>

546
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.053
<v Speaker 1>he's actually for big government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He certainly not a conservative all of </v>

547
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.290
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that enough for you?</v>

548
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:38.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the part that I just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

549
00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I get people are on it on the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

550
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.200
<v Speaker 1>but is that in and of itself enough for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to vote for somebody and be like,</v>

551
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.210
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

552
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about people first.</v>

553
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people first,</v>

554
00:23:49.781 --> 00:23:51.730
<v Speaker 2>everybody now knows people lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

555
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.193
<v Speaker 2>Obama said in the debates what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight years ago he was asked if he </v>

556
00:23:55.991 --> 00:23:58.000
<v Speaker 2>supported gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he say?</v>

557
00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't at the time,</v>

558
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.230
<v Speaker 2>but he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know we did.</v>

559
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know,</v>

560
00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:02.944
<v Speaker 2>we all know that Obama isn't a Muslim or</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know the obamas almost certainly </v>

561
00:24:05.801 --> 00:24:09.100
<v Speaker 2>agnostic is certainly not a Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's almost certainly not a Christian.</v>

562
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.800
<v Speaker 2>We all knew in those debates he </v>
<v Speaker 2>supported gay marriage,</v>

563
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.220
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the ruse.</v>

564
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.260
<v Speaker 2>It's all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know they're all liars.</v>

565
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.140
<v Speaker 2>They're all scammers there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Obama's drone struck.</v>

566
00:24:20.141 --> 00:24:22.510
<v Speaker 2>People killed all kinds of innocent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

567
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.523
<v Speaker 2>Those wars keep going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a single Wall Street executive has </v>

568
00:24:26.111 --> 00:24:27.910
<v Speaker 2>been indicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know of Clinton.</v>

569
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tough on Wall Street.</v>

570
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.470
<v Speaker 2>We know not a single person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know it's bullshit.</v>

571
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.400
<v Speaker 2>We all know it's a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then what happens is if it's a scam,</v>

572
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:37.923
<v Speaker 2>well then you just go with the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>showman and that's where we are now in </v>

573
00:24:40.241 --> 00:24:42.070
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go with the best show.</v>

574
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.210
<v Speaker 2>That's people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

575
00:24:43.211 --> 00:24:44.044
<v Speaker 2>me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I think trump is ultimately </v>

576
00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this could be my own delusions,</v>

577
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.493
<v Speaker 2>but my views and trump's are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar in that I'm a libertarian with </v>

578
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:55.743
<v Speaker 2>nationalist tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that means is you got to close </v>

579
00:24:57.701 --> 00:24:59.860
<v Speaker 2>the border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to make sure the right people</v>

580
00:24:59.861 --> 00:25:00.694
<v Speaker 2>get in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't let intolerant people in and </v>

581
00:25:02.831 --> 00:25:06.550
<v Speaker 2>then large amounts of social freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the country,</v>

582
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.690
<v Speaker 2>and that's always been trump's position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said.</v>

583
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is a liberal on this.</v>

584
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Of course he is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is if you live in a society where people</v>

585
00:25:13.751 --> 00:25:16.780
<v Speaker 2>can kind of get along and you lead them </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right people,</v>

586
00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.670
<v Speaker 2>then you can be socially liberal.</v>

587
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.653
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that the ends justify </v>

588
00:25:21.191 --> 00:25:23.380
<v Speaker 1>the means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that that's where I'm struggling</v>

589
00:25:23.381 --> 00:25:26.770
<v Speaker 1>with this situation with him because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that ultimately,</v>

590
00:25:26.771 --> 00:25:28.120
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I said at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

591
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.193
<v Speaker 1>if he got in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not someone who would respect </v>

592
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.553
<v Speaker 1>any law that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would accept that the </v>

593
00:25:35.831 --> 00:25:36.664
<v Speaker 1>executive branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the president is only one third of </v>

594
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:42.340
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he would do whatever he wants.</v>

595
00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:44.290
<v Speaker 1>The example I gave is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

596
00:25:44.291 --> 00:25:45.880
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he says anything,</v>

597
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.020
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to,</v>

598
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:47.883
<v Speaker 1>when I'm president of starbucks is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put merry Christmas back on Chris on </v>

599
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.100
<v Speaker 1>their coffee cups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a car.</v>

600
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that I got you already.</v>

601
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's just saying something crazy.</v>

602
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.840
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that line of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually dangerous.</v>

603
00:26:01.841 --> 00:26:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what leads us to fascism when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a guy who comes in and says,</v>

604
00:26:06.041 --> 00:26:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do whatever I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

605
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:08.680
<v Speaker 1>he's telling us right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

606
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.621
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

607
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 2>one of my specialties that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>common law.</v>

608
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.733
<v Speaker 2>The three branches of government issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned who has the power to declare </v>

609
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:16.154
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sole power to declare war congress </v>

610
00:26:18.351 --> 00:26:19.184
<v Speaker 2>has the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many words that we had since World </v>

611
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:22.050
<v Speaker 2>War Two?</v>

612
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 15.</v>

613
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.390
<v Speaker 2>How many times?</v>
<v Speaker 2>600.</v>

614
00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times is Congress declared war,</v>

615
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably once or.</v>

616
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't happened.</v>

617
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.450
<v Speaker 2>So we've had Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea war,</v>

618
00:26:33.451 --> 00:26:34.800
<v Speaker 2>a police action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

619
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>the Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first one,</v>

620
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 2>the second Iraq war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>

621
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.980
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Libya,</v>

622
00:26:39.981 --> 00:26:40.814
<v Speaker 2>which Obama did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The executive hasn't respected the </v>

623
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:44.874
<v Speaker 2>legislative branch for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is that you can </v>

624
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:48.024
<v Speaker 2>go back to before Obama was elected and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see liberal saying we have an </v>

625
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:54.480
<v Speaker 2>executive out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sub,</v>

626
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when Obama was elected,</v>

627
00:26:57.031 --> 00:26:59.790
<v Speaker 2>the Conservatives at the Cato Institute </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody like Obama's,</v>

628
00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of control and,</v>

629
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 2>but they all flip flopped on the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

630
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:05.064
<v Speaker 2>as a constitutional law school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually am a constitutional law </v>

631
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 2>scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all bullshit.</v>

632
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>

633
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:13.050
<v Speaker 2>everybody flip flops on who now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>

634
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 2>what can you really do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

635
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.823
<v Speaker 2>You can't really do that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea that the president is </v>

636
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:21.840
<v Speaker 2>that powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be stopped.</v>

637
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.940
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning what?</v>

638
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.833
<v Speaker 2>Meaning he's the really crazy stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think you're not going to round </v>

639
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 2>up 12 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

640
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.890
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to create a federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>police force.</v>

641
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Round up 12 million people start kicking</v>
<v Speaker 2>down doors.</v>

642
00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.240
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

643
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

644
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:40.680
<v Speaker 2>and actually I don't think that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he wants also,</v>

645
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 2>but he's saying that's what I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

646
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.863
<v Speaker 2>this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just follow the ideas of what he </v>

647
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.330
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this leads us to a bad place.</v>

648
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 2>This is a no defense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment and I get it.</v>

649
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I have given Obama Shit on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're bombing Syria right as we sit here</v>

650
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.450
<v Speaker 2>with no congressional authorization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I get it.</v>

651
00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.493
<v Speaker 2>They all do this terrible stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the through line of the </v>

652
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:05.280
<v Speaker 2>trump thinking leads us to a guy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years later who,</v>

653
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:07.740
<v Speaker 2>who will be next that that's what I fear</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

654
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Who will be next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

655
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.513
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is I wish I could see </v>

656
00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:13.944
<v Speaker 2>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if trump actually does a great </v>

657
00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:16.734
<v Speaker 2>job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if trump actually takes on Wall </v>

658
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:18.504
<v Speaker 2>Street?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if trump does solve the problem </v>

659
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:22.980
<v Speaker 2>with the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a problem.</v>

660
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Our social services our way over stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we,</v>

661
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:27.523
<v Speaker 2>we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who's ever gone to an er in </v>

662
00:28:28.801 --> 00:28:31.680
<v Speaker 2>California talk to any er doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

663
00:28:31.681 --> 00:28:34.770
<v Speaker 2>It is a real mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what trump is doing is he's setting a</v>

664
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 2>cultural town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just saying,</v>

665
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:38.220
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to figure this stuff out,</v>

666
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we need to do.</v>

667
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adults need to sit down at the table and</v>

668
00:28:43.501 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 2>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

669
00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 2>we have illegal immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do?</v>

670
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:47.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the path that everybody is taken is to </v>

671
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:49.831
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

672
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:51.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe amnesty,</v>

673
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a path decisions chip,</v>

674
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe this and maybe it will clear up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the border and maybe we'll do this.</v>

675
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

676
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:02.520
<v Speaker 2>it's time to actually take an extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>position because what happens,</v>

677
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:03.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The overton,</v>

678
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiation.</v>

679
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.850
<v Speaker 2>How much do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

680
00:29:05.851 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I want a billion dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're out of your mind,</v>

681
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 2>but now you've anchored and and all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is cognitive bias persuasion,</v>

682
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.230
<v Speaker 2>the anchoring bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

683
00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:16.080
<v Speaker 2>He's very open about this by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how he would negotiate.</v>

684
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just staking out something crazy.</v>

685
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.313
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there've been all these studies </v>

686
00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:21.540
<v Speaker 2>that'll show if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

687
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:24.930
<v Speaker 2>how many books do you think we're in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>library of Alexandria?</v>

688
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Twenty million or 1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

689
00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:29.250
<v Speaker 2>depending on if I say 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say,</v>

690
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 2>do you think there was 20 million or </v>
<v Speaker 2>more?</v>

691
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:31.321
<v Speaker 2>You'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

692
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I think there was 30 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

693
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.100
<v Speaker 2>But if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

694
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.943
<v Speaker 2>do you think there was more than 1 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million or less than a million books in </v>

695
00:29:36.961 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

696
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.560
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be closer to a million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All because of the anchoring.</v>

697
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Cognitive bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trump is just creating an anchor,</v>

698
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:44.643
<v Speaker 2>a really strong anchor point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then from there you work your way </v>

699
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 2>down and most people don't do that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your real life.</v>

700
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Most people you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

701
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.353
<v Speaker 2>I want this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I better ask for a salary pretty </v>

702
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 2>close to what I think they'll give me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asked for 50 percent more,</v>

703
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not going to say,</v>

704
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've asked her way too much,</v>

705
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.023
<v Speaker 2>would you just not get hired at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've anchored or bigger number on </v>

706
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:09.520
<v Speaker 2>them and now you have a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage and then you work from there.</v>

707
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.613
<v Speaker 1>So interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what trump is doing in certain way is </v>

708
00:30:12.261 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 1>really what people on the left do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is used feeling over Faq.</v>

709
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.470
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think you're defending him on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact based stuff.</v>

710
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all emotional,</v>

711
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.813
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're defending him on the emotional </v>

712
00:30:22.651 --> 00:30:23.400
<v Speaker 1>based stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

713
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.490
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating because I see people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the right all the time.</v>

714
00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Say I had Ben Shapiro who sat in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chair a couple of weeks ago saying,</v>

715
00:30:29.371 --> 00:30:30.204
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people on the left care about </v>

716
00:30:31.831 --> 00:30:34.980
<v Speaker 1>feeling more than fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you're saying basically is that</v>

717
00:30:34.981 --> 00:30:38.280
<v Speaker 1>trump is using that very tactic and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's running.</v>

718
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the right so by all humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

719
00:30:41.451 --> 00:30:42.284
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really should be running on the left </v>

720
00:30:43.291 --> 00:30:46.140
<v Speaker 1>and then they would all love him because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's giving them field.</v>

721
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.510
<v Speaker 1>If it was just the feel good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they feel good about it,</v>

722
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.620
<v Speaker 1>he's just giving the people on the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they feel good about.</v>

723
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm Ted Cruz and I'm a constitutionalist</v>
<v Speaker 2>who believes in liberty and the founding</v>

724
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:57.124
<v Speaker 2>fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

725
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.143
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a logical statement there that </v>

726
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:01.114
<v Speaker 2>you can analyze?</v>

727
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believes in liberty and that he </v>

728
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:03.740
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want people to marry who they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

729
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does Liberty Nice.</v>

730
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberty as you imposed,</v>

731
00:31:06.951 --> 00:31:10.560
<v Speaker 2>there was a great scene in Magnolia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that musical movie,</v>

732
00:31:10.561 --> 00:31:12.680
<v Speaker 2>and they go liberty fraternity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

733
00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:14.250
<v Speaker 2>who could oppose liberty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

734
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.133
<v Speaker 2>We all do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have a different conception of </v>

735
00:31:16.071 --> 00:31:18.950
<v Speaker 2>liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm a fundamentalist Christian,</v>

736
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.963
<v Speaker 2>well I want religious liberty and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think religious liberty means I </v>

737
00:31:22.251 --> 00:31:24.410
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have to bake a cake for gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were okay.</v>

738
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.610
<v Speaker 2>If you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

739
00:31:25.611 --> 00:31:26.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an adult.</v>

740
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:27.463
<v Speaker 2>I should be able to enter into contracts</v>
<v Speaker 2>about my relationship with other </v>

741
00:31:30.981 --> 00:31:32.940
<v Speaker 2>consenting adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I just say,</v>

742
00:31:32.941 --> 00:31:33.774
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support liberty.</v>

743
00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.210
<v Speaker 2>So then what'd you do as you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

744
00:31:35.211 --> 00:31:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Ted Cruz doesn't really support my </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception of liberty,</v>

745
00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support the constitution.</v>

746
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that even mean?</v>

747
00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot in the constitution.</v>

748
00:31:45.351 --> 00:31:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe abortion is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution or not?</v>

749
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it protect?</v>

750
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.073
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that politicians run on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these logical points and that people </v>

751
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.940
<v Speaker 2>make their conclusions based on logic is</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>

752
00:31:58.941 --> 00:31:59.774
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is funny when people facts over </v>

753
00:32:00.921 --> 00:32:02.600
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

754
00:32:02.601 --> 00:32:03.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

755
00:32:03.561 --> 00:32:06.320
<v Speaker 2>not to get too far ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that Michelle fields incident.</v>

756
00:32:06.321 --> 00:32:07.190
<v Speaker 2>We just had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

757
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.340
<v Speaker 2>oh I was grabbed and almost thrown to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground and this man.</v>

758
00:32:10.341 --> 00:32:12.440
<v Speaker 2>And then you watched the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

759
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.733
<v Speaker 1>it's still unclear to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for people that don't know what </v>

760
00:32:14.701 --> 00:32:15.534
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically trump's campaign manager </v>

761
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.210
<v Speaker 1>apparently grabbed Michelle fields who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a breitbart reporter.</v>

762
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.940
<v Speaker 1>She showed a little bit of a bruise on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her arm in a picture.</v>

763
00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I've watched the video a thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still,</v>

764
00:32:25.741 --> 00:32:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

765
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.160
<v Speaker 1>I've been in those scrums a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been to those things.</v>

766
00:32:29.161 --> 00:32:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get people get pushed and pulled and</v>

767
00:32:30.841 --> 00:32:32.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really know what happened.</v>

768
00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:33.120
<v Speaker 1>So I'll leave it there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>

769
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.360
<v Speaker 1>But your basic take on it is that she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bullshit artist.</v>

770
00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:37.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>

771
00:32:37.131 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>It's all been overplayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She sat on TV.</v>

772
00:32:39.981 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than my dad dying.</v>

773
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>This is the worst thing that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to me in my life.</v>

774
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every.</v>

775
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.323
<v Speaker 2>C'Mon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody uses feelings to manipulate </v>

776
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:50.180
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

777
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're about to be fired from a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make two cases.</v>

778
00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:54.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

779
00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:54.914
<v Speaker 2>here's an excel sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's how many of you as I bring you </v>

780
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:56.924
<v Speaker 2>can bring that into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we go way back and you promised me </v>

781
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 2>this last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All emotions,</v>

782
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.603
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make most of our decisions based on </v>

783
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:04.184
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We respect leaders based on we're </v>

784
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 2>monkeys were fucking monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

785
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:09.703
<v Speaker 2>We want to think we're better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Donald Trump right now is the big </v>

786
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Alpha Monkey.</v>

787
00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:14.763
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about the Alpha part </v>

788
00:33:16.151 --> 00:33:18.310
<v Speaker 1>because I definitely think that's part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

789
00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:23.020
<v Speaker 1>And he just is up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're exerting his alpha male is.</v>

790
00:33:23.021 --> 00:33:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of these guys simply aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha males.</v>

791
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.770
<v Speaker 1>So you can take a Marco Rubio who even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though I disagree with on most things,</v>

792
00:33:29.771 --> 00:33:30.604
<v Speaker 1>I think he's probably a decent human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and he's in the right line of </v>

793
00:33:33.131 --> 00:33:33.964
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually looked kind of human now </v>

794
00:33:35.621 --> 00:33:38.740
<v Speaker 1>that he's realized he's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's looking kind of human as opposed to</v>

795
00:33:38.741 --> 00:33:40.330
<v Speaker 1>the robot that we've been seeing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

796
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.370
<v Speaker 1>But you look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly not an Alpha male.</v>

797
00:33:42.371 --> 00:33:46.970
<v Speaker 1>You look at a Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just creepy car salesman,</v>

798
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them.</v>

799
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Ben Carson basically asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know like.</v>

800
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.433
<v Speaker 1>So is that really part of it that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are just looking for somebody to </v>

801
00:33:57.161 --> 00:34:01.900
<v Speaker 1>just get that feeling from us and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like now I'll follow you</v>

802
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.000
<v Speaker 2>and survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

803
00:34:04.001 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all unconscious.</v>

804
00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent of communication you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

805
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:09.314
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

806
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Anybody is ever dated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

807
00:34:11.181 --> 00:34:14.240
<v Speaker 2>if you're across from a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well man,</v>

808
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the case is,</v>

809
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.450
<v Speaker 2>you know the person's like this looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at their phone,</v>

810
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

811
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we go based on vibes.</v>

812
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:21.974
<v Speaker 2>But we as human beings want to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're logical and that we make </v>

813
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:26.684
<v Speaker 2>conclusions based on what we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We look at the evidence and we have all </v>

814
00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:31.220
<v Speaker 2>this information and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

815
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 2>We don't have all the information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media lies about things.</v>

816
00:34:34.311 --> 00:34:37.460
<v Speaker 2>The government lies about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea.</v>

817
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 2>The Federal Reserve has never been </v>
<v Speaker 2>audited.</v>

818
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.400
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's scary.</v>

819
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:47.240
<v Speaker 2>It's scary to think that I'm just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular schmuck who knows nothing.</v>

820
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.470
<v Speaker 2>It has no control.</v>

821
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.750
<v Speaker 2>But that's where the growth mindset </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in.</v>

822
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people are always like,</v>

823
00:34:52.851 --> 00:34:53.684
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably there should probably </v>

824
00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:55.040
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

825
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.960
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

826
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.120
<v Speaker 2>we have met in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty mellow in real life because I</v>

827
00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:02.000
<v Speaker 2>realized like I found a fucking control </v>
<v Speaker 2>over shit man.</v>

828
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I have control much more measured </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

829
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.930
<v Speaker 2>You on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what I was walking into.</v>

830
00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.620
<v Speaker 2>I have a little bit of control over how </v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel and what I think that's about it.</v>

831
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the world is sort of out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my control.</v>

832
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 2>So we talked about this pre show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your life is your life.</v>

833
00:35:18.831 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 2>People think Obama's going to save them </v>
<v Speaker 2>or ruined them.</v>

834
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.960
<v Speaker 2>People think that sanders is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>save them or unum.</v>

835
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.800
<v Speaker 2>People think that Hillary is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruin the life.</v>

836
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.900
<v Speaker 2>The same with trump.</v>

837
00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.213
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is trump going to ruin your life or </v>

838
00:35:29.901 --> 00:35:33.140
<v Speaker 2>make your life and that isn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>really a healthy way to go about it.</v>

839
00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:33.974
<v Speaker 2>So people feel ms dot saver though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back to the original point is that </v>

840
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got that vibe.</v>

841
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:41.640
<v Speaker 2>He's got that swagger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got watch them work and audience,</v>

842
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:42.474
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell people turn off and stand </v>

843
00:35:44.121 --> 00:35:45.380
<v Speaker 2>up half the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

844
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I said this and Obama is a Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And trump's,</v>

845
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.130
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say he said it.</v>

846
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.083
<v Speaker 2>Oh well I'll repeat what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well don't you dare say that I said </v>

847
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Obama's a Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

848
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Or with the Ted Cruz is a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

849
00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say it but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

850
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 2>you didn't hear what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well that guy said,</v>

851
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:02.280
<v Speaker 2>ted Cruz is a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But come on,</v>

852
00:36:02.281 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I would never say that I'm running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

853
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's good shit man.</v>

854
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.373
<v Speaker 2>So that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the interesting thing here </v>

855
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:09.564
<v Speaker 2>because I want people to say whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want and we all know it's bullshit </v>

856
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:13.140
<v Speaker 2>and they go to Congress and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

857
00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:13.974
<v Speaker 2>the gentlemen from blog and it's like we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know you all hate each other and you're </v>

858
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:19.530
<v Speaker 2>all making side deals and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unmasking that is all good and that's</v>

859
00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:22.380
<v Speaker 2>the part of the trump thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The train that I can get on.</v>

860
00:36:22.381 --> 00:36:25.680
<v Speaker 2>So maybe there will be some good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other part I can't get there.</v>

861
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:28.110
<v Speaker 2>The part about the policy stuff and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really believes,</v>

862
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.063
<v Speaker 2>and I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're basically saying that stuff </v>

863
00:36:30.511 --> 00:36:31.344
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Shit's going to go down either </v>

864
00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:35.070
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't get there on that,</v>

865
00:36:35.071 --> 00:36:35.904
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I accept your premise as to why other </v>

866
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 2>people can get their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump has politically.</v>

867
00:36:40.141 --> 00:36:45.141
<v Speaker 2>If I had to guess politically centrust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would put him to the right of Obama,</v>

868
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.230
<v Speaker 2>but to the left of everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

869
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.153
<v Speaker 2>which is why it all cracks me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody on the left is scared </v>

870
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 2>shitless to trump.</v>

871
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Trump is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a Rockefeller Liberal,</v>

872
00:36:56.821 --> 00:36:57.654
<v Speaker 2>New York liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does want to do something about </v>

873
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:00.040
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

874
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.830
<v Speaker 2>He's raised a discussion that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've traveled in the Middle East,</v>

875
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I've met Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more to it than America knows.</v>

876
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:08.934
<v Speaker 2>We don't know the full story on Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do know that isis is sending </v>

877
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:15.120
<v Speaker 2>people in as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as refugees.</v>

878
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.103
<v Speaker 2>I know that I went to Budapest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungary and I saw the refugees and they </v>

879
00:37:19.041 --> 00:37:19.874
<v Speaker 2>look like you and me and people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and way younger there's 70 percent </v>

880
00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:27.960
<v Speaker 2>men and if you take in 70 percent men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have enough women,</v>

881
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're mostly heterosexual.</v>

882
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.990
<v Speaker 2>You now have gender disbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are they going to get late?</v>

883
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.030
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to get violent?</v>

884
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 2>These are things that reasonable people </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be able to ask,</v>

885
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.720
<v Speaker 2>but if you even asked that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

886
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.400
<v Speaker 2>So you might as well just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

887
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let,</v>

888
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.760
<v Speaker 2>don't let any of them in there because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to say,</v>

889
00:37:47.761 --> 00:37:48.690
<v Speaker 2>you're done anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

890
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.860
<v Speaker 2>So if I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

891
00:37:49.861 --> 00:37:50.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in,</v>

892
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I went to Hungary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the train stations,</v>

893
00:37:52.381 --> 00:37:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I investigated it for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did reporting on it.</v>

894
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.180
<v Speaker 2>They're all men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all able bodied.</v>

895
00:37:57.181 --> 00:37:58.014
<v Speaker 2>They're all prime fighting age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they leaving the women back </v>

896
00:37:59.791 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 2>home?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is really going on?</v>

897
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:02.483
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say that your persona non grata </v>

898
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

899
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.993
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you look at the pictures coming </v>

900
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:11.730
<v Speaker 2>out where the migrants are crossing into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greece and they're crossing into Germany</v>

901
00:38:11.731 --> 00:38:14.070
<v Speaker 2>and wherever else they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all men.</v>

902
00:38:14.071 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 2>It's all men in their twenties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties,</v>

903
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:17.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent,</v>

904
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.443
<v Speaker 2>but a huge percentage of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where I as a liberal had </v>

905
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:21.564
<v Speaker 2>been painted into a corner here for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight months that I've been doing this </v>

906
00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:24.480
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

907
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.313
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to talk about the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between ideas and people and doctrine </v>

908
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:29.724
<v Speaker 2>versus the average person that may or </v>
<v Speaker 2>may not be religious and probably isn't </v>

909
00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:34.650
<v Speaker 2>a impressing anyone and doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow anything up.</v>

910
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.003
<v Speaker 2>But I've been left basically with my 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys on the left and the whole </v>

911
00:38:39.131 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>conversation has been handed to trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's just taking the meat,</v>

912
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just taking the red meat on this.</v>

913
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:45.523
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because here's what I learned to and </v>

914
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:47.494
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm kind of a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>while on twitter as I realized that if </v>

915
00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:52.600
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people ask me,</v>

916
00:38:52.601 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you really believe?</v>

917
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:54.341
<v Speaker 2>Author world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

918
00:38:54.341 --> 00:38:56.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that generally speaking,</v>

919
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.783
<v Speaker 2>women enjoy being more feminine and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>supportive role of a man who's more </v>

920
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:01.774
<v Speaker 2>dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to be a woman and you </v>

921
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:03.874
<v Speaker 2>want to be a lawyer or a CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody should stop you </v>

922
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 2>and I think you should be careful not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell women what they have to do.</v>

923
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Those pretty boring shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basic Shit.</v>

924
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.333
<v Speaker 2>But if you put that online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you contribute to a culture of </v>

925
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:19.940
<v Speaker 2>internalized misogyny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Turkey?</v>

926
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

927
00:39:20.341 --> 00:39:21.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't even say that,</v>

928
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 2>so you might as well say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

929
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sex is rough,</v>

930
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.013
<v Speaker 2>sex and women are crazy and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild sexual fantasies and everything </v>

931
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:29.783
<v Speaker 2>because they're gonna come after you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're doing the trump tactic </v>

932
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:34.090
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you're admitting it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically you're saying,</v>

933
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.073
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty moderate guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that women can do whatever they want </v>

934
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>

935
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:39.784
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're better off at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can do whatever they want to </v>

936
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're online,</v>

937
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:44.074
<v Speaker 2>you're staking out this stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to keep rattling the cage </v>

938
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.250
<v Speaker 2>and they're gonna come after you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

939
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:51.250
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing is feelings versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>

940
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.250
<v Speaker 2>People don't sit down and just have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational conversation.</v>

941
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you really think about this?</v>

942
00:39:55.511 --> 00:39:56.344
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have written about me before </v>

943
00:39:57.281 --> 00:39:57.911
<v Speaker 2>rentable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My tweets.</v>

944
00:39:57.911 --> 00:39:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

945
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I read this tweet where he told the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go kill himself.</v>

946
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.390
<v Speaker 2>What did you really mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

947
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.343
<v Speaker 2>the guy told him to kill himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had actually tried to kill his ex </v>

948
00:40:08.561 --> 00:40:12.250
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend had was at a rehab and burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cigarettes,</v>

949
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.020
<v Speaker 2>were real bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

950
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 2>And he was a troll who wasn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to kill himself.</v>

951
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:18.400
<v Speaker 2>He was doing the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a meltdown,</v>

952
00:40:18.401 --> 00:40:19.234
<v Speaker 2>therefore I'm mentally ill because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do when you do bad </v>

953
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:21.340
<v Speaker 2>things now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

954
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.140
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa Rehab your claim mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness,</v>

955
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.340
<v Speaker 2>but nobody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

956
00:40:24.341 --> 00:40:26.410
<v Speaker 2>what's the context man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the backstory?</v>

957
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.710
<v Speaker 2>So you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you might as well be a maniac.</v>

958
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.560
<v Speaker 2>You put on a good show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people love it.</v>

959
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 2>So when trump.</v>

960
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:34.953
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the funny thing and that's </v>

961
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:37.714
<v Speaker 2>probably why I saw early on why he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do so well as I watched one </v>

962
00:40:41.201 --> 00:40:43.770
<v Speaker 2>season of the apprentice when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>law school 10 years ago,</v>

963
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.673
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't really know anything about </v>

964
00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:47.460
<v Speaker 2>trump and I looked at what he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like him.</v>

965
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:52.480
<v Speaker 2>He's just doing what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on a scale that is way bigger than I</v>

966
00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:54.640
<v Speaker 2>do and what you're doing is you realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

967
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:56.230
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do people love?</v>

968
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:57.303
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

969
00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 2>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love drama.</v>

970
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.710
<v Speaker 2>People love conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conflict is attention.</v>

971
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Negative attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pause.</v>

972
00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Cause cause you can take a hater and </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn that into a lover,</v>

973
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.740
<v Speaker 2>but you can't turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't know about you on A.</v>

974
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to get maximum attention?</v>

975
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

976
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.083
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch any reality shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've maybe watched them five minutes of </v>

977
00:41:19.301 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 2>survivor ever.</v>

978
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.090
<v Speaker 2>I never watched American idol or any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

979
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 2>The only reality show that I've watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the celebrity apprentice.</v>

980
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 2>So this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

981
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 2>five years ago before he was running for</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

982
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess says it right there,</v>

983
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.793
<v Speaker 2>there is something about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to convince me to vote </v>

984
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.093
<v Speaker 2>for him by the end of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that I can understand the logic of </v>

985
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:40.390
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

986
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 2>and I thought also that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

987
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:42.374
<v Speaker 2>having someone on that's a trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporter would be interesting because </v>

988
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 2>everyone's just screaming at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

989
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.663
<v Speaker 2>So we should match the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media would love us to be sitting </v>

990
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:49.820
<v Speaker 2>here screaming at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would,</v>

991
00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.080
<v Speaker 2>that would help the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

992
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would help the narrative.</v>

993
00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:53.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

994
00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I would get a lot of interview requests </v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to.</v>

995
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:56.923
<v Speaker 2>They stopped calling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't email anymore because they </v>

996
00:41:58.161 --> 00:41:58.841
<v Speaker 2>talked to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

997
00:41:58.841 --> 00:41:59.690
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

998
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.470
<v Speaker 2>they want me to play pro wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>

999
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:02.303
<v Speaker 2>This is what the media wants and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I do a little bit online </v>

1000
00:42:04.941 --> 00:42:06.110
<v Speaker 2>because I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1001
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I grew up watching ads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro wrestling.</v>

1002
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm just to heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the bad guy.</v>

1003
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might as well be ric flair,</v>

1004
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.530
<v Speaker 2>the million dollar man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1005
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I might as well just because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make me one anywhere.</v>

1006
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.850
<v Speaker 2>As Mike Tyson said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could speak eloquently,</v>

1007
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to call me a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapist anyway,</v>

1008
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 2>so might as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1009
00:42:23.451 --> 00:42:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Just be crazy for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake,</v>

1010
00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:27.390
<v Speaker 2>the snake Roberts was my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

1011
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 2>He was a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't.</v>

1012
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Went Back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have many friends on his side.</v>

1013
00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.250
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like maybe that was the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy for me.</v>

1014
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1015
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 2>But think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1016
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Think about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1017
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.630
<v Speaker 2>How hard is immediate game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1018
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:42.890
<v Speaker 2>How hard is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1019
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I guess if you're trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that hard.</v>

1020
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:44.631
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1021
00:42:44.631 --> 00:42:45.170
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1022
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.130
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.870
<v Speaker 2>So you have all these people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you have a personal brand.</v>

1025

<v Speaker 2>but you'll see some guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an idiot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The media game is hard.</v>

1035
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.833
<v Speaker 2>Trump is winning it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe instead of saying list guys </v>

1036
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.830
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just take a step back,</v>

1037
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.840
<v Speaker 2>breathe and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what is he doing?</v>

1038
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.000
<v Speaker 2>And then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why is he doing it?</v>

1039
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.863
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed in the last few days since the </v>

1040
00:43:26.091 --> 00:43:29.720
<v Speaker 2>rally in Chicago that got canceled that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media definitely,</v>

1041
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:32.210
<v Speaker 2>I hate using the phrase of the media is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this monolith,</v>

1042
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 2>but the mainstream media and even a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the online stuff,</v>

1043
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 2>they've really doubled down now on trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>is evil and all that stuff.</v>

1044
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:40.783
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started this show by giving a litany </v>

1045
00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 2>of reasons why I'm not voting for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1046
00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.093
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that every time buzzfeed </v>

1047
00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 2>puts out an article saying why he's evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>or every time political does it or,</v>

1048
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:51.853
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially anything that's on the </v>

1049
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:53.300
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1050
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:54.134
<v Speaker 2>So New York magazine or then I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just strengthening him and they </v>

1051
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.770
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand is,</v>

1052
00:43:57.771 --> 00:43:58.604
<v Speaker 2>do you guys not understand psych 101?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did none of you go to college because </v>

1053
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.310
<v Speaker 2>all you're doing is making him stronger </v>
<v Speaker 2>case to everybody?</v>

1054
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Most of them don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of them do,</v>

1055
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.710
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately we're all in a big media </v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix.</v>

1056
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.633
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll uncover media hoax and then the </v>

1057
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.000
<v Speaker 2>next day I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1058
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this article and the whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I just said yesterday is a piece of</v>

1059
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:18.320
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1060
00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:19.154
<v Speaker 2>now I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's an interesting story on </v>

1061
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:21.854
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're all kind of caught in the </v>

1062
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:23.594
<v Speaker 2>Matrix and in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the savvy people know that they are </v>

1063
00:44:27.111 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 2>ultimately building his brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're getting clicks,</v>

1064
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting views.</v>

1065
00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.330
<v Speaker 1>We just all deserved the bullshit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

1066
00:44:34.331 --> 00:44:36.070
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything,</v>

1067
00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I know for a fact that if we did this </v>
<v Speaker 1>show a little bit differently,</v>

1068
00:44:39.581 --> 00:44:41.950
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the youtube game for example,</v>

1069
00:44:41.951 --> 00:44:44.050
<v Speaker 1>if we titled things a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>

1070
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.063
<v Speaker 1>we could double our clicks like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had many meetings with my guys and </v>

1071
00:44:47.591 --> 00:44:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

1072
00:44:48.671 --> 00:44:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to build something in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

1073
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:52.623
<v Speaker 1>but plenty of other people are so we all</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve the crap that we're getting </v>

1074
00:44:56.591 --> 00:44:57.610
<v Speaker 1>because we're building the crap.</v>

1075
00:44:58.090 --> 00:44:58.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to have a debate with the guy </v>

1076
00:45:00.911 --> 00:45:01.744
<v Speaker 2>once said we had a real civil talk just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're talking now and that the </v>

1077
00:45:04.091 --> 00:45:07.000
<v Speaker 2>youtube thing went on and he just was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

1078
00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.110
<v Speaker 2>are we going to scream at each other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what people want.</v>

1079
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:12.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>

1080
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.590
<v Speaker 2>That is what most everybody screams at </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

1081
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Everybody online and she's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1082
00:45:16.211 --> 00:45:17.800
<v Speaker 2>you're an Mri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil Mrs.</v>

1083
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Men's rights activists evil or you evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>as we are evil feminist or an evil that,</v>

1084
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.100
<v Speaker 2>that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what people want.</v>

1085
00:45:24.101 --> 00:45:25.330
<v Speaker 2>But then it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1086
00:45:25.331 --> 00:45:28.810
<v Speaker 2>you as an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to find your own integrity.</v>

1087
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And my integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think trump's integrity to us.</v>

1088
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I ultimately have a very good message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrap it up and drama,</v>

1089
00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:40.810
<v Speaker 2>conflict and all that other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but smart people see through it.</v>

1090
00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:42.270
<v Speaker 2>They can kind of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1091
00:45:42.271 --> 00:45:42.611
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1092
00:45:42.611 --> 00:45:43.840
<v Speaker 2>I kind of see what's going on.</v>

1093
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:44.541
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1094
00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:45.374
<v Speaker 2>To the theatrical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is somebody who cares a lot about </v>

1095
00:45:47.471 --> 00:45:50.710
<v Speaker 2>America and he does what nobody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>running does.</v>

1096
00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are Americans.</v>

1097
00:45:52.061 --> 00:45:54.220
<v Speaker 2>We have the right to have an identity as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nation.</v>

1098
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.233
<v Speaker 2>We have the right to have a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the right to say you as an </v>

1099
00:45:58.181 --> 00:45:59.014
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care more about you than I care about </v>

1100
00:46:00.671 --> 00:46:02.950
<v Speaker 2>people in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bangladesh,</v>

1101
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria,</v>

1102
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.810
<v Speaker 2>nobody else is saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where nationalism comes in.</v>

1103
00:46:07.811 --> 00:46:10.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's another reason that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing well is it's this idea that,</v>

1104
00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an American.</v>

1105
00:46:13.031 --> 00:46:14.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a lot of people,</v>

1106
00:46:14.741 --> 00:46:18.310
<v Speaker 2>even the sort of chattering class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called intellectuals would say,</v>

1107
00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:19.323
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalism is bad and you're part of a </v>

1108
00:46:20.351 --> 00:46:21.184
<v Speaker 2>global society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you're part of a global </v>

1109
00:46:23.051 --> 00:46:23.884
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but go travel somewhere and you'll find </v>

1110
00:46:25.241 --> 00:46:28.240
<v Speaker 2>right away that they don't think you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of a global society.</v>

1111
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 1>So is that why his slogan even make </v>
<v Speaker 1>America great again?</v>

1112
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.140
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants things to be great,</v>

1113
00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:34.974
<v Speaker 1>so that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also throwing the word again in </v>

1114
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:38.730
<v Speaker 1>their implies that we lost something </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

1115
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.460
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get that thing back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus Bernie's,</v>

1116
00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:42.294
<v Speaker 1>which is a future to believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Bernie's not talking about getting a </v>

1117
00:46:46.051 --> 00:46:47.610
<v Speaker 1>feeling back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>

1118
00:46:47.611 --> 00:46:48.444
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something out there is pretty good at </v>

1119
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 1>trump's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lost some shit.</v>

1120
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:52.914
<v Speaker 1>So it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just about which part of the brain </v>

1121
00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:55.374
<v Speaker 1>these guys are</v>

1122
00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.350
<v Speaker 2>todd onto?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump packs more information in a slogan</v>

1123
00:46:59.351 --> 00:47:02.920
<v Speaker 2>or a tweet than anybody else does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He jams in Atlanta is worse.</v>

1124
00:47:02.921 --> 00:47:04.630
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make America great again.</v>

1125
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:07.630
<v Speaker 2>If you're an advertising or marketing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's aspirational,</v>

1126
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.853
<v Speaker 2>you know that if you're in marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want an app to be an aspirational </v>

1127
00:47:12.041 --> 00:47:14.080
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is an aspirational.</v>

1128
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:14.914
<v Speaker 2>This is all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what pisses me off fucking </v>

1129
00:47:16.091 --> 00:47:16.924
<v Speaker 2>marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can all these people who claim they </v>

1130
00:47:18.551 --> 00:47:20.920
<v Speaker 2>know marketing not just sit and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1131
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:24.550
<v Speaker 2>trump is running an ad campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is an aspirational good.</v>

1132
00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Trump is saying make America great </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1133
00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:27.723
<v Speaker 2>That's an aspirational slogan and tying </v>
<v Speaker 2>on nationalistic feelings like America </v>

1134
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 2>and make is a very sort of can do word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans have a can do attitude.</v>

1135
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy who wrote a book about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1136
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing what's in his book,</v>

1137
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this stuff used to sort of,</v>

1138
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:41.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I have to use the girl </v>

1139
00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:43.840
<v Speaker 2>mindset was like maddening.</v>

1140
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you,</v>

1141
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 2>you aren't intelligent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just analyze this.</v>

1142
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:49.204
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because that's my own weakness </v>

1143
00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:53.440
<v Speaker 2>and thinking that people are logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're logical,</v>

1144
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 2>you would just sit down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1145
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 2>here's what trump does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You read his tweets.</v>

1146
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Many people have said that I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest man in the world.</v>

1147
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.700
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What has he done there?</v>

1148
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social proof.</v>

1149
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we are a monkey's wealth,</v>

1150
00:48:04.271 --> 00:48:05.104
<v Speaker 2>many people think it must be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not bragging because he's not </v>

1151
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:10.420
<v Speaker 2>saying that that's what many people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1152
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.170
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of times you could just sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and look at trump's tweets,</v>

1153
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:15.243
<v Speaker 2>read them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really see that this guy uses </v>

1154
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:18.100
<v Speaker 2>language wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they go,</v>

1155
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:19.300
<v Speaker 2>is an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a buffoon.</v>

1156
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.201
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1157
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:20.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1158
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.910
<v Speaker 2>you're the fucking buffoon because I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain it just very logically.</v>

1159
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Every he uses social proof.</v>

1160
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.560
<v Speaker 2>He uses cognitive biases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1161
00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 2>in college you learn the logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallacies to make good arguments.</v>

1162
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:32.763
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you're a soft fist and you take </v>

1163
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:37.950
<v Speaker 2>the logical fallacies to trick people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a Sophos,</v>

1164
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're not dumb.</v>

1165
00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're the smart guy because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that you learn to analyze logical</v>

1166
00:48:44.351 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 2>fallacies is because we are lazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkers and fallacies.</v>

1167
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Work is just a good way of manipulating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.300
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>

1169
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you use a logical fallacy,</v>

1170
00:48:54.261 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 2>you're stupid maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're using a logical fallacy,</v>

1171
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:59.260
<v Speaker 2>you get people to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fall San Francisco.</v>

1172
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Marco Rubio's send a foam party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1173
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.870
<v Speaker 2>I haven't said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't said anything,</v>

1174
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.420
<v Speaker 2>but Marco Rubio said that he was in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>foam party.</v>

1175
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now using the fallacy of getting you</v>

1176
00:49:09.851 --> 00:49:13.000
<v Speaker 2>to draw false inference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must've been some gay thing.</v>

1177
00:49:13.001 --> 00:49:15.010
<v Speaker 2>And is he really in the closet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1178
00:49:15.011 --> 00:49:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said it.</v>

1179
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1180
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:19.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1181
00:49:19.111 --> 00:49:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fully get what you're saying.</v>

1182
00:49:20.851 --> 00:49:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It's such a dangerous slippery slope and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are going to play the game.</v>

1183
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.093
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are angry at him because he's </v>

1184
00:49:27.241 --> 00:49:28.074
<v Speaker 1>playing the game at a higher level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tweeted a day or two ago and it's </v>

1185
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.040
<v Speaker 1>taking off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1186
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.430
<v Speaker 1>The second thing about it was three </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and it was one,</v>

1187
00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:36.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't support trump.</v>

1188
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I do believe in free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you use your free speech to take away</v>

1189
00:49:42.031 --> 00:49:44.670
<v Speaker 1>someone else's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then one day they will come for you.</v>

1190
00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:45.683
<v Speaker 1>And I think that really sums up what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on here because if you look at </v>

1191
00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:49.350
<v Speaker 1>what happened at the rally the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

1192
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:53.040
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the government that came in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't a first amendment issue.</v>

1193
00:49:53.041 --> 00:49:55.530
<v Speaker 1>The government didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to say this,</v>

1194
00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.633
<v Speaker 1>but if we start getting to a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying this is exactly what </v>

1195
00:49:59.701 --> 00:50:00.534
<v Speaker 1>happened that night because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little unclear who started what and </v>

1196
00:50:01.951 --> 00:50:02.784
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we get to a place where everyone </v>

1197
00:50:04.321 --> 00:50:08.370
<v Speaker 1>is just using their free speech to shout</v>
<v Speaker 1>down everybody else,</v>

1198
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.593
<v Speaker 1>well then we don't have free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with the </v>

1199
00:50:11.281 --> 00:50:11.970
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

1200
00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:12.803
<v Speaker 1>So there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge free speech play here </v>

1201
00:50:13.771 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1202
00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they call it the heckler's veto.</v>

1203
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:18.940
<v Speaker 2>You're going to let one guy scream </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else down.</v>

1204
00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:19.923
<v Speaker 2>So then whoever has the biggest heckler </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the person who controls the debate </v>

1205
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.153
<v Speaker 2>and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the broader point you make is perfect </v>

1206
00:50:25.721 --> 00:50:26.554
<v Speaker 2>because not to plug my documentary that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing and that we want to talk to </v>

1207
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:29.860
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll go away.</v>

1208
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.693
<v Speaker 2>That's pissed off a lot of my guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's called silenced our war on </v>

1209
00:50:34.561 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 2>free speech and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1210
00:50:36.321 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our war is a war and we want to think,</v>

1211
00:50:38.991 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a war on all of us.</v>

1212
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:41.294
<v Speaker 2>Free thinkers and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't the government censoring </v>

1213
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're fucking doing it to each other.</v>

1214
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid if I say the wrong thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1215
00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.740
<v Speaker 2>you're going to think I'm a shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1216
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.200
<v Speaker 2>You're afraid that if you post the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing on twitter,</v>

1217
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get fired from your job </v>
<v Speaker 2>or people are gonna come after you.</v>

1218
00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.120
<v Speaker 2>They're going to call your advertised as</v>
<v Speaker 2>one long thing.</v>

1219
00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 2>So we're all kind of censoring each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other were really,</v>

1220
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.010
<v Speaker 2>why don't we just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1221
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said that.</v>

1222
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:02.930
<v Speaker 2>What do you really mean it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1223
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 2>you're a trump supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will why your trump supporter?</v>

1224
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a maybe.</v>

1225
00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if somebody would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1226
00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:08.864
<v Speaker 2>I'm a trump supporter because I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>America has the right to exist as a </v>

1227
00:51:11.661 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 2>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1228
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:13.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1229
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:14.380
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it.</v>

1230
00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Did it right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just talk.</v>

1231
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.633
<v Speaker 2>That's what people should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You listen to one another and right now </v>

1232
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:21.510
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all declaring war on each other.</v>

1233
00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting.</v>

1234
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.323
<v Speaker 1>But it goes to the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the higher road here or almost </v>

1235
00:51:28.281 --> 00:51:30.020
<v Speaker 1>destined to lose then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1236
00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're taking the higher road</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and you're saying,</v>

1237
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to respect your free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like what you say,</v>

1238
00:51:35.181 --> 00:51:37.340
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to defend your right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>

1239
00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:38.763
<v Speaker 1>If you take that road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well basically from everything you've </v>

1240
00:51:41.151 --> 00:51:41.984
<v Speaker 1>said here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a huge swell of </v>

1241
00:51:43.041 --> 00:51:48.041
<v Speaker 1>people that won't do that and thus will </v>
<v Speaker 1>always win with the heckler's veto.</v>

1242
00:51:48.651 --> 00:51:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's where I see this all going.</v>

1243
00:51:50.391 --> 00:51:51.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've been talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

1244
00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:54.300
<v Speaker 2>were winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now there's a massive counterculture</v>

1245
00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.340
<v Speaker 2>where people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1246
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.010
<v Speaker 2>me and Lauren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the director of the silence,</v>

1247
00:51:59.011 --> 00:52:00.210
<v Speaker 2>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make free speech.</v>

1248
00:52:00.211 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1249
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have an agenda.</v>

1250
00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.440
<v Speaker 2>We just want people to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1251
00:52:04.441 --> 00:52:05.274
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to share your point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool to talk and more people are </v>

1252
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:08.874
<v Speaker 2>getting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at whose profiles are being </v>

1253
00:52:10.531 --> 00:52:12.360
<v Speaker 2>raised on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of,</v>

1254
00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:13.643
<v Speaker 2>twitter is where the future's headed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I love twitter and we could </v>

1255
00:52:16.141 --> 00:52:17.780
<v Speaker 2>do a whole hour and just why I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

1256
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Twitter is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The future is.</v>

1257
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:20.483
<v Speaker 2>Even though the business is crumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean the ideas behind because the </v>

1258
00:52:22.681 --> 00:52:25.860
<v Speaker 2>people who are kind of out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the word thought leaders,</v>

1259
00:52:25.861 --> 00:52:28.530
<v Speaker 2>but hip smart tech savvy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what they're thinking.</v>

1260
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:30.090
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like people like you.</v>

1261
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:33.120
<v Speaker 2>They like people like Laura southern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like people like Milo,</v>

1262
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:34.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like people like Gavin [inaudible] </v>

1263
00:52:34.641 --> 00:52:35.820
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my profile is going.</v>

1264
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:38.280
<v Speaker 2>So the people who are sort of pro free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

1265
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.263
<v Speaker 2>their profiles are growing and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a pushback against the </v>

1266
00:52:41.431 --> 00:52:42.264
<v Speaker 2>regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what had happened is we had given </v>

1267
00:52:44.311 --> 00:52:45.144
<v Speaker 2>everybody the heckler's veto to call you</v>
<v Speaker 2>a homophobe or a racist and </v>

1268
00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:49.900
<v Speaker 2>misogynistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transphobic.</v>

1269
00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.500
<v Speaker 2>We say one wrong thing and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing,</v>

1270
00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's shutting everybody speech down.</v>

1271
00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Now before we have the regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sjws we had the moral majority.</v>

1272
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.570
<v Speaker 2>We had tipper Gore trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't listen to it because you and I</v>

1273
00:53:03.571 --> 00:53:03.991
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1274
00:53:03.991 --> 00:53:07.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say we're old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handsome men are fucking old man.</v>

1275
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Like ice tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>body cow,</v>

1276
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.550
<v Speaker 2>cop killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1277
00:53:11.551 --> 00:53:12.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's inciting violence.</v>

1278
00:53:12.661 --> 00:53:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do in bed.</v>

1279
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I never asked anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1280
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:16.733
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid committed suicide after </v>

1281
00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:21.330
<v Speaker 2>listening to Judas priest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is satanic music without a bandit.</v>

1282
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you fall off the right,</v>

1283
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:24.893
<v Speaker 2>the left did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the left came in and now </v>

1284
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:29.400
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now instead of saying,</v>

1285
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:30.234
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games make you find this a little </v>

1286
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:31.853
<v Speaker 2>bit against Mickey hate women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we have a new counterculture </v>

1287
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 2>that's going to push that back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then guess what?</v>

1288
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Specificity Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1289
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 2>guys like you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our whole fucking life,</v>

1290
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be in 10 years,</v>

1291
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:43.374
<v Speaker 2>will be finding the right again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in another 10 years we'll find </v>

1292
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:45.790
<v Speaker 2>the left again.</v>

1293
00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that center and that bill,</v>

1294
00:53:48.671 --> 00:53:49.504
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that the people that </v>

1295
00:53:49.991 --> 00:53:50.824
<v Speaker 1>you just mentioned there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Laura and Lauren and I'm Milo </v>

1296
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.420
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their role to the right.</v>

1297
00:53:55.421 --> 00:53:56.260
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1298
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1299
00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm the last man standing over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1300
00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.900
<v Speaker 1>but yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is growing.</v>

1301
00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.000
<v Speaker 1>So how do we then coalesce around that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that we're,</v>

1302
00:54:05.001 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1303
00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure who I'm going to vote for </v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>

1304
00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we can sit here and do this.</v>

1305
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:11.463
<v Speaker 1>How do we coalesce around that idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need conversation more than we need </v>

1306
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.160
<v Speaker 1>everyone judging everybody into </v>
<v Speaker 1>oblivion?</v>

1307
00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:18.591
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1308
00:54:18.591 --> 00:54:19.424
<v Speaker 2>I have a little bit of an idealist and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly believe if we're talking to each </v>

1309
00:54:22.671 --> 00:54:24.170
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not killing each other.</v>

1310
00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:25.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1311
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.360
<v Speaker 2>What a lot of people don't realize if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't studied a lot of history,</v>

1312
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:30.380
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1313
00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.540
<v Speaker 2>we think we can have a Cambodian </v>
<v Speaker 2>holocaust.</v>

1314
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.880
<v Speaker 2>We think that we can't have an Armenian </v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide.</v>

1315
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:38.360
<v Speaker 2>We think we can't have Milo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milo is greatly forward or what they had</v>

1316
00:54:38.361 --> 00:54:40.280
<v Speaker 2>in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we?</v>

1317
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Why are we so special?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1318
00:54:41.931 --> 00:54:43.640
<v Speaker 2>that all started with censorship </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

1319
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:47.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't say certain things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>started with us versus them.</v>

1320
00:54:47.001 --> 00:54:49.220
<v Speaker 2>For the Cambodian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cambodian genocide,</v>

1321
00:54:49.221 --> 00:54:51.350
<v Speaker 2>you had the farmers with real people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city.</v>

1322
00:54:51.351 --> 00:54:55.850
<v Speaker 2>People were the bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was identity politics even within a</v>

1323
00:54:55.851 --> 00:54:58.040
<v Speaker 2>single race of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens?</v>

1324
00:54:58.070 --> 00:54:58.903
<v Speaker 2>You don't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to the underground and then the </v>

1325
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:01.043
<v Speaker 2>fucking lunatics talked only other Luna </v>
<v Speaker 2>lunatics because there's still going to </v>

1326
00:55:04.191 --> 00:55:06.440
<v Speaker 2>talk and then you have all the lunatics </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

1327
00:55:06.441 --> 00:55:07.274
<v Speaker 2>on the ground talking to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get people blowing shit </v>

1328
00:55:10.131 --> 00:55:10.964
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get people killing each </v>

1329
00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:11.570
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1330
00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in an instance where I saw two videos</v>

1331
00:55:14.601 --> 00:55:15.434
<v Speaker 1>this week were one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trump supporter was at a rally </v>

1332
00:55:16.851 --> 00:55:17.684
<v Speaker 1>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to Auschwitz and then another </v>

1333
00:55:19.311 --> 00:55:20.450
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was screaming at a,</v>

1334
00:55:20.451 --> 00:55:23.720
<v Speaker 1>at a black person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a go back to Africa.</v>

1335
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:25.363
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually something good there </v>

1336
00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:31.250
<v Speaker 1>because it's being unearthed as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to these people just festering.</v>

1337
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.500
<v Speaker 2>They're screaming at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's hitting each other.</v>

1338
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are hitting each other so well.</v>

1339
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.233
<v Speaker 2>The protest is there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no more than a music festival </v>

1340
00:55:40.131 --> 00:55:42.230
<v Speaker 2>though the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always use this people,</v>

1341
00:55:42.231 --> 00:55:43.064
<v Speaker 2>you need to get out more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to a rock music festival other than </v>

1342
00:55:45.411 --> 00:55:47.090
<v Speaker 2>May pry burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody fights,</v>

1343
00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:47.953
<v Speaker 2>but other may you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go to a rock concert or rap </v>

1344
00:55:50.031 --> 00:55:52.070
<v Speaker 2>concert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have people.</v>

1345
00:55:52.071 --> 00:55:52.904
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna have people kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting each other and that's again </v>

1346
00:55:54.441 --> 00:55:58.340
<v Speaker 2>media manipulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logic verse is cognitive bias.</v>

1347
00:55:58.341 --> 00:55:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logically speaking,</v>

1348
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:04.990
<v Speaker 2>if you have multiple rallies with 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people there and you have 10 of them and</v>

1349
00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:09.450
<v Speaker 2>there's one fight that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that one in $100,000,</v>

1350
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.690
<v Speaker 2>that would be the safest city in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1351
00:56:11.691 --> 00:56:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you focus on that one fight and that</v>

1352
00:56:14.181 --> 00:56:16.040
<v Speaker 2>becomes the narrative where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

1353
00:56:16.041 --> 00:56:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Well it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one 78 year old guy punched a guy</v>

1354
00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.460
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the faces sucker punched.</v>

1355
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:23.363
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there had been all these rallies </v>

1356
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 2>and there's a couple instances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logically speaking,</v>

1357
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 2>statistically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't really a big deal.</v>

1358
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.673
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1359
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:31.543
<v Speaker 2>just to push back on that a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean trump is also offering to pay </v>

1360
00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:36.820
<v Speaker 2>that guy his legal fees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems pretty crazy to me.</v>

1361
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:37.654
<v Speaker 2>A guy punched a 70 year old and punched </v>
<v Speaker 2>a black guy walking out regardless of </v>

1362
00:56:41.371 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of his race.</v>

1363
00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but punch the guy and trump saying,</v>

1364
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll pay for your legal fees is a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you give me that one?</v>

1365
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.650
<v Speaker 2>He offered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a different time that you've,</v>

1366
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.380
<v Speaker 2>you've conflated different stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a different riot were.</v>

1367
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:54.663
<v Speaker 2>So I guess there's a couple of rides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people there are people </v>

1368
00:56:56.711 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 2>swinging punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1369
00:56:58.030 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 2>did you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1370
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.020
<v Speaker 2>did you see what happened when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1371
00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:03.083
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give a guy free </v>

1372
00:57:03.401 --> 00:57:04.234
<v Speaker 2>publicity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a conservative breitbart </v>

1373
00:57:05.291 --> 00:57:08.470
<v Speaker 2>speaker who gave a talk at cal state Los</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles.</v>

1374
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:09.813
<v Speaker 2>I have videos of a breitbart intern </v>
<v Speaker 2>being thrown to the ground by a black </v>

1375
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:16.090
<v Speaker 2>lives matter protester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the video.</v>

1376
00:57:16.091 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Lauren Feldman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the director for silence.</v>

1377
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 2>We have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That didn't make news right?</v>

1378
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.083
<v Speaker 2>That suddenly violence goes both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know everybody likes what the media </v>

1379
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:25.744
<v Speaker 2>likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have no doubt the violence goes </v>

1380
00:57:26.471 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 2>both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

1381
00:57:27.731 --> 00:57:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the interesting thing too,</v>

1382
00:57:30.491 --> 00:57:31.324
<v Speaker 2>about logic versus not logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we objectively count how much </v>

1383
00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.940
<v Speaker 2>drama is going on at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Sandra's event,</v>

1384
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1385
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 2>he had a Bernie Sanders supporter jump </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a guard rail to try to go to attack</v>

1386
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:43.690
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1387
00:57:43.691 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I read the guy's tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy is a total nut job.</v>

1388
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

1389
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:49.870
<v Speaker 2>He goes on CNN and they treat him like </v>
<v Speaker 2>he is stood up to a bully.</v>

1390
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1391
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 2>why is he standing up to bullies trump?</v>

1392
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1393
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:55.420
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like trump.</v>

1394
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Trump's talking now you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump over a guard rail to attack a guy,</v>

1395
00:57:59.411 --> 00:58:03.790
<v Speaker 2>and he'd posted on twitter before high </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to kill trump and why is that?</v>

1396
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:04.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of a nice way to wrap this </v>

1397
00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:06.754
<v Speaker 2>thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although clearly we could have gone a </v>

1398
00:58:07.241 --> 00:58:08.074
<v Speaker 2>lot longer than this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it shows what a moral mess </v>

1399
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:11.440
<v Speaker 2>everybody's in because I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do agree with that.</v>

1400
00:58:11.441 --> 00:58:12.274
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thrilled with the things trump </v>

1401
00:58:12.881 --> 00:58:13.451
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1402
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not supporting the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when that guy rushed the stage,</v>

1403
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the history of this guy's</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweets,</v>

1404
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:19.714
<v Speaker 2>he's a bit of a nut bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said some crazy things and then CNN </v>

1405
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 2>treated him like a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1406
00:58:23.711 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a trump supporter had bum rushed,</v>

1407
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:27.574
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone not only would say this guy </v>

1408
00:58:29.381 --> 00:58:30.214
<v Speaker 2>should be in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they wouldn't have given him an </v>

1409
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:33.760
<v Speaker 2>interview on CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'd also be blaming trump.</v>

1410
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:34.431
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1411
00:58:34.431 --> 00:58:36.670
<v Speaker 2>there is an unevenness here that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to wrap up,</v>

1412
00:58:36.671 --> 00:58:39.070
<v Speaker 2>but I think we did a little evening of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the playing field here.</v>

1413
00:58:39.071 --> 00:58:39.750
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1414
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:40.990
<v Speaker 2>We're not logical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1415
00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.190
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're creatures.</v>

1416
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 2>We want stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want simple stories of the world.</v>

1417
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:45.363
<v Speaker 2>Trump understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's playing the game better than </v>

1418
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:49.060
<v Speaker 2>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they don't like them,</v>

1419
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:51.010
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as we're talking,</v>

1420
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 2>you're a human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a human.</v>

1421
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:54.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to kill gay people,</v>

1422
00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know a gay guy,</v>

1423
00:58:56.051 --> 00:58:57.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to kill straight white guys</v>

1424
00:58:57.731 --> 00:59:00.130
<v Speaker 2>even though I had the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

1425
00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you,</v>

1426
00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:03.220
<v Speaker 2>as you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to each other,</v>

1427
00:59:03.221 --> 00:59:03.651
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1428
00:59:03.651 --> 00:59:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying gay people or this or this</v>

1429
00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:08.080
<v Speaker 2>or that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know a guy and he's not like that.</v>

1430
00:59:08.081 --> 00:59:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not really large.</v>

1431
00:59:09.071 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>

1432
00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:12.910
<v Speaker 2>all gay people or this or that is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical,</v>

1433
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:14.770
<v Speaker 2>but that's the way we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1434
00:59:14.771 --> 00:59:15.604
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reaching out to people who </v>

1435
00:59:16.751 --> 00:59:17.584
<v Speaker 2>disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your own illogical brain helps you </v>

1436
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:21.680
<v Speaker 2>become a better person.</v>

1437
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.960
<v Speaker 1>That's how you end an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1438
00:59:23.961 --> 00:59:26.540
<v Speaker 1>so I want to thank Mike Cernovich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can check out his book,</v>

1439
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:27.374
<v Speaker 1>Gorilla Mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to control your thoughts and </v>

1440
00:59:29.181 --> 00:59:31.790
<v Speaker 1>emotions to live life on your terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:59:31.791 --> 00:59:34.280
<v Speaker 1>and direct.</v>
