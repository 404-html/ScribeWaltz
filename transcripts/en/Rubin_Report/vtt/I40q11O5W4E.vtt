<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Hi Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good to be here.</v>

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you are here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we were talking before we started,</v>

6
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>you were saying that I'm going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get some hate for this.</v>

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Are you warning me of pre hate?</v>

8
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.743
<v Speaker 2>I think you've probably already got some</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate just for announcing that I'm going </v>

9
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:25.824
<v Speaker 2>to be on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of people who have </v>

10
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 2>some kind of pull her over for wars and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones I think is,</v>

11
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy central,</v>

12
00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 2>but most people don't realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

13
00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:37.414
<v Speaker 2>Alex is not this big main controlling </v>
<v Speaker 2>force like dictating what everybody </v>

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.833
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pretty much gives me free reign to </v>

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 2>talk about whatever I want and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's good about info wars.</v>

16
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a very broad church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got,</v>

17
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>numerous reits as commentators who </v>

18
00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:52.864
<v Speaker 2>worked with him for wars and they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically talk about and write about </v>

19
00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as far as I'm concerned,</v>

20
00:00:58.961 --> 00:00:59.794
<v Speaker 2>that's the best job imaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think people need to get over it </v>

21
00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:04.774
<v Speaker 2>and move on because the sun is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about supersede any </v>

22
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 2>perception about what info wars is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

23
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 2>what people think it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

24
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:14.914
<v Speaker 2>I just want people to listen to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to say and concentrate on the </v>

25
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 2>sun rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

26
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 2>what website is hosted on that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant at the end of the day.</v>

27
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened.</v>

28
00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:24.814
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just sent one tweet out this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning saying that you were coming on </v>

29
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>the show and immediate conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorist,</v>

30
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:30.184
<v Speaker 1>he works with Alex Jones and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are having conspiracy theories </v>

31
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>about the conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

32
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:36.364
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just talk it out and we'll see </v>

33
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:38.134
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

34
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as bad as it used to be.</v>

35
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know there's this perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there that,</v>

36
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Info wars is discredited or whatever,</v>

37
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 2>but I mean when breaking stuff every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

38
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Well linked on the drudge report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 2>we've got 20 million listeners a week </v>
<v Speaker 2>now for the radio show.</v>

40
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 2>So whether you like cars or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever a presence and you know,</v>

41
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>that's why some people have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>

42
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:00.824
<v Speaker 2>but as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just concentrate on the issues of what </v>

43
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:03.584
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying and in fact my youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel explores these kinds of issues </v>

44
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 2>off on a tangent from the normal content</v>
<v Speaker 2>that info was,</v>

45
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:11.744
<v Speaker 2>would cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've kind of attracted a new </v>

46
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 2>satellite audience outside of Info wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's all about bringing new people in</v>

47
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:19.784
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I've attempted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I think I've been </v>

48
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 2>successful recently.</v>

49
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's your youtube channel that </v>

50
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:25.584
<v Speaker 1>actually got me familiar with what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing because you did a phenomenal </v>

51
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>video on the regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which everyone knows.</v>

52
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:32.154
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've done some really interesting </v>

53
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>stuff about the European immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

54
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.043
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get into all the issues </v>

55
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

56
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>but just to wrap up the info wars part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

57
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>how did you get involved with Info wars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your relationship like with Alex?</v>

58
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's go down that route for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

59
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I started my own political </v>

60
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 2>website when I was about 18 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

61
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I would go home and host a radio show on</v>
<v Speaker 2>dial up internet to three people,</v>

62
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 2>two listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.474
<v Speaker 2>back in the early two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the very genesis of Alex </v>

64
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 2>liked what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He liked the content I was covering,</v>

65
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.470
<v Speaker 2>so he basically headhunted me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

66
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>coming in and edit info was coming right</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us.</v>

67
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened.</v>

68
00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm based in London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're based in Austin,</v>

69
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a,</v>

70
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six hours ahead of time so I can get a </v>

71
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 2>jump on the news that's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial with a news organization.</v>

72
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it kind of works and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>lets me write and say what I want.</v>

73
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>He's not this controlling presence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.303
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people think that Alex Jones is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of act that it's put on this </v>

75
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.534
<v Speaker 2>radio personality that he has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you meet him and you hang around </v>

76
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you see is what you get.</v>

77
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>That's how I like joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like that all the time.</v>

78
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not an act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not putting it on,</v>

79
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

80
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 2>in private,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

81
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:52.834
<v Speaker 2>in person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of more jovial and fun than </v>

82
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 2>his rants on the radio would suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's him.</v>

83
00:03:58.061 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 2>That's his personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an act.</v>

84
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>

85
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:01.984
<v Speaker 1>were you trepidatious to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to join forces with him because </v>

86
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>obviously it was a good opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's saying that it's worked for you.</v>

87
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.523
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of what I said before about </v>

88
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I just send one tweet out and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>start yelling at me.</v>

89
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>You must have had some level of concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

90
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.300
<v Speaker 2>Well that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a long time ago,</v>

91
00:04:17.301 --> 00:04:20.270
<v Speaker 2>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really Alex was only a few years into</v>

92
00:04:20.271 --> 00:04:21.104
<v Speaker 2>his operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I built up a good deal of traffic with </v>

93
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:26.840
<v Speaker 2>my own website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was no trepidation.</v>

94
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:29.000
<v Speaker 2>It was just about reaching a wider </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

95
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:32.150
<v Speaker 2>So obviously I jumped at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

96
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where do you actually consider </v>

97
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:35.614
<v Speaker 1>yourself politically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have a good sense and one of </v>

98
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>the things we've been talking about here</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sort of this new growing center.</v>

99
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>People who really want to stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech and civil liberties,</v>

100
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.294
<v Speaker 1>but also understand that we have real </v>
<v Speaker 1>threats and that this immigration issue </v>

101
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:50.434
<v Speaker 1>in Europe is a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to be able to honestly talk </v>

102
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>about Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

103
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>So the old dynamic of right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left Democrat,</v>

104
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 1>conservative for us in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all seems to be crumbling.</v>

105
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>So I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you even consider yourself if,</v>

106
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>if you had to go with a label?</v>

107
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

108
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.004
<v Speaker 2>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously when I was a teenager I was a </v>

109
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>progressive and I think it was Winston </v>
<v Speaker 2>Churchill that said,</v>

110
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 2>if you're not a liberal when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>

111
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 2>you have no heart if you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative when you get older,</v>

112
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.773
<v Speaker 2>you have no brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a moment in my thirties I would </v>

113
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:20.764
<v Speaker 2>consider myself mainly a limited area </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you could call me a </v>

114
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:24.544
<v Speaker 2>conservative area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's somewhere within that gap </v>

115
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:27.574
<v Speaker 2>between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's basically where I'm at right </v>

116
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

117
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you find that movement growing,</v>

118
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are?</v>

119
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Because I do sense it's growing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

120
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:39.170
<v Speaker 1>our politics have gotten so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.103
<v Speaker 1>between a democratic socialist who's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot guy on the left and trump who is </v>

122
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of off the rails but confused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 1>is he really a Republican?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he stand for conservative values or</v>

124
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:52.800
<v Speaker 1>is he truly a centrist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of it makes sense anymore.</v>

125
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Are you guys getting some of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling too?</v>

126
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 2>So some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some extent.</v>

127
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.424
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean in the UK it's still </v>

128
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 2>extremely left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even,</v>

129
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>even the Tory party isn't classically </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

130
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.374
<v Speaker 2>They're somewhat left on a lot of Su,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so most people don't even know what a </v>

131
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>libertarian is in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

132
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:13.034
<v Speaker 2>the only people who are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically active will know what that </v>

133
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:15.914
<v Speaker 2>actually means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think America is streets ahead in </v>

134
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 2>the sense of actually understanding that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a political alternative outside</v>

135
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 2>of progressivism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is still what dominates the entire</v>

136
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 2>discourse in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people will think you're a racist</v>

137
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 2>or a bigger if you're not a progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially as a young person.</v>

138
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.103
<v Speaker 2>So the circles in which I move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's very little understanding about </v>

139
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 2>what these labels mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I try to concentrate on the</v>

140
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 2>issues without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>coming at it from a left or right </v>
<v Speaker 2>persuasion.</v>

142
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very much what I've tried to </v>

143
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:51.450
<v Speaker 1>do and I've tried to define a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these terms and you know,</v>

144
00:06:51.451 --> 00:06:54.510
<v Speaker 1>the whole Libertarian ideology really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fits with me,</v>

145
00:06:54.511 --> 00:06:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do with your body what you want,</v>

146
00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:00.790
<v Speaker 1>let the government stay out of your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part and,</v>

147
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:01.624
<v Speaker 1>and build a life that works for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're saying that that the idea of </v>

148
00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Speaker 1>that is really gone in the UK now.</v>

149
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was ever here really.</v>

150
00:07:11.761 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people came to grips with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

151
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's still,</v>

152
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.960
<v Speaker 2>there's still some debate within </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian circles about certain issues</v>

153
00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:19.794
<v Speaker 2>like abortion or like open borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean some Libertarians think that to </v>

154
00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:27.150
<v Speaker 2>be truly classically libertarian you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to advocate open borders.</v>

155
00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Other people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

156
00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:29.454
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the government foisting open </v>

157
00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:33.210
<v Speaker 2>borders upon the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:36.840
<v Speaker 2>taking their tax money to pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean within the UK,</v>

159
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.510
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my experience,</v>

160
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:42.360
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these labels aren't even known,</v>

161
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.223
<v Speaker 2>they're not even defined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you describe yourself as a </v>

162
00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:49.410
<v Speaker 2>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have no frame of reference,</v>

163
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.603
<v Speaker 2>so they think if you're not a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you must be on some obscure fringe </v>

164
00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:56.340
<v Speaker 2>of the political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

165
00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I guess the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the understanding is growing,</v>

166
00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:03.600
<v Speaker 2>especially with the backlash against </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors,</v>

167
00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 2>which has really accelerated in the past</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 months.</v>

168
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.220
<v Speaker 2>So now these issues are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.113
<v Speaker 2>beginning to be brought to the fore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people are beginning to understand </v>

170
00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:17.331
<v Speaker 2>that libertarianism is a backlash </v>
<v Speaker 2>against authoritarianism,</v>

171
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.563
<v Speaker 2>which of course is embodied by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist third wave feminist social </v>

172
00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:22.470
<v Speaker 2>justice warrior movement.</v>

173
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

174
00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:23.934
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting all the buzzwords there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think it's really just a </v>

175
00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:27.294
<v Speaker 1>branding issue for Libertarians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's sort of no unifying </v>

176
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.134
<v Speaker 1>principle that's bringing us together </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than do what you'd like and don't </v>

177
00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:38.070
<v Speaker 1>harm someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just need sort of better.</v>

178
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:38.963
<v Speaker 1>There are a good reps basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least from what I see in the </v>

179
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.800
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a couple of Gary Johnson,</v>

180
00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:44.634
<v Speaker 1>former governor of New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had on the show and he's running for </v>

181
00:08:46.531 --> 00:08:47.364
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to gain traction when </v>

182
00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:49.680
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the outsiders.</v>

183
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking the problem with </v>

184
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism is they're not on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontier of political discourse.</v>

185
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 2>So when you get major issues that crop </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the news media,</v>

186
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 2>obviously as somebody who's politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>active,</v>

187
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.104
<v Speaker 2>you have to seize upon them and tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>your story and try and control change </v>

188
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:08.454
<v Speaker 2>that narrative as best you see fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Libertarians tend to get stuck in </v>

189
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 2>the weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:15.414
<v Speaker 2>they're always arguing with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>about these new issues and they're not </v>

191
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 2>really on the frontier of the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse,</v>

192
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.310
<v Speaker 2>which is more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

193
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.163
<v Speaker 2>now the domain of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of conservative areas and people who </v>

194
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:28.344
<v Speaker 2>oppose social justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think in America the libertarian </v>

195
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 2>movement is still so stuck in the weeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>and arguing,</v>

196
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my new shit between themselves that </v>

197
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 2>they're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

198
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.623
<v Speaker 2>a robust forces they could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one region in which they </v>

199
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 2>could improve by hijacking these key </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

200
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 2>these core issues like the migrant </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis and they're not doing that,</v>

201
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:53.724
<v Speaker 2>that they're debating with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>over what minute ism is and whether we </v>

202
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.853
<v Speaker 2>should have no government or limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and they have speeches and </v>

203
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.353
<v Speaker 2>three our youtube conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and they're not really reaching </v>

204
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 2>anyone outside their inner circle.</v>

205
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism needs to improve in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

207
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.003
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the silver lining to all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is that because of the social </v>

208
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:19.314
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior thing and now we can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into some of these issues is they're </v>

209
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 1>starting to push people into this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of libertarianism,</v>

210
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>which is nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

211
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

212
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>You are not a fan of the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior movement to put it mildly.</v>

213
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.161
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

214
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 1>when did you wake up to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you really see it as,</v>

215
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>as a threat to free speech?</v>

216
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 2>I think it was probably made 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

217
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:46.164
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was mainly covering geopolitical </v>

218
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 2>issues back in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013.</v>

219
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I was mainly on the Syrian civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the buildup,</v>

220
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.493
<v Speaker 2>the arms race that the confrontation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Russia over the course of 2013 to </v>

221
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:00.774
<v Speaker 2>2014 and then I became more active on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and it's only when you become </v>

222
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.933
<v Speaker 2>active on twitter and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually put some time into it and </v>

223
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:09.954
<v Speaker 2>follow the discourse that's taking place</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter that you realize that these </v>

224
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 2>issues are important because it's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer just,</v>

225
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demented 14 year olds on tumbler </v>

226
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 2>expressing that bizarre arcane </v>
<v Speaker 2>grievances.</v>

227
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:29.150
<v Speaker 2>These people are in the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are our future thought leaders that</v>

228
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.790
<v Speaker 2>are being cuddled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're being protected by professors at</v>

229
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:33.624
<v Speaker 2>these major universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was that connection between </v>

230
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 2>realizing that this is not just idiots </v>
<v Speaker 2>within opinion on twitter,</v>

231
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:41.754
<v Speaker 2>which is completely obscure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is now a really robust driving </v>

232
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:46.880
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

233
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

234
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 2>amongst millennials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

235
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 2>once you realize that once you realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's,</v>

236
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.493
<v Speaker 2>how it's infested the core of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>education system in America and now in </v>

237
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:57.784
<v Speaker 2>Britain as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me really symbolized how </v>

238
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:01.744
<v Speaker 2>important it was to oppose these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they oppose everything I stand </v>

239
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:06.710
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

240
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 2>within the tenets of libertarianism </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

241
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

242
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.910
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because I had very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>

243
00:12:11.911 --> 00:12:12.744
<v Speaker 1>probably around the same time a </v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening about this because it was a </v>

244
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.010
<v Speaker 1>lot on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

245
00:12:17.011 --> 00:12:17.844
<v Speaker 1>Because you're seeing this stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and you see the stuff from </v>

246
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:21.204
<v Speaker 1>tumbler that makes its way over and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people fighting about this stuff </v>

247
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.210
<v Speaker 1>that we hear about the trigger warnings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and safe spaces and all of this stuff.</v>

248
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.343
<v Speaker 1>But I could never really figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of this just existed for people </v>

249
00:12:33.241 --> 00:12:36.390
<v Speaker 1>behind computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically what you're saying is that</v>

250
00:12:36.391 --> 00:12:37.224
<v Speaker 1>there's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been a long time coming and </v>

251
00:12:38.431 --> 00:12:40.770
<v Speaker 1>that's what sorta has seeped into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university space.</v>

252
00:12:40.771 --> 00:12:41.604
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

253
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now it's becoming really physical.</v>

254
00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:46.914
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen the Bernie Sanders people </v>

255
00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:50.070
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to get into the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump thing lights,</v>

256
00:12:50.071 --> 00:12:51.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've sent.</v>

257
00:12:51.691 --> 00:12:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Our reporters are to Wisconsin this past</v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

258
00:12:54.061 --> 00:12:55.710
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

259
00:12:55.711 --> 00:12:59.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not just Bernie Sanders supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's leftist in general than other ones.</v>

260
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.743
<v Speaker 2>Vial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hateful people you could ever wish to </v>

261
00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:04.590
<v Speaker 2>meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

262
00:13:04.591 --> 00:13:05.424
<v Speaker 2>the Shia hatred that they give you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiates from their eyes when you so </v>

263
00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 2>much as disagree with them is palpable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they're out there.</v>

264
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.560
<v Speaker 2>They're shutting down these private </v>
<v Speaker 2>functions,</v>

265
00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:18.930
<v Speaker 2>these Donald Trump events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

266
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.793
<v Speaker 2>whether you agree with trump or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not your free speech First </v>

267
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Amendment right to shut down a private </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

268
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.790
<v Speaker 2>You're impinging on other people's First</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amendment by doing that.</v>

269
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.570
<v Speaker 2>And these people wave signs saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.580
<v Speaker 2>oppose hatred or bigotry that have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most hateful people you could imagine.</v>

271
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I see now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the translation from twitter,</v>

272
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.860
<v Speaker 2>now they're getting out on the streets </v>
<v Speaker 2>of girls.</v>

273
00:13:43.861 --> 00:13:48.630
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that with black lives matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>that metastasized into a similar,</v>

274
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.610
<v Speaker 2>hateful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violent movement.</v>

275
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.800
<v Speaker 2>And we might get into that later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

276
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

277
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.153
<v Speaker 2>it's manifesting physically now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's why people are worried about </v>

278
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.983
<v Speaker 2>civil unrest and riots quite frankly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these people are prone to </v>

279
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:03.990
<v Speaker 2>violence and they're very hateful </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

280
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:04.771
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

281
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:06.870
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna get into all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

282
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.733
<v Speaker 1>But you hit on a lot of things there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I've been </v>

283
00:14:09.001 --> 00:14:09.834
<v Speaker 1>saying is I can't believe we're at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in 2016 in America where I fear </v>

284
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.873
<v Speaker 1>that it will be us ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the citizens who will take away our </v>

285
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:20.610
<v Speaker 1>right to free speech more than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

286
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.623
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a first amendment issue in </v>

287
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:25.740
<v Speaker 1>these people protest because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government doing it,</v>

288
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.933
<v Speaker 1>but we do have a certain social contract</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to let people speak and </v>

289
00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:33.180
<v Speaker 1>then you can use your speech to </v>
<v Speaker 1>counteract it.</v>

290
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.223
<v Speaker 1>But basically you're saying by blocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>roads and by stopping people from </v>

291
00:14:37.951 --> 00:14:40.500
<v Speaker 1>speaking that that's where it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech issue,</v>

292
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.700
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily a first amendment issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

293
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.890
<v Speaker 1>You see that distinction?</v>

294
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.203
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got no problem with people being </v>

295
00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:47.864
<v Speaker 2>out on the streets protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the riots when they </v>

296
00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:50.624
<v Speaker 2>actually go Donald Trump events in </v>
<v Speaker 2>private buildings where they've paid to </v>

297
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Speaker 2>hire this building and they got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>event in Chicago canceled,</v>

298
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's impinging on other,</v>

299
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.493
<v Speaker 2>on other people's rights to peaceably </v>
<v Speaker 2>assemble exercise their first amendment </v>

300
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:08.660
<v Speaker 2>and just listen to somebody's speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

301
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:11.750
<v Speaker 2>as you touched on before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this whole idea of,</v>

302
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the,</v>

303
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 2>the power was in the media and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to talk about in the media later,</v>

304
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.323
<v Speaker 2>now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of invested back into the </v>

305
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 2>hands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people power,</v>

306
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:23.144
<v Speaker 2>but it's people power gone mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you have organized groups of </v>

307
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 2>people who go out to publicly shame </v>
<v Speaker 2>others to get them fired,</v>

308
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.483
<v Speaker 2>to censor content from the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how twitter in one sense </v>

309
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.143
<v Speaker 2>empowered the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it gave that power to these </v>

310
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 2>perpetually outraged mobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what woke me up to the social</v>

311
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:45.270
<v Speaker 2>justice warrior Su,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because as you said it,</v>

312
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Speaker 2>the concern for me for a few years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the states,</v>

313
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.740
<v Speaker 2>the government impinging on our free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech rights.</v>

314
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.873
<v Speaker 2>Now it's perpetually professionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>outraged mobs impinging on our free </v>

315
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:57.914
<v Speaker 2>speech rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the biggest danger right </v>

316
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 2>now in 2016 in comparison to anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the state's going to do.</v>

317
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so ironic.</v>

318
00:16:05.551 --> 00:16:06.384
<v Speaker 1>I can't even think of an example right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now in America where the state is </v>

319
00:16:10.831 --> 00:16:11.664
<v Speaker 1>holding the first amendment hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find one instance where you </v>

320
00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:18.900
<v Speaker 1>can't say whatever you want about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government or about government officials</v>

321
00:16:18.901 --> 00:16:19.734
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can see many instances where the </v>

322
00:16:21.661 --> 00:16:25.440
<v Speaker 1>mob and the online mob and they'll try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop your patrion funding if you're a</v>

323
00:16:25.441 --> 00:16:26.274
<v Speaker 1>youtuber or they'll try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>other ways to have you fired or shamed </v>

324
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.070
<v Speaker 1>or whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that these people,</v>

325
00:16:32.071 --> 00:16:32.904
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when trump was doing the rally in </v>

326
00:16:34.231 --> 00:16:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Arizona and they blocked the road in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>

327
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.213
<v Speaker 1>do you think that they thought that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were helping their cause because I get </v>

328
00:16:42.661 --> 00:16:44.370
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not all of these people are thinking</v>

329
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:47.100
<v Speaker 1>all their moves through properly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know they're going out.</v>

330
00:16:47.101 --> 00:16:49.320
<v Speaker 1>We're going to stop them from showing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all good,</v>

331
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but to me all they really do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthened trump because then look,</v>

332
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.510
<v Speaker 1>nobody that didn't get there is suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>not gonna vote for trump.</v>

333
00:16:57.511 --> 00:16:58.344
<v Speaker 1>It makes them want to vote for trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than everyone watching it on the </v>

334
00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:01.890
<v Speaker 1>news is going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

335
00:17:01.891 --> 00:17:04.740
<v Speaker 1>who's being oppressed here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually trump,</v>

336
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.390
<v Speaker 1>so it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating,</v>

337
00:17:06.391 --> 00:17:07.224
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

338
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.873
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they've got any idea of </v>

339
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:11.774
<v Speaker 2>how ridiculous they look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've got this media narrative </v>

340
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 2>backing them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that trump is inciting violence</v>

341
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:20.120
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I've been hot</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

342
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with trump on everything.</v>

343
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:23.354
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a vehement trump supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go on twitter on any single </v>

344
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 2>day and search for assassinate trump or </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill trump,</v>

345
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you will find hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples.</v>

346
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Obviously most people don't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to do anything,</v>

347
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.823
<v Speaker 2>but they're threatening to assassinate </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump and yet the whole media narrative </v>

348
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.813
<v Speaker 2>is about how trump supports as a violent</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how trump himself is inciting </v>

349
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:51.780
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a video on youtube right now and</v>

350
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 2>we complain about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 2>to a TSA censoring conservatives for </v>
<v Speaker 2>having the wrong political opinion.</v>

352
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.103
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy who's still on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His account hasn't been touched by the </v>

353
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.710
<v Speaker 2>trust and safety council.</v>

354
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a youtube video which calls for</v>

355
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 2>caving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump's head in with a shovel,</v>

356
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:09.743
<v Speaker 2>shooting him with an AK 47.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Filling him full of bullets is not even </v>

357
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.380
<v Speaker 2>age restricted on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

358
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:21.381
<v Speaker 2>I've had videos age restricted for swear</v>
<v Speaker 2>words and the media came out afterwards.</v>

359
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.780
<v Speaker 2>This is a rap video out of a Baltimore </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbuildable dot.</v>

360
00:18:28.121 --> 00:18:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Come celebrate today as a powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest song.</v>

361
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 2>This is a group of young men in a rap </v>
<v Speaker 2>video threatening to kill Donald Trump.</v>

362
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.013
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you know the Oregon militia </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whoever had come out with a video </v>

363
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 2>threatening to assassinate Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>

364
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.893
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the media would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrating it as a powerful protest </v>

365
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:47.574
<v Speaker 2>song?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's that double standard they're </v>

366
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:50.094
<v Speaker 2>given left media cover because we've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>this narrative that trump's inciting </v>

367
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:54.894
<v Speaker 2>violence when again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the most hateful violent people </v>

368
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.610
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

369
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fascinating because as you've </v>

370
00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:01.970
<v Speaker 1>repeated several times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

371
00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you're not even a huge trump supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet you're,</v>

372
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you are put in a position where you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend some of these ideals.</v>

373
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a trump supporter and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way.</v>

374
00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:14.180
<v Speaker 1>If I want to stand up for the ideals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I stand for,</v>

375
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I have to call this nonsense out because</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently no one in the media do it.</v>

376
00:19:18.771 --> 00:19:20.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another great example of that.</v>

377
00:19:20.301 --> 00:19:21.134
<v Speaker 1>Did you see a couple of weeks ago when </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy tried to bum rush trump on </v>

378
00:19:24.111 --> 00:19:24.944
<v Speaker 1>stage and then the next night he was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>cnn and all the news channels and they </v>

379
00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:33.050
<v Speaker 1>were treating him as if he was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>legit voice of counter protests,</v>

380
00:19:33.051 --> 00:19:33.884
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile he was trying to attack a </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential candidate whether you like </v>

381
00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.270
<v Speaker 1>trump or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

382
00:19:38.271 --> 00:19:39.104
<v Speaker 1>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fully the fault of the media </v>

383
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:41.024
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.721
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

385
00:19:42.721 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean you flip it around if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a right winger tried to attack Bernie</v>

386
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.843
<v Speaker 2>Sanders or Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he wouldn't be on CNN the next day </v>

387
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 2>being given a complimentary welcoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>

388
00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Yet we see this again and again and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

389
00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:57.624
<v Speaker 2>trump is a creation of social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>warriors at the end of the day have </v>

390
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 2>reaction as an equal and opposite </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction and people are just tired.</v>

391
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.280
<v Speaker 2>That tired of being lectured about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist they are.</v>

392
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.253
<v Speaker 2>They're tired about being lectured to </v>
<v Speaker 2>check their privilege and whether you </v>

393
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:13.044
<v Speaker 2>agree with trump or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't agree with them on things </v>

394
00:20:14.551 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 2>like torture or surveillance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the backlash.</v>

395
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people who support trump,</v>

396
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.483
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so condescended towards by the </v>

397
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had to work for everything they</v>

398
00:20:26.971 --> 00:20:27.804
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are mainly quite poor blue collar </v>

399
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:32.340
<v Speaker 2>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the supporting trump,</v>

400
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.780
<v Speaker 2>but they're sick of being made to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty about who they are,</v>

401
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.940
<v Speaker 2>but the establishment still doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize that fact and just labels them</v>

402
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:44.520
<v Speaker 2>racists and bigots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still don't get it.</v>

403
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 2>They still don't get what's driving this</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon.</v>

404
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 2>And it might end up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

405
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.750
<v Speaker 2>slapping them in the face.</v>

406
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think it,</v>

407
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:51.563
<v Speaker 1>it slapping them in the face right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much of this do you think his </v>

408
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:55.474
<v Speaker 1>establishment politicians and just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment on both the Democrats and </v>

409
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:00.274
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans in bed with the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've all gotten so fat for so </v>

410
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:05.014
<v Speaker 1>long that they've all just asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible questions and no good follow </v>

411
00:21:08.631 --> 00:21:12.220
<v Speaker 1>ups and they've all just been in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>game for so long that they.</v>

412
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:13.054
<v Speaker 1>Their fear of trump is that he's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave a lot of these guys without a </v>

413
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:16.264
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these pundits on TV and all </v>

414
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 1>these people who have professionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten everything wrong for years,</v>

415
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 1>but they've had a gig and a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I think think,</v>

416
00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:26.464
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have a gig if trump </v>

417
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:28.340
<v Speaker 1>gets in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're.</v>

418
00:21:28.341 --> 00:21:31.030
<v Speaker 1>They're protecting their own assets more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anything else.</v>

419
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely part of it.</v>

420
00:21:33.771 --> 00:21:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other department is,</v>

421
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is self funded.</v>

422
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.650
<v Speaker 2>He's a maverick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be a rich,</v>

423
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.090
<v Speaker 2>bigoted buffoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's unpredictable and the elite,</v>

424
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:44.953
<v Speaker 2>the establishment of the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment is used to having not one </v>

425
00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 2>but two candidates and every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential race that they control.</v>

426
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go back to 2004 Bush and Kerry,</v>

427
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.190
<v Speaker 2>both skull and bones members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

428
00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's business as usual for the </v>

429
00:22:00.081 --> 00:22:03.110
<v Speaker 2>political elite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody like trump comes along,</v>

430
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.060
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a loose cannon.</v>

431
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.880
<v Speaker 2>He's unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what he's going to do.</v>

432
00:22:07.881 --> 00:22:08.714
<v Speaker 2>I think if he got in power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would immediately start moderating </v>

433
00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:16.010
<v Speaker 2>his rhetoric or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're scared stiff because it's simply</v>

434
00:22:16.011 --> 00:22:18.590
<v Speaker 2>an unknown quantity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you said,</v>

435
00:22:18.591 --> 00:22:19.424
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people in the establishment who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have relied on this status quo for so </v>

436
00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:25.040
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for decades,</v>

437
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.930
<v Speaker 2>an hour petrified because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

438
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.010
<v Speaker 2>he's come along and up the apple </v>
<v Speaker 2>applecart people are scared.</v>

439
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you view this all is just a big </v>

440
00:22:33.981 --> 00:22:36.210
<v Speaker 1>negotiating ploy with him because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

441
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I was seeing this week he made this </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment that,</v>

442
00:22:38.871 --> 00:22:39.704
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Japan should have nukes and </v>

443
00:22:41.811 --> 00:22:42.644
<v Speaker 1>everyone is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then he's going to start a nuclear </v>

444
00:22:43.671 --> 00:22:47.030
<v Speaker 1>arms race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he really was saying was either</v>

445
00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:47.864
<v Speaker 1>Japan should be able to defend itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nukes because North Korea is there </v>

446
00:22:50.421 --> 00:22:54.410
<v Speaker 1>and China and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they should pay us to defend them,</v>

447
00:22:54.411 --> 00:22:58.310
<v Speaker 1>meaning pay the United States because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically have agreements that we defend</v>

448
00:22:58.311 --> 00:22:59.144
<v Speaker 1>them militarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that crazy of a proposal </v>

449
00:23:02.001 --> 00:23:03.870
<v Speaker 1>that we should be paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

450
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.570
<v Speaker 1>if you're a celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay your body guard.</v>

451
00:23:05.571 --> 00:23:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think a lot of this is that he</v>

452
00:23:07.881 --> 00:23:11.270
<v Speaker 1>just throws this stuff out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then gets misquoted.</v>

453
00:23:11.271 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media runs with a tie.</v>

454
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.530
<v Speaker 1>He really wants to start a nuclear arms </v>
<v Speaker 1>race and then people.</v>

455
00:23:15.531 --> 00:23:17.630
<v Speaker 1>It even strengthens him more because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then people go,</v>

456
00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:20.870
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't that crazy of a proposal.</v>

457
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.113
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just run with the banner headline </v>

458
00:23:24.501 --> 00:23:25.334
<v Speaker 2>that suits their agenda and as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you actually drill down into what </v>

459
00:23:27.771 --> 00:23:30.110
<v Speaker 2>he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it makes a lot of sense.</v>

460
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:30.944
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he just missed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaks and tylee back a few months ago </v>

461
00:23:34.261 --> 00:23:35.094
<v Speaker 2>and he advocated bringing in Syrian </v>
<v Speaker 2>refugees and within 24 hours completely </v>

462
00:23:39.231 --> 00:23:41.780
<v Speaker 2>reversed his position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's partly that,</v>

463
00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:47.050
<v Speaker 2>but geo politically from a geopolitical </v>
<v Speaker 2>standpoint is better than anyone else.</v>

464
00:23:47.311 --> 00:23:48.144
<v Speaker 2>And definitely Hilary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they call it trump is laminate </v>

465
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:51.374
<v Speaker 2>phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not the one who voted for a wall </v>

466
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 2>that killed a million Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

467
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:57.614
<v Speaker 2>he's not the one that supported regime </v>
<v Speaker 2>change in Syria and Libya that led to </v>

468
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 2>this migrant crisis in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton did.</v>

469
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.153
<v Speaker 2>He's not the one who's amping up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>world war three with Russia as every </v>

470
00:24:10.941 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>other single gop candidate has during </v>
<v Speaker 2>the debates.</v>

471
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's all this rhetoric about,</v>

472
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

473
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.463
<v Speaker 2>the world's going to explode the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump gets into office because he's so </v>

474
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 2>crazy and out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you actually look at his prior record</v>

475
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 2>and what he's advocating in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>America's military role in the world,</v>

476
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 2>it's the most peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely out of all the gop candidates</v>

477
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 2>and definitely over and above Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton who voted for the Iraq war.</v>

478
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

479
00:24:40.161 --> 00:24:40.994
<v Speaker 1>I was at a very liberal progressive la </v>
<v Speaker 1>party this weekend and people were </v>

480
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:50.510
<v Speaker 1>freaking out over trump and I kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to say to them,</v>

481
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fear trump,</v>

482
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:55.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're a liberal or a progressive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone on the left,</v>

483
00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 1>you should fear Ted Cruz far more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fear Donald trump.</v>

484
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.110
<v Speaker 1>But I couldn't get people to quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why.</v>

485
00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.180
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of amazed by that.</v>

486
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because they don't read.</v>

487
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:09.124
<v Speaker 2>I mean not.</v>

488
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.633
<v Speaker 1>Hi Guys.</v>

489
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.163
<v Speaker 2>They don't read beyond headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you actually listened to trump </v>

490
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.500
<v Speaker 2>speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he rambles on for an hour or so,</v>

491
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:20.150
<v Speaker 2>but if you actually listened to most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

492
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:25.190
<v Speaker 2>most of his speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a devoted to things like trade deals,</v>

493
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is why people are voting for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

494
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:28.603
<v Speaker 2>It's the reaction to the lost jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the ruined towns in middle America </v>

495
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.913
<v Speaker 2>because of Nafta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of these trade deals that have </v>

496
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 2>screwed them over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you map his supporters,</v>

497
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.280
<v Speaker 2>it correlates almost directly with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial,</v>

498
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.173
<v Speaker 2>the industrialization and despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These areas of America that have been </v>

499
00:25:47.451 --> 00:25:48.284
<v Speaker 2>completely abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely left to rot by these trade </v>

500
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:52.364
<v Speaker 2>deals that have resulted in the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucking sound of these jobs leaving </v>

501
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:58.340
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So watch his speeches.</v>

502
00:25:58.341 --> 00:25:59.174
<v Speaker 2>They are liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A progressive will never watch his </v>

503
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 2>speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not mainly about building a wall.</v>

504
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:08.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not mainly about banning Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mainly about trade.</v>

505
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.163
<v Speaker 2>And that's why he has a lot of support </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst blue collar workers because </v>

506
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:15.740
<v Speaker 2>people's jobs have been shipped abroad </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're furious about it.</v>

507
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's mainly a left wing position </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be complaining about.</v>

508
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Life has been in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting that most liberals</v>

509
00:26:23.271 --> 00:26:24.104
<v Speaker 2>just aren't aware of the main body of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his actual speech and why people are </v>

510
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:29.060
<v Speaker 2>attracted to his campaign.</v>

511
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Well that's like when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tweet out,</v>

512
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.181
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

513
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 1>trump ties are made in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

514
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:35.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a hypocrite he is.</v>

515
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a hypocrite.</v>

516
00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:38.384
<v Speaker 1>That shows he's a good businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's used are shitty trade deals that </v>

517
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:47.021
<v Speaker 1>our politicians have signed to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money here and he's saying I will change</v>

518
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:48.114
<v Speaker 1>those deals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people like me won't have to do that </v>

519
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 1>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's lost on all my liberal friends.</v>

520
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:54.000
<v Speaker 1>No matter how many times I bring that </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

521
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also what's lost,</v>

522
00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.760
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the lines of people going</v>
<v Speaker 2>into these trump events,</v>

523
00:27:01.761 --> 00:27:02.594
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had reports in Wisconsin this </v>

524
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:04.821
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:27:04.821 --> 00:27:05.654
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Asian Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a few black people in fight back </v>

526
00:27:08.871 --> 00:27:09.704
<v Speaker 2>when Rubio was in the rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump had more than double the support </v>

527
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.720
<v Speaker 2>for Muslim Americans than every other </v>
<v Speaker 2>gop candidate combined.</v>

528
00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:23.020
<v Speaker 2>He set to break records for black votes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to support for a Republican candidate.</v>

529
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.343
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this narrative that it's just about </v>

530
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.653
<v Speaker 2>bigotry and racism is just surface crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You delve a little bit below and you </v>

531
00:27:31.371 --> 00:27:35.090
<v Speaker 2>have to understand the wider phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why he has this support.</v>

532
00:27:35.091 --> 00:27:37.400
<v Speaker 2>This is our complete political </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>

533
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.130
<v Speaker 2>This is about an overthrow of the status</v>
<v Speaker 2>quo.</v>

534
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.273
<v Speaker 2>Americans are sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now finally that putting that vote </v>

535
00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:46.790
<v Speaker 2>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be for trump or sanders.</v>

536
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:47.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's move away from trump a little </v>

537
00:27:49.071 --> 00:27:49.904
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to back up to something you said </v>

538
00:27:50.721 --> 00:27:53.090
<v Speaker 1>about Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hillary in your eyes,</v>

539
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of obviously all the connections</v>

540
00:27:55.671 --> 00:27:56.504
<v Speaker 1>between her husband and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment connections that she's </v>

541
00:27:59.331 --> 00:28:00.164
<v Speaker 1>been involved in this forever from being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a first lady to a senator and secretary </v>

542
00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:03.314
<v Speaker 1>of state and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's absolutely who the establishment </v>

543
00:28:05.901 --> 00:28:06.471
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

544
00:28:06.471 --> 00:28:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you see any wiggle room on that?</v>

545
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the establishment behind Hillary?</v>

546
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:13.900
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

547
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I went to build a Burg in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Denmark in 2014,</v>

548
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Austria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand and 50.</v>

549
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.890
<v Speaker 2>And even back then we got the inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>leak from the Bilderberg group meeting,</v>

550
00:28:23.891 --> 00:28:28.210
<v Speaker 2>which is this conference at 120 </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential bankers,</v>

551
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.650
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>academics,</v>

552
00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.400
<v Speaker 2>and even back then they had come </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and said,</v>

553
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Hillary's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pick for 2016,</v>

554
00:28:35.711 --> 00:28:38.320
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try and defund all her </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

555
00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.540
<v Speaker 2>So years back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary was there,</v>

556
00:28:40.541 --> 00:28:41.374
<v Speaker 2>pick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

557
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.670
<v Speaker 2>in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she took the fall for Obama and that was</v>

558
00:28:45.671 --> 00:28:48.160
<v Speaker 2>decided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a meeting in chantilly,</v>

559
00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.203
<v Speaker 2>coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same location where the Bilderberg </v>

560
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.540
<v Speaker 2>meeting was taking place back in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

561
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Hillary's been a shoe in for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>now for the elite.</v>

562
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 1>So where does this put sanders in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>

563
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants a lot of the changes,</v>

564
00:29:03.451 --> 00:29:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically,</v>

565
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.950
<v Speaker 1>sanders and trump are talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the same stuff,</v>

566
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:08.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both want to severely changed the </v>

567
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:12.930
<v Speaker 1>power structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the system,</v>

568
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 1>yet their supporters seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely hate each other.</v>

569
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.213
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I suspect you agree with some of the </v>

570
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 1>heart of sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not the policy.</v>

571
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.363
<v Speaker 2>I can't bring myself to agree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who says that bread lines </v>

572
00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.570
<v Speaker 2>aren't necessarily a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

573
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.930
<v Speaker 2>this idea that Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters,</v>

574
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.063
<v Speaker 2>if he loses to Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which looks like it's almost certainly </v>

575
00:29:36.261 --> 00:29:37.094
<v Speaker 2>going to happen and then going to go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote for trump because he's the other </v>

576
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:41.024
<v Speaker 2>antiestablishment option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't buy that because for the </v>

577
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 2>very reason you just said they </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely hated each other.</v>

578
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:48.603
<v Speaker 2>I don't think many of Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters a rarely jive with his </v>

579
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 2>antiestablishment credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they jive more with this extreme</v>

580
00:29:57.371 --> 00:30:01.300
<v Speaker 2>left wing social justice warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro socialist pro,</v>

581
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.193
<v Speaker 2>massive welfare state position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I can't bring myself to agree </v>

582
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:06.454
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just from the behavior of his </v>

583
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:09.004
<v Speaker 2>supporters over the past couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>months has really turned me off to </v>

584
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:15.680
<v Speaker 2>anything that Bernie Sanders stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>

585
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

586
00:30:16.911 --> 00:30:17.744
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I've ever felt this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way about a candidate and I don't even </v>

587
00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:20.684
<v Speaker 1>know that I could have made this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like him more than I liked the </v>

588
00:30:24.111 --> 00:30:26.840
<v Speaker 1>reasons that people are supporting him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

589
00:30:26.841 --> 00:30:29.030
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I was telling Milo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos a couple of weeks ago,</v>

590
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I think he himself is a decent guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether I disagree with him or not,</v>

591
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.633
<v Speaker 1>but the underpinnings of what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing I think are really dangerous </v>

592
00:30:38.031 --> 00:30:38.864
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I fear and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange place to feel about a candidate </v>

593
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:42.763
<v Speaker 1>when you like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't like what they're sort of </v>

594
00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:46.124
<v Speaker 1>bringing along with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I've ever felt that </v>

595
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:48.650
<v Speaker 1>way before about somebody.</v>

596
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:50.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

597
00:30:50.421 --> 00:30:53.660
<v Speaker 2>and it's the same reason that the trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon has happened.</v>

598
00:30:53.661 --> 00:30:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>

599
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a maverick.</v>

600
00:30:57.471 --> 00:31:00.110
<v Speaker 2>He's unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't be able to buy him off.</v>

601
00:31:00.111 --> 00:31:03.230
<v Speaker 2>So whatever his policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I fundamentally disagree with,</v>

602
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.363
<v Speaker 2>you still represents a threats of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment because he's an unknown </v>

603
00:31:07.641 --> 00:31:09.430
<v Speaker 2>quantity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that's,</v>

604
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.410
<v Speaker 2>that's why sanders has paralleled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump phenomenon,</v>

605
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.870
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the way it looks now,</v>

606
00:31:14.871 --> 00:31:18.320
<v Speaker 2>he's basically no chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it remains to be seen what's going to</v>

607
00:31:18.321 --> 00:31:19.154
<v Speaker 2>happen to his voters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I very much doubt they're going to </v>

608
00:31:21.771 --> 00:31:25.130
<v Speaker 2>go over to trump in the kind of numbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are suggesting.</v>

609
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with the sanders people,</v>

610
00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:28.434
<v Speaker 1>my sense is that a lot of them really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to just burn the system down and </v>

611
00:31:33.421 --> 00:31:35.460
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of why I can't get behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because yeah,</v>

612
00:31:35.461 --> 00:31:40.080
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of problems in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done bad things internationally.</v>

613
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.943
<v Speaker 1>There's too much money in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a fair economic system or all </v>

614
00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:48.660
<v Speaker 1>kinds of stuff that I can get on board </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the ideas of what he says.</v>

615
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.823
<v Speaker 1>But there's still something pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in America and I think we forget </v>

616
00:31:52.861 --> 00:31:53.694
<v Speaker 1>that as Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I fear is that these </v>

617
00:31:56.011 --> 00:31:59.790
<v Speaker 1>people want to actually burn the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and I'm afraid if you burn it down,</v>

618
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:00.923
<v Speaker 1>what rises out of those ashes is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be any better or at least the </v>

619
00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:06.060
<v Speaker 1>chances of it being any better or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

620
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.193
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when his support as a carrying around </v>

621
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:14.641
<v Speaker 2>hammer and sickle communist flags and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about a socialist revolution,</v>

622
00:32:14.951 --> 00:32:15.784
<v Speaker 2>I mean that gives me the jitters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can look at sanders </v>

623
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

624
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have a job until he was 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

625
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.720
<v Speaker 2>He was basically a mom living on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flaws of other people's palms.</v>

626
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's personal lifestyle kind of turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>me off towards him as well.</v>

627
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:35.200
<v Speaker 2>But as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of things,</v>

628
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:40.201
<v Speaker 2>his support as advocate or in many cases</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot worse than what he's advocating.</v>

629
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:41.983
<v Speaker 2>So they want to tear the system down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they basically want to replace it </v>

630
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 2>with outright communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them,</v>

631
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to this,</v>

632
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resist capitalism.</v>

633
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag that was on twitter a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago.</v>

634
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.420
<v Speaker 2>These people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:32:56.421 --> 00:33:00.670
<v Speaker 2>they're probably aged 20 to 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got no idea whatsoever.</v>

636
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 2>The absolute horror that communism has </v>
<v Speaker 2>role on the world over the last 50,</v>

637
00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:08.210
<v Speaker 2>60 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we keep having to,</v>

638
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that debate over and over again of </v>

639
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:16.070
<v Speaker 2>why communism is bad and why leaving </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to their own devices and building</v>

640
00:33:16.071 --> 00:33:16.904
<v Speaker 2>a free market economy is good because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this fundamental ignorance </v>

641
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:21.644
<v Speaker 2>surrounding capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think that the system of </v>

642
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 2>capitalism we've got now is free market </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

643
00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.310
<v Speaker 2>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's corporatism crony capitalism,</v>

644
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.920
<v Speaker 2>but they think that that's free market </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism,</v>

645
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:38.210
<v Speaker 2>which is why they go to the extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>other end of the equation and think that</v>

646
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.350
<v Speaker 2>communism is the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When history has proven that it's not,</v>

647
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:43.363
<v Speaker 2>we keep having to recycle that argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again because a lot of </v>

648
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:49.490
<v Speaker 2>these millennials just don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

649
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.363
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of detangling some of the </v>

650
00:33:52.051 --> 00:33:55.560
<v Speaker 1>crony capitalism and some of the Wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>Street money and all that stuff,</v>

651
00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.020
<v Speaker 1>which he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is extremely legit,</v>

652
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.153
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to burn the whole thing </v>

653
00:33:59.551 --> 00:34:00.840
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to become communists,</v>

654
00:34:00.841 --> 00:34:01.890
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

655
00:34:01.891 --> 00:34:02.724
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of the Bernie support is </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a mixed with the black lives </v>

656
00:34:07.621 --> 00:34:09.230
<v Speaker 1>matter support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

657
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've been saying about</v>

658
00:34:10.621 --> 00:34:11.454
<v Speaker 1>the black lives matter movement is their</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions are good and somehow what's </v>

659
00:34:15.091 --> 00:34:18.960
<v Speaker 1>happened to the movement seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been hijacked or derailed by,</v>

660
00:34:18.961 --> 00:34:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would call far leftists.</v>

661
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you agree with that or do you think </v>

662
00:34:23.701 --> 00:34:26.010
<v Speaker 1>the movement was always that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you see it now?</v>

663
00:34:26.011 --> 00:34:26.844
<v Speaker 1>Where do you see it going?</v>

664
00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.403
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

665
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 2>back in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2014,</v>

666
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:37.100
<v Speaker 2>myself and Info wars were on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forefront of exposing police brutality.</v>

667
00:34:37.101 --> 00:34:42.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably 25 percent of my content</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day was about police brutality.</v>

668
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:44.263
<v Speaker 2>Now that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole narrative has been hijacked </v>

669
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:46.814
<v Speaker 2>by black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you less enthusiastic to </v>

670
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 2>actually talk about police brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effect that they've had.</v>

671
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.123
<v Speaker 2>And the polls show this is massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>support for police departments across </v>

672
00:34:59.031 --> 00:34:59.864
<v Speaker 2>the United States because the tactics </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they engage in a so divisive and </v>

673
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:05.624
<v Speaker 2>turn ordinary Americans off to such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that now a lot of people simply </v>

674
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:10.724
<v Speaker 2>would immediately support the police </v>
<v Speaker 2>even in a flagrant case of police </v>

675
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:16.300
<v Speaker 2>brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

676
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.143
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go back to the founding of </v>

677
00:35:18.171 --> 00:35:19.004
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously a lot of well meaning people </v>

678
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:23.630
<v Speaker 2>jumped on board in the first six months </v>
<v Speaker 2>or so,</v>

679
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.350
<v Speaker 2>but the inspiration behind black lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>

680
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.483
<v Speaker 2>and this is the woman that the three </v>
<v Speaker 2>female founders of that embryonic group </v>

681
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:36.940
<v Speaker 2>said was their inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a woman named the softer Chicago.</v>

682
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.453
<v Speaker 2>Now she's on the FBI's most wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist list because she killed a cop </v>

683
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:47.790
<v Speaker 2>in New Jersey back in the seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then fled to Cuba.</v>

684
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.450
<v Speaker 2>This is a woman who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.423
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter activists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They invoke her name at nearly every </v>

686
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:54.234
<v Speaker 2>rally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a domestic terrorist who left the </v>

687
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Black Panther party because it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent enough.</v>

688
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.060
<v Speaker 2>She joined the Black Liberation Army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

689
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:03.894
<v Speaker 2>this was another domestic terror group </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was involved in bombings and </v>

690
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 2>assassinations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing police officers.</v>

691
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.740
<v Speaker 2>So when you have that kind of guru,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that inspiration behind the movement,</v>

692
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.830
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's going to tend towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

693
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.023
<v Speaker 2>You had black lives matter protesters in</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York walking down the street </v>

694
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 2>chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we want?</v>

695
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Dead Cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When do we want them?</v>

696
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:26.874
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only going to turn people </v>

697
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 2>away from your movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not an inclusive movement.</v>

698
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.993
<v Speaker 2>It's been a divisive movement since </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost the beginning since just after </v>

699
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:38.064
<v Speaker 2>the first ferguson protests and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only got worse as it's been hijacked by </v>

700
00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:44.610
<v Speaker 2>all these opportunists and operatives.</v>

701
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for you,</v>

702
00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:46.704
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys were ahead on this stuff and I </v>

703
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:49.194
<v Speaker 1>remember seeing a lot of videos that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys were doing where you were talking </v>

704
00:36:52.201 --> 00:36:53.034
<v Speaker 1>about police brutality before it had </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bubbled up into the mainstream </v>

705
00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:57.084
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it must be extremely depressing for </v>

706
00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 1>you as someone that is in this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about this,</v>

707
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.753
<v Speaker 1>you understand that there was something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good here and as you just laid out that </v>

708
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 1>it has been derailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

709
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.530
<v Speaker 1>how do you get it back to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it too late?</v>

710
00:37:10.531 --> 00:37:11.364
<v Speaker 1>Is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the wave already gone to to get it </v>

711
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:14.634
<v Speaker 1>back to what was right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dealing with legit issues about police </v>

712
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:18.054
<v Speaker 1>brutality?</v>

713
00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the entire movement Blm was founded</v>

714
00:37:22.871 --> 00:37:23.704
<v Speaker 2>on this Michael Brown case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole hands up don't shoot mess and </v>

715
00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.120
<v Speaker 2>the media pedaled that for six months or</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

716
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.103
<v Speaker 2>the autopsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it turned out that was </v>

717
00:37:33.731 --> 00:37:36.180
<v Speaker 2>complete bs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never had his hands are,</v>

718
00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.293
<v Speaker 2>so they base all their grievances on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these completely fraudulent cases and </v>

719
00:37:41.201 --> 00:37:44.130
<v Speaker 2>then you have a case like Eric Garner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a,</v>

720
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a legitimate acts of police brutality,</v>

721
00:37:46.541 --> 00:37:49.450
<v Speaker 2>which we support the victim in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

722
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:50.583
<v Speaker 2>but they tend to base all their </v>
<v Speaker 2>grievances on these ridiculous cases </v>

723
00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.760
<v Speaker 2>that are obviously justified use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>force by the police.</v>

724
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's difficult to see how we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get back to,</v>

725
00:38:01.211 --> 00:38:02.044
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rational conversation about it when </v>

726
00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:05.620
<v Speaker 2>these people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:38:05.621 --> 00:38:09.280
<v Speaker 2>invoking the inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guru or the domestic terrorists,</v>

728
00:38:09.281 --> 00:38:11.710
<v Speaker 2>they're chanting for dead cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

729
00:38:11.711 --> 00:38:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you had people planned to bomb the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferguson police station.</v>

730
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:20.050
<v Speaker 2>You had the cops that were killed in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York as part of a black lives matter,</v>

731
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.063
<v Speaker 2>revenge attack by Ishmael Brinsley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it attracts those kinds of </v>

732
00:38:24.701 --> 00:38:26.320
<v Speaker 2>extremists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at this point,</v>

733
00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.573
<v Speaker 2>I call it a domestic hate group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this was a bunch of why Oregon </v>

734
00:38:31.271 --> 00:38:32.104
<v Speaker 2>militia members who were chanting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>black cops to killed black people to be </v>

735
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:37.264
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who some of them were actually planning </v>

736
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:42.340
<v Speaker 2>to do that and who's ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration was?</v>

737
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Timothy Mcveigh for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media wouldn't get behind that,</v>

738
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 2>but we've seen elements of the media get</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind black lives matter.</v>

739
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:51.040
<v Speaker 2>We've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

740
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine in defense of rioting.</v>

741
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.620
<v Speaker 2>So they built this whole grievance </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

742
00:38:56.621 --> 00:38:57.454
<v Speaker 2>It was supported by some elements of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>this media and now you've got Hillary </v>

743
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.063
<v Speaker 2>Clinton meeting with black lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet a is back a few months ago saying </v>

744
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.023
<v Speaker 2>she's prepared to change laws for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is very divisive </v>

745
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:11.764
<v Speaker 2>destructive movement and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>de-legitimized genuine opposition to </v>

746
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:16.624
<v Speaker 2>police brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an su and continues to be an </v>

747
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Su,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now people are so turned off towards</v>

748
00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

749
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:25.720
<v Speaker 2>the polls show that people don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter.</v>

750
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 2>They're now more likely to support </v>
<v Speaker 2>police.</v>

751
00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

752
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.860
<v Speaker 1>a perfect example of that would be sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you alluded to,</v>

753
00:39:31.861 --> 00:39:32.694
<v Speaker 1>which is what happened in Oregon here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what two months ago when you know the </v>

754
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.473
<v Speaker 1>cliven Bundy people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took over basically a vacant lot </v>

755
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:41.903
<v Speaker 1>house office and everyone I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my progressive friends were </v>

756
00:39:45.931 --> 00:39:48.570
<v Speaker 1>screaming about what terrorists they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic terrorists.</v>

757
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walked into a federal building.</v>

758
00:39:51.031 --> 00:39:51.864
<v Speaker 1>Even if nobody was there in the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was unlocked with weapons and I think </v>

759
00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:57.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe one person did die somehow related</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it or something that.</v>

760
00:39:57.691 --> 00:39:58.890
<v Speaker 1>You could correct me if I'm wrong on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

761
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:04.730
<v Speaker 1>but there was such outrage over that </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there was virtually no violence.</v>

762
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.023
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending everything that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did versus the lack of outrage when </v>

763
00:40:10.021 --> 00:40:10.854
<v Speaker 1>there's actual violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything comes down to race at the </v>

764
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:14.910
<v Speaker 1>end of the day with the progresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

765
00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

766
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.793
<v Speaker 2>that was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a young guy hold up there in </v>

767
00:40:19.161 --> 00:40:20.780
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the wildlife center,</v>

768
00:40:20.781 --> 00:40:21.614
<v Speaker 2>right at the end of that situation who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was threatening to kill himself and it </v>

769
00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.440
<v Speaker 2>was being broadcast live on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

770
00:40:27.441 --> 00:40:29.480
<v Speaker 2>It was [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a tragic situation,</v>

771
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.670
<v Speaker 2>but on twitter you had all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regressive,</v>

772
00:40:31.671 --> 00:40:32.504
<v Speaker 2>celebrating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling him a racist and saying you </v>

773
00:40:34.941 --> 00:40:35.774
<v Speaker 2>should shoot himself in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hadn't Lavoy finicum who was in the </v>

774
00:40:38.721 --> 00:40:43.700
<v Speaker 2>vehicle with a couple of these other </v>
<v Speaker 2>protests as females traveling through.</v>

775
00:40:43.701 --> 00:40:46.340
<v Speaker 2>They say FBI roadblock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets out of the car,</v>

776
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:50.930
<v Speaker 2>he gets gunned down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God knows two dozen times or whatever.</v>

777
00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.720
<v Speaker 2>That was a shady situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

778
00:40:53.721 --> 00:40:56.270
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a complete lack of outrage.</v>

779
00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.860
<v Speaker 2>They filled the car with bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

780
00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.873
<v Speaker 2>it's a surprise that these are the women</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were unarmed and we're not showing </v>

781
00:41:02.631 --> 00:41:05.510
<v Speaker 2>any resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get slaughtered themselves,</v>

782
00:41:05.511 --> 00:41:10.490
<v Speaker 2>but on the left there was no outrage </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever because they weren't black.</v>

783
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:11.363
<v Speaker 2>I think we should treat everybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a victim of police brutality the same </v>

784
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.780
<v Speaker 2>regardless of race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because they don't do that,</v>

785
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.793
<v Speaker 2>it turns white middle class America away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their movement and it prevents us </v>

786
00:41:22.881 --> 00:41:27.380
<v Speaker 2>from becoming truly united and </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing police brutality.</v>

787
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it right there.</v>

788
00:41:29.021 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 1>There are unintended consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do actually drive drive people</v>

789
00:41:33.831 --> 00:41:36.440
<v Speaker 1>the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say to.</v>

790
00:41:36.441 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I have progressive friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them,</v>

791
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:39.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are talk to me anymore,</v>

792
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:41.990
<v Speaker 1>but I had progressive friends that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

793
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.360
<v Speaker 1>when we discuss this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say,</v>

794
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of violence.</v>

795
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:46.604
<v Speaker 1>If you really want social change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of violence is </v>

796
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:49.724
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you buy that at all or do you think </v>

797
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 1>that's just an excuse because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get headlines If,</v>

798
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.440
<v Speaker 1>if there isn't a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

799
00:41:57.441 --> 00:41:59.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just have a peaceful protest,</v>

800
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 1>the media doesn't show up.</v>

801
00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:02.943
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in nonviolent civil </v>

802
00:42:03.931 --> 00:42:04.741
<v Speaker 2>disobedience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

803
00:42:04.741 --> 00:42:08.010
<v Speaker 2>if you look at everyone throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>history who actually change society,</v>

804
00:42:08.011 --> 00:42:10.680
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Gandhi or Martin Luther King,</v>

805
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:11.723
<v Speaker 2>who now the progressives are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disavow because he wasn't inclusive of </v>

806
00:42:14.821 --> 00:42:15.654
<v Speaker 2>transgender people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't need the results of </v>

807
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:21.090
<v Speaker 2>violence because that causes powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

808
00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:23.880
<v Speaker 2>When people become a threat to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment.</v>

809
00:42:23.881 --> 00:42:27.420
<v Speaker 2>When the united black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when are unite white people,</v>

810
00:42:27.421 --> 00:42:30.210
<v Speaker 2>when they unite people from different </v>
<v Speaker 2>political persuasions,</v>

811
00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.373
<v Speaker 2>they don't become a threat when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>results of violence because they can be </v>

812
00:42:34.081 --> 00:42:37.860
<v Speaker 2>easily demonized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with by the state.</v>

813
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.590
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a terrible idea.</v>

814
00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be unsuccessful.</v>

815
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also directly linked into why </v>

816
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.900
<v Speaker 1>these regressives and now we can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the regressives.</v>

817
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Somehow we did 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We barely said the word progressive,</v>

818
00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they label everyone you me,</v>

819
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody else as bigots and racists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else because they are,</v>

820
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.023
<v Speaker 1>they can't control people without </v>
<v Speaker 1>splitting us all down into the little </v>

821
00:43:02.661 --> 00:43:03.494
<v Speaker 1>racial markers or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one's oppressed more than the know </v>

822
00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as somebody keeps saying the,</v>

823
00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oppression Olympics basically.</v>

824
00:43:10.191 --> 00:43:11.024
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about the regressives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was your wake up to them at the exact </v>

825
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 1>same time as you sort of woke up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior stuff?</v>

826
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:20.803
<v Speaker 1>Or did it come a little bit after that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you really saw that there was this </v>

827
00:43:23.481 --> 00:43:24.314
<v Speaker 1>group of people that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was protecting and pushing this </v>

828
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:28.874
<v Speaker 1>ideology?</v>

829
00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:31.043
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably correlates with the rise of </v>

830
00:43:33.081 --> 00:43:33.914
<v Speaker 2>Isis with these terrorist attacks in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe with the migrant crisis and the </v>

831
00:43:38.611 --> 00:43:42.600
<v Speaker 2>fight that we're importing people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad cultures and I mean that's the heart</v>

832
00:43:42.601 --> 00:43:43.434
<v Speaker 2>of regressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You itself proclaimed liberals who </v>

833
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.273
<v Speaker 2>defend and tolerate non liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies and I think because at their </v>

834
00:43:52.531 --> 00:43:54.450
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their cultural relativist,</v>

835
00:43:54.451 --> 00:43:55.284
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe that all cultures are </v>

836
00:43:57.271 --> 00:43:58.290
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

837
00:43:58.291 --> 00:43:59.124
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are bad cultures and good </v>

838
00:44:01.291 --> 00:44:03.390
<v Speaker 2>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a video a few days ago.</v>

839
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:04.403
<v Speaker 2>Some cultures are better than others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the heart of progressivism is </v>

840
00:44:08.671 --> 00:44:09.504
<v Speaker 2>this idea of utopianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there can't be such a thing as a bad </v>

841
00:44:13.771 --> 00:44:17.970
<v Speaker 2>culture accepting the fact that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are bad cultures,</v>

842
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.130
<v Speaker 2>demolishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>utopianism,</v>

843
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.323
<v Speaker 2>so that's why progressive so cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive's column entertain the fact </v>

844
00:44:24.781 --> 00:44:27.030
<v Speaker 2>that there are bad cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even for a second,</v>

845
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.520
<v Speaker 2>even though that blatantly off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

846
00:44:29.521 --> 00:44:30.354
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when US troops blew the whistle on how </v>

847
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:33.744
<v Speaker 2>Afghan police officers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're bringing young boys onto the army </v>

848
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:37.704
<v Speaker 2>base and raping them and they were told </v>
<v Speaker 2>to shut up about it because that was </v>

849
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 2>part of their culture.</v>

850
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.113
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a bad culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when UNICEF has to do pr </v>

851
00:44:48.871 --> 00:44:53.130
<v Speaker 2>campaigns to educate 600 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indians,</v>

852
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:53.964
<v Speaker 2>half of their population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to deprecate in the street because </v>

853
00:44:57.601 --> 00:45:00.930
<v Speaker 2>it's causing deadly infections and child</v>
<v Speaker 2>malnutrition.</v>

854
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:05.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to call out bad cultures because</v>

855
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:06.324
<v Speaker 2>I don't think importing them into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>West is compatible with western ideals </v>

856
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.091
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

857
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:16.020
<v Speaker 2>liberal tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the regressives can't entertain that</v>

858
00:45:16.021 --> 00:45:16.854
<v Speaker 2>for a second because their cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>relativists they can't entertain the </v>

859
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:24.540
<v Speaker 2>notion that some cultures are better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than others,</v>

860
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:25.643
<v Speaker 2>which is why in Germany for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these migrants that came in and started </v>

861
00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.470
<v Speaker 2>deprecating and hot tubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started masturbating in swimming pools,</v>

862
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 2>started raping children in swimming </v>
<v Speaker 2>pools.</v>

863
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.520
<v Speaker 2>One of the swimming pools in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>responded by banning male migrants.</v>

864
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 2>How did the regressive left respond to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

865
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 2>They complain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said it was racist.</v>

866
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:49.703
<v Speaker 2>They intimidated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They forced the swimming pool into </v>

867
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:52.494
<v Speaker 2>lifting the ban because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't entertain the notion that </v>

868
00:45:56.461 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 2>some cultures are worse than others and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the heart of regressives.</v>

869
00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:05.730
<v Speaker 2>It's this utopian idea that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same and everybody's equal.</v>

870
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:06.803
<v Speaker 2>Even though this is bad behavior that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be accepting and embracing in </v>

871
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:11.250
<v Speaker 2>the west.</v>

872
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's really no end to it.</v>

873
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:13.974
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why this snake will eventually </v>

874
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.510
<v Speaker 1>eat its tail because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

875
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.950
<v Speaker 1>if you look what happened in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

876
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right on New Year's with,</v>

877
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:24.780
<v Speaker 1>with all the rapes and all the sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks on women,</v>

878
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 1>suddenly all the regressives we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending basically the perpetrators,</v>

879
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:32.490
<v Speaker 1>they kept saying not all Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>

880
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.353
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was saying all Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were saying the specific people </v>

881
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:39.930
<v Speaker 1>here who did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these set of values.</v>

882
00:46:39.931 --> 00:46:42.540
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones that did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a rational person would say.</v>

883
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.553
<v Speaker 1>We didn't say this is condemning every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single person that believes in this and </v>

884
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:51.090
<v Speaker 1>yet they go to defend that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they throw women under the bus.</v>

885
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.073
<v Speaker 1>So it's like they have their pecking </v>
<v Speaker 1>order and in this case women came below </v>

886
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the migrants because the migrants are </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly Muslim.</v>

887
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole oppression,</v>

888
00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Olympics idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it came out in Cologne,</v>

889
00:47:04.901 --> 00:47:05.734
<v Speaker 2>it later emerged that most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetrators were not newly arrived </v>

890
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:09.894
<v Speaker 2>refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were migrants who had been there </v>

891
00:47:11.761 --> 00:47:13.830
<v Speaker 2>for several years and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive.</v>

892
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Celebrates.</v>

893
00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

894
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:22.440
<v Speaker 2>How dare you demonize the refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was done by migrants.</v>

895
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:23.603
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So migrants who were supposedly </v>

896
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:25.503
<v Speaker 2>assimilated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been there for years and yet </v>

897
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:28.583
<v Speaker 2>this is the kind of behavior they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in and that's something to </v>

898
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 2>celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

899
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:35.100
<v Speaker 2>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shines light on the heart,</v>

900
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 2>progressivism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as he said,</v>

901
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after every single terror attack,</v>

902
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.850
<v Speaker 2>we hear the same thing again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't blame Islam.</v>

903
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Not all Muslims are terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever suggested that.</v>

904
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.453
<v Speaker 2>That's never been part of the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try and frame the debate so it </v>

905
00:47:52.061 --> 00:47:56.170
<v Speaker 2>becomes that because they can't win when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually drill down,</v>

906
00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the statistics and show that this </v>

907
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.543
<v Speaker 2>isn't a tiny minority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I bang on about again and </v>

908
00:48:04.541 --> 00:48:05.111
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

909
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I make videos saying Islam is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion of peace.</v>

910
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Get death threats as a result of it.</v>

911
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I guess to prove that it isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion of peace,</v>

912
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you can look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics.</v>

913
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:19.930
<v Speaker 2>This is not a tiny minority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a problem within Islam.</v>

914
00:48:19.931 --> 00:48:24.190
<v Speaker 2>This is why we need to support the </v>
<v Speaker 2>voices of reform within Islam.</v>

915
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 2>So Pew had a poll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

916
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:27.813
<v Speaker 2>the percentage of Muslims who think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide bombings are justified under </v>

917
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:32.374
<v Speaker 2>some circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked Muslims in European </v>

918
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:36.490
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in France,</v>

919
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.270
<v Speaker 2>31 percent of adult Muslims over the age</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 30.</v>

920
00:48:41.271 --> 00:48:43.900
<v Speaker 2>You think that suicide bombings or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes justify,</v>

921
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.110
<v Speaker 2>if you look at young people aged 18 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>29,</v>

922
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:52.350
<v Speaker 2>that goes up to 42 percent think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide bombings or sometimes justify,</v>

923
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:56.470
<v Speaker 2>and it's similar in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 percent of adults think the same.</v>

924
00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.693
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 percent and 22 percent of those aged </v>

925
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 2>18 to 29 think that suicide bombings or </v>
<v Speaker 2>justify.</v>

926
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 2>You've also got huge numbers of Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout your trip.</v>

927
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:10.483
<v Speaker 2>In France for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>27 percent of Muslims aged 18 to 24 </v>

928
00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:17.350
<v Speaker 2>support isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

929
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 2>this is not a tiny fringe minority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

930
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Twenty one percent of Syrian support </v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis.</v>

931
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 2>These are the people who were bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

932
00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:30.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's this lie that the Islamophobia </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry upholds the.</v>

933
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.180
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:49:31.181 --> 00:49:33.580
<v Speaker 2>a tiny fringe minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>

935
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.070
<v Speaker 2>And the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stats prove that.</v>

936
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of the Word </v>

937
00:49:37.911 --> 00:49:38.744
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume you're not a fan of the word </v>

938
00:49:40.221 --> 00:49:40.881
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>

939
00:49:40.881 --> 00:49:43.610
<v Speaker 1>It's an imaginary world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't fear a set of ideas.</v>

940
00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.100
<v Speaker 1>You can fear actions that people might </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

941
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.113
<v Speaker 1>and Islam itself says a lot of bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about infidel is like a the two </v>

942
00:49:50.811 --> 00:49:51.644
<v Speaker 1>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

943
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:55.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's not an irrational fear to fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>this set of ideas.</v>

944
00:49:55.371 --> 00:49:56.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just a made up word,</v>

945
00:49:56.751 --> 00:49:57.584
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't discount that there might </v>

946
00:49:58.401 --> 00:50:03.401
<v Speaker 1>be bigotry towards Muslim people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the word itself is a slippery slope.</v>

947
00:50:03.621 --> 00:50:04.454
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

948
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's become interchangeable with racist,</v>

949
00:50:07.861 --> 00:50:08.820
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

950
00:50:08.821 --> 00:50:09.654
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Islamophobia industry is bolstered </v>

951
00:50:12.961 --> 00:50:14.970
<v Speaker 2>and exaggerate it to such an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

952
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.193
<v Speaker 2>there are Islamophobic attacks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're horrible and we shouldn't cry </v>

953
00:50:18.541 --> 00:50:20.580
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's presented.</v>

954
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Those are anti Muslim attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

955
00:50:22.551 --> 00:50:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not Islamophobic attacks.</v>

956
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.813
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not afraid of the idea of </v>

957
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:29.600
<v Speaker 1>something they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid of the people.</v>

958
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:30.643
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

959
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

960
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:32.563
<v Speaker 2>That was a basically racist attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at actual hate crimes </v>

961
00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:38.970
<v Speaker 2>that far outweighed by antisemitic </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks,</v>

962
00:50:38.971 --> 00:50:41.640
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in most western countries.</v>

963
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:42.683
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw that again in molenbeek just the </v>

964
00:50:45.811 --> 00:50:50.811
<v Speaker 2>other day where the media reported that </v>
<v Speaker 2>a right wing protests had run over.</v>

965
00:50:50.941 --> 00:50:55.941
<v Speaker 2>A Muslim woman later turned out that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a Muslim teen from molenbeek who ran</v>

966
00:50:56.431 --> 00:50:59.250
<v Speaker 2>over the Muslim woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are these,</v>

967
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.113
<v Speaker 2>these fake Islamophobic attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was another one on Wall Street where </v>

968
00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.820
<v Speaker 2>a Muslim woman says she was slashed </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the face.</v>

969
00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Then Islamophobic attacks turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was completely made of.</v>

970
00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:12.300
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know this point,</v>

971
00:51:12.301 --> 00:51:14.370
<v Speaker 2>why not own it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not say yes?</v>

972
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of an ideology that supports </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharia law,</v>

973
00:51:17.911 --> 00:51:22.740
<v Speaker 2>that supports stoning women to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>executing homosexuals killing people who</v>

974
00:51:22.741 --> 00:51:24.780
<v Speaker 2>leave the faith of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

975
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm very afraid of importing those kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ideas into the west and when,</v>

976
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.253
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of Muslims of American </v>

977
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Muslims support the right to live under </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharia law in the United States.</v>

978
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.313
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to call attention to that </v>

979
00:51:42.511 --> 00:51:45.030
<v Speaker 2>figure because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way too high.</v>

980
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.210
<v Speaker 2>And to call attention to that figure is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to be Islamophobic,</v>

981
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:49.343
<v Speaker 2>it's to be rightly concerned about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>intolerant beliefs being imported into </v>

982
00:51:53.671 --> 00:51:56.280
<v Speaker 2>the west as they now are in such great </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>

983
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:57.263
<v Speaker 1>So for people like us that want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest discussions about this without </v>

984
00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:02.184
<v Speaker 1>bigotry and without hyperbole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know it's very hard to do and we </v>

985
00:52:05.251 --> 00:52:07.500
<v Speaker 1>don't win any points for doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

986
00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.380
<v Speaker 1>but for people like us and I know it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing movement,</v>

987
00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:16.020
<v Speaker 1>should we start thinking of Islam more </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a political ideology than a religion?</v>

988
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:16.883
<v Speaker 1>Because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how many times we separate </v>

989
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.510
<v Speaker 1>ideas versus people religion first </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

990
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.580
<v Speaker 1>people can't seem to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just.</v>

991
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:27.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot detangle these two things.</v>

992
00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.553
<v Speaker 1>But I'm starting to think that if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>start describing these actions as </v>

993
00:52:32.371 --> 00:52:34.260
<v Speaker 1>political actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing gays,</v>

994
00:52:34.261 --> 00:52:35.930
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

995
00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.000
<v Speaker 1>A oppressing women not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If these were political,</v>

996
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.370
<v Speaker 1>a political party was pushing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

997
00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:45.230
<v Speaker 1>the left would be completely against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that sort of how we have to.</v>

998
00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Not to give up our tactics publicly </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

999
00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:50.340
<v Speaker 1>but is that how we have to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on this argument?</v>

1000
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:53.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1001
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris Majeed was dave outline the </v>

1002
00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:59.060
<v Speaker 2>fact that this is not just jihad is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1003
00:52:59.061 --> 00:53:00.620
<v Speaker 2>isn't just jihadist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1004
00:53:00.621 --> 00:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>you can point to that and say that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny minority,</v>

1005
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.130
<v Speaker 2>but the main problem is Islam is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
00:53:07.131 --> 00:53:12.131
<v Speaker 2>I agreed with Obama when he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism is not an existential threat.</v>

1007
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:13.603
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're not going to all be killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by terrorists is not going to be such a </v>

1008
00:53:16.371 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1009
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:20.960
<v Speaker 2>onset of terrorist attacks that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>proves an existential threat.</v>

1010
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:25.040
<v Speaker 2>But when you import these ideas that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>incompatible with western,</v>

1011
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 2>then that's a direct why quality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1012
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.483
<v Speaker 2>our culture and the entire underpinnings</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Western society as a free liberal </v>

1013
00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:38.460
<v Speaker 2>tolerant society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to emphasize that distinction</v>

1014
00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 2>that there are not just jihadist Islam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Miss.</v>

1015
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at deadline there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>molenbeek and Brussels.</v>

1016
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:46.943
<v Speaker 2>He was protected for months after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paris massacre by his friends and </v>

1017
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:53.130
<v Speaker 2>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1018
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:53.964
<v Speaker 2>Then not jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't gone out and slaughtered </v>

1019
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:56.904
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were protecting a jihadist </v>

1020
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:00.263
<v Speaker 2>because there is limits and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the problem when we get huge </v>

1021
00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:07.230
<v Speaker 2>numbers of people moving into Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>

1022
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.273
<v Speaker 2>they create these ghettos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they create centers of power and then </v>

1023
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:14.610
<v Speaker 2>isis comes out and its manifesto and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1024
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:15.893
<v Speaker 2>we're going to encourage the creation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ghettos in the west to radicalize </v>

1025
00:54:19.121 --> 00:54:23.370
<v Speaker 2>these populations to support our cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's a problem.</v>

1026
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:24.443
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get an AK 47 on the streets and </v>

1027
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Malombe within a few hours for 400 </v>
<v Speaker 2>euros.</v>

1028
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:30.803
<v Speaker 2>That's doesn't just arise out jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this whole is support network </v>

1029
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.713
<v Speaker 2>that protects Solo Abdeslam for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the distinction we need to </v>

1030
00:54:41.101 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 2>emphasize to leftists and regressives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1031
00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:45.654
<v Speaker 2>it's not a tiny minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to include Islamis as part of </v>

1032
00:54:48.721 --> 00:54:51.780
<v Speaker 2>the problem and if you include them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem,</v>

1033
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:56.960
<v Speaker 2>the figures show that it's a distressing</v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion of people who support,</v>

1034
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:59.960
<v Speaker 2>advocate and promote these intolerant </v>
<v Speaker 2>believers.</v>

1035
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know no matter how many times we </v>

1036
00:55:02.231 --> 00:55:03.064
<v Speaker 1>repeat the difference between jihadists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Islamists and the average nominal </v>

1037
00:55:06.461 --> 00:55:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Muslim somehow that just can't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through to a certain amount of people.</v>

1038
00:55:09.851 --> 00:55:10.684
<v Speaker 1>But before I let you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to dive into the immigration </v>

1039
00:55:12.401 --> 00:55:13.234
<v Speaker 1>thing a little deeper because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done a lot on it and when I've watched </v>

1040
00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:16.950
<v Speaker 1>some of your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1041
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.823
<v Speaker 1>we really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mainstream media in the United </v>

1042
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.040
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we barely talk about it.</v>

1043
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I would guess that if you watch CNN 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours today,</v>

1044
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:27.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wouldn't see one story on it,</v>

1045
00:55:27.281 --> 00:55:29.390
<v Speaker 1>literally not one minute on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1046
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:33.160
<v Speaker 1>and then I watch your videos and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and I will watch some stuff</v>

1047
00:55:33.161 --> 00:55:33.994
<v Speaker 1>on the BBC or something like that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a sense that it's a big problem and </v>

1048
00:55:36.281 --> 00:55:37.114
<v Speaker 1>I get tons of messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mainly I'm getting a ton of stuff from </v>

1049
00:55:39.041 --> 00:55:44.041
<v Speaker 1>Sweden especially talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say out of a 10 where,</v>

1050
00:55:44.231 --> 00:55:45.880
<v Speaker 1>where is this thing hat right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1051
00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:49.240
<v Speaker 1>is this really as bad as the videos that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put out?</v>

1052
00:55:49.241 --> 00:55:51.850
<v Speaker 1>It makes it sound like there's a massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis right now,</v>

1053
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:55.690
<v Speaker 1>or is some of it overblown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it different for every country?</v>

1054
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm still struggling to get a hold on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1055
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different for every country.</v>

1056
00:56:00.911 --> 00:56:04.690
<v Speaker 2>That tends to be a tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a country goes above,</v>

1057
00:56:04.691 --> 00:56:08.080
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six to seven percent Muslim population,</v>

1058
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.333
<v Speaker 2>that's when you get the no go areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the media still claims is a </v>

1059
00:56:13.121 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got chased out of one in molenbeek.</v>

1060
00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I can attest to the fact that it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the kind of tipping point.</v>

1061
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:21.083
<v Speaker 2>I mean to illustrate this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the prison in these </v>

1062
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 2>different European countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1063
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:27.694
<v Speaker 2>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course just stuff that the </v>

1064
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:29.314
<v Speaker 2>Brussels attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim population is around six </v>

1065
00:56:31.841 --> 00:56:32.674
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the prison population of Belgium </v>

1066
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:35.973
<v Speaker 2>comprises 45 percent Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 45 percent of the prisoners in </v>

1067
00:56:40.991 --> 00:56:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Muslims,</v>

1068
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact they only make up six </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the population.</v>

1069
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:49.540
<v Speaker 2>You look at friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six to 10 percent Muslim population,</v>

1070
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.800
<v Speaker 2>but the prison population is 70 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims.</v>

1071
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Same in Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim population,</v>

1072
00:56:56.531 --> 00:57:01.060
<v Speaker 2>three point seven percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prison population is 70 percent Muslim,</v>

1073
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.480
<v Speaker 2>so obviously something is broken here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were getting the correct word,</v>

1074
00:57:06.831 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Speaker 2>seeing the creation of more of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ghettos,</v>

1075
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:10.323
<v Speaker 2>they don't assimilate for our political </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders want to bring them in for their </v>

1076
00:57:14.141 --> 00:57:14.974
<v Speaker 2>own agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the goal of imposing huge </v>

1077
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:22.690
<v Speaker 2>numbers of people from the third world </v>
<v Speaker 2>to vote for bigger government.</v>

1078
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.420
<v Speaker 2>If you look at polls conducted amongst </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>

1079
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:26.643
<v Speaker 2>they typically support expanded welfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and they vote once they become </v>

1080
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 2>citizens for bigger government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've placed Europe security.</v>

1081
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:40.620
<v Speaker 2>They placed our entire social cohesion </v>
<v Speaker 2>under grave danger in favor of.</v>

1082
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Of advancing this political agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it was that in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Angola Merkel,</v>

1084
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.080
<v Speaker 1>do you think it was that calculated like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1085
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:48.923
<v Speaker 1>my sense is that there was some level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt because of the Holocaust and </v>

1086
00:57:52.081 --> 00:57:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Germany's stills trying to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1087
00:57:53.791 --> 00:57:56.850
<v Speaker 1>that they partly we're trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something good here.</v>

1088
00:57:56.851 --> 00:57:57.684
<v Speaker 1>They brought this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one point two or one point </v>

1089
00:57:59.011 --> 00:57:59.844
<v Speaker 1>3 million people in and that it is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing the system and creating all </v>

1090
00:58:04.111 --> 00:58:08.880
<v Speaker 1>this resentment and a country that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a tough history with xenophobia.</v>

1091
00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It's only gonna get worse and it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe,</v>

1092
00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.193
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she knowingly did this even if it </v>

1093
00:58:15.811 --> 00:58:19.140
<v Speaker 1>was just to get votes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's not working right,</v>

1094
00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:19.974
<v Speaker 1>because it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the right parties just win </v>

1095
00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:22.663
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>

1096
00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:24.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1097
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:25.760
<v Speaker 2>It was a reaction to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1098
00:58:25.761 --> 00:58:26.594
<v Speaker 2>for the past couple of years you've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a basically a conservative backlash </v>

1099
00:58:29.301 --> 00:58:30.240
<v Speaker 2>sweeping Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1100
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:35.620
<v Speaker 2>your elections in 2014 proof of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a backlash to that.</v>

1101
00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500,000</v>

1102
00:58:39.171 --> 00:58:43.790
<v Speaker 2>migrants who have come into Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't registered with all authorities,</v>

1103
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:45.890
<v Speaker 2>so that's going to become a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1104
00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.053
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it was virtue signaling on </v>

1105
00:58:48.621 --> 00:58:49.431
<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1106
00:58:49.431 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 2>So you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:52.940
<v Speaker 2>the German Green Party politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephanie,</v>

1108
00:58:52.941 --> 00:58:53.774
<v Speaker 2>Yvonne Berg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got up in front of the German </v>

1109
00:58:55.701 --> 00:58:57.600
<v Speaker 2>parliament and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1110
00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:01.130
<v Speaker 2>ass city will change radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hold it in 20,</v>

1111
00:59:01.131 --> 00:59:04.070
<v Speaker 2>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will no longer be a German majority</v>

1112
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.113
<v Speaker 2>in our city and that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she said that simply as a way of </v>

1113
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.863
<v Speaker 2>pissing off the right wing in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would bring in these migrants to </v>

1114
00:59:15.711 --> 00:59:19.720
<v Speaker 2>displace the German population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

1115
00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 2>part of it is virtue on steroids.</v>

1116
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is that guilt about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis,</v>

1117
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:26.174
<v Speaker 2>which of course we have to remember only</v>
<v Speaker 2>a minority of the German population </v>

1118
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.290
<v Speaker 2>actually supported the Nazi party in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 thirties.</v>

1119
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:35.960
<v Speaker 2>So I would argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you punish,</v>

1120
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>German citizens,</v>

1121
00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:37.994
<v Speaker 2>taxpayers now we've got Germans being </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked out of social housing to be </v>

1122
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:42.674
<v Speaker 2>replaced by migrants over one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2 million migrants brought in already </v>

1123
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:48.590
<v Speaker 2>over the past year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1124
00:59:48.591 --> 00:59:51.540
<v Speaker 2>politicians celebrating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demographics,</v>

1125
00:59:51.541 --> 00:59:52.374
<v Speaker 2>suicide of their country and it clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't working because every single day </v>

1126
00:59:57.170 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 2>we have these cases of people being </v>
<v Speaker 2>raped now,</v>

1127
01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:04.690
<v Speaker 2>the primary victims of rape of Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>women and girls in these moment,</v>

1128
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.790
<v Speaker 2>migrant camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now you see these reports of,</v>

1129
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>African migrants raping boys in swimming</v>

1130
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 2>pools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And quite frankly,</v>

1131
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of seeing it every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a bad culture.</v>

1132
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:18.403
<v Speaker 2>These people aren't being assimilated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you import huge numbers of people at </v>

1133
01:00:22.761 --> 01:00:26.570
<v Speaker 2>break neck speed with no clear plan on </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to assimilate them,</v>

1134
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.560
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be bedlam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be chaos and that's now</v>

1135
01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.403
<v Speaker 2>why top military chiefs in Sweden and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland in Norway or warning that </v>

1136
01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:39.590
<v Speaker 2>this could lead to civil unrest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an outright war.</v>

1137
01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Basically if it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it continues this way.</v>

1138
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to end with you on a positive </v>

1139
01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we figure out how to do that?</v>

1140
01:00:46.521 --> 01:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Europe going to be in 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any hope?</v>

1141
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.151
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

1142
01:00:51.151 --> 01:00:51.984
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of these parties are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>voted out of power and that's been </v>

1143
01:00:55.531 --> 01:00:56.364
<v Speaker 2>happening for the past couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is a kind of backlash against </v>

1144
01:00:59.821 --> 01:01:00.720
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1145
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for limited skilled immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's healthy for a </v>

1146
01:01:05.551 --> 01:01:07.740
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way it's going,</v>

1147
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:09.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300,000</v>

1148
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.020
<v Speaker 2>immigrants every year coming into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United Kingdom.</v>

1149
01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:16.710
<v Speaker 2>We've only got a population of $60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million and that's after the.</v>

1150
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the number after the other ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>have left.</v>

1151
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's going to become overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cause more problems,</v>

1152
01:01:22.861 --> 01:01:25.950
<v Speaker 2>more riots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from a positive perspective,</v>

1153
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.133
<v Speaker 2>you know my videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your videos about this or reaching a </v>

1154
01:01:29.731 --> 01:01:33.810
<v Speaker 2>huge audience because the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually lies about it.</v>

1155
01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:37.920
<v Speaker 2>They don't point out that 72 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people coming in and man,</v>

1156
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:42.930
<v Speaker 2>these are generally not families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four fifths of them at one point weren't</v>

1157
01:01:42.931 --> 01:01:46.260
<v Speaker 2>even Syrians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that I can do a video about</v>

1158
01:01:46.261 --> 01:01:47.094
<v Speaker 2>this and it gets over a million views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proves that people are thirsty for the </v>

1159
01:01:50.671 --> 01:01:51.504
<v Speaker 2>truth and we are shaping the narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually the hope is that that </v>

1160
01:01:56.131 --> 01:01:59.940
<v Speaker 2>will change government policy by sheer </v>
<v Speaker 2>force of pressure.</v>

1161
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>

1162
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:05.540
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly why I try to have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations and that's why I liked the</v>

1163
01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:06.374
<v Speaker 1>work you do and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what we'll do for anyone that's </v>

1164
01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:09.434
<v Speaker 1>watching this that thinks that anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Paul said was conspiratorial or </v>

1165
01:02:13.401 --> 01:02:14.234
<v Speaker 1>unfactual,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Will you make that commitment?</v>

1167
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk some this stuff out with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of the people.</v>

1168
