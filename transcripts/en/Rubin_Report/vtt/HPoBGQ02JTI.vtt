1
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure you all know that I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small government guy.</v>

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>What's small government means to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least economically is that you should</v>

3
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:12.784
<v Speaker 1>keep most of what you earn and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself are the best arbiter to decide </v>

4
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.793
<v Speaker 1>where your money goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the money you are and goes to </v>

5
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:20.854
<v Speaker 1>fixing your house or buying a new car or</v>
<v Speaker 1>to funding planned parenthood and </v>

6
00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:27.220
<v Speaker 1>supporting Lincoln Center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that should be up to you.</v>

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>You've worked hard for your money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume,</v>

8
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that you're a better judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how to spend it rather than giving it</v>

9
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:33.814
<v Speaker 1>to a wasteful government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will often spend it on programs </v>

10
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>that you don't even care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>being for small government isn't only </v>
<v Speaker 1>about taxes and economics at its root.</v>

12
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Being for small government is also about</v>
<v Speaker 1>being for the individual.</v>

13
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.653
<v Speaker 1>I believe that your faculty to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how you want to live is far </v>

14
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>better than anyone else's faculty on how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should live your life.</v>

15
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the need for the government</v>

16
00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>is different depending on whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in a rural area or an urban center.</v>

17
00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:07.690
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a rural area with less people,</v>

18
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:08.524
<v Speaker 1>there is most likely less of a need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation than there is in an urban </v>

19
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:12.664
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take something as simple as a noise </v>

20
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>ordinance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live in a remote,</v>

21
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:17.164
<v Speaker 1>rural area in the middle of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is most likely no need for a law </v>

22
00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:21.154
<v Speaker 1>to stop people from doing construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the night or blasting </v>

23
00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>their music too loudly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you live in an urban center,</v>

24
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Say New York City where people live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>small apartments on top of one another.</v>

25
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>A noise ordinance might be important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

26
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.383
<v Speaker 1>You can't have construction people </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking down walls at all hours of the </v>

27
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 1>night and you might not want your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor blasting music at 3:00</v>

28
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>

29
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.403
<v Speaker 1>The next piece of the limited government</v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzle is whether or not the government </v>

30
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>needs to be involved in so many facets </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our lives at all.</v>

31
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.733
<v Speaker 1>Even in the case of New York City with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cramped conditions and tiny living </v>

32
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:51.094
<v Speaker 1>spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the government who has to tell </v>

33
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:53.404
<v Speaker 1>companies not to do construction in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night or tenants not to </v>

34
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:57.034
<v Speaker 1>blast music at ungodly hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where an interesting discussion </v>

35
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:01.174
<v Speaker 1>can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the job of the government as laid </v>

36
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>out by the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think we're still governed by to</v>

37
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:07.264
<v Speaker 1>regulate these interpersonal issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it the job of individuals to deal </v>

38
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:12.604
<v Speaker 1>with these issues themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should a building in New York City have </v>

39
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:17.950
<v Speaker 1>a policy about noise instead of leaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to the government?</v>

40
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.113
<v Speaker 1>Should it be incumbent on you to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your neighbor about the volume of their </v>

41
00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>music rather than leaving it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government?</v>

42
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.323
<v Speaker 1>Can issues we think of traditionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>being dealt with by the government </v>

43
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:29.044
<v Speaker 1>actually be dealt with in the private </v>
<v Speaker 1>sector or is the government already too </v>

44
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.910
<v Speaker 1>deep into controlling us that we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>never scale it back without burning down</v>

45
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:37.744
<v Speaker 1>the system?</v>

46
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.990
<v Speaker 1>While noise ordinances aren't the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressing issue out there?</v>

47
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.853
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I use it as a simple example </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the battle between the private and </v>

48
00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:46.054
<v Speaker 1>the public and how sometimes we assign </v>
<v Speaker 1>power to the government when perhaps </v>

49
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.003
<v Speaker 1>there could be a better option based in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our own capacity to reason for </v>

50
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With all this in mind,</v>

51
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:56.884
<v Speaker 1>we're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn liberty this week and me is best </v>

52
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>selling author and economist at George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mason University,</v>

53
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Bryan Caplan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian is in a narco capitalists,</v>

54
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.054
<v Speaker 1>which in simple terms is an extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian who wants government pretty </v>

55
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>much out of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about taxes,</v>

56
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rent control,</v>

57
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.363
<v Speaker 1>and much more and see if there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>places that the private sector can </v>

58
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>actually do a better job than what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public has been able to do.</v>

59
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to us,</v>

60
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>penal code four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two nine.</v>

61
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Pursuant to the laws of the state in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you are governed,</v>

62
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>you are hereby ordered to click like and</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment down below.</v>

63
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.410
<v Speaker 1>We're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn liberty this week,</v>

64
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 1>and joining me today is a professor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics at George Mason University,</v>

65
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>an author and a narco capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End a pacifist Brian Kaplan.</v>

66
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks a lot for having me.</v>

67
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Lot of good buzzwords in there and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get to all of them,</v>

68
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.533
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it like being a professor on </v>

69
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.740
<v Speaker 1>campus these days that doesn't identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a progressive?</v>

70
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.963
<v Speaker 1>Is that tough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting rocks thrown at you </v>

71
00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:07.100
<v Speaker 1>every day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that gone?</v>

72
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 2>My life is perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's ever had.</v>

73
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Nothing bad's ever happened to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

74
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten a negative comment on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a student evaluation.</v>

75
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.213
<v Speaker 2>To be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the Economics Department at </v>

76
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 2>George Mason University,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very unusual place.</v>

77
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of libertarian and free </v>
<v Speaker 2>market oriented people there,</v>

78
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.263
<v Speaker 2>but also what I say is that the stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you hear on the media while </v>

79
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:31.054
<v Speaker 2>generally true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you remember how many people are on </v>

80
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 2>campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many professors there are,</v>

81
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:35.404
<v Speaker 2>so if every week you see some horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing happens to one professor that </v>

82
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 2>still leaves the 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

83
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.413
<v Speaker 2>nine percent of all professors who had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly find week and so far so good </v>

84
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.460
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

85
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you make a point of saying you're in</v>

86
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:51.780
<v Speaker 1>the economics department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably insulated from some of</v>

87
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:55.800
<v Speaker 1>this stuff's because you have to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>with facts and figures and numbers.</v>

88
00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:59.400
<v Speaker 1>These are sort of outside of the realm </v>
<v Speaker 1>of where social justice can hit.</v>

89
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

90
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.853
<v Speaker 2>So just know economics says a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of field where you can say </v>

91
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:04.214
<v Speaker 2>really controversial and shocking things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are curious and want to talk </v>

92
00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:10.250
<v Speaker 2>about it in a civilized way rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>get really mad at you.</v>

93
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:11.084
<v Speaker 2>So I'd say at least half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial ideas in academia have </v>

94
00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:20.270
<v Speaker 2>come out of economics and economists get</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobel prizes for these ideas.</v>

95
00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.463
<v Speaker 2>Gary Becker and Milton Friedman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like people are waiting around </v>

97
00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:26.600
<v Speaker 2>for you to say the wrong thing and jump </v>
<v Speaker 2>on you,</v>

98
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.903
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said to me then you have the real </v>

99
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.580
<v Speaker 2>difference is just people who are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>dull.</v>

100
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.110
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economists were very boring,</v>

101
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like they're angry at </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for doing other stuff.</v>

102
00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:38.210
<v Speaker 2>They're just not doing really exciting </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

103
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.463
<v Speaker 2>But there's plenty of room in economics </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to say almost anything </v>

104
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:43.940
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only get away with it,</v>

105
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.160
<v Speaker 2>but to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning I mean,</v>

106
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've long been telling people like,</v>

107
00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:48.494
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to be a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to figure out how to repackage </v>

108
00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:54.080
<v Speaker 2>what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want to do with economics,</v>

109
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 2>and then just get a Phd Phd economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll make more money,</v>

110
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 2>you'll get tenure or you'll get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>email,</v>

111
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 2>you'll get a job easily and you'll be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very supportive atmosphere.</v>

112
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>We can say you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you truly believe in the free</v>

113
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>market because you're welcoming people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take your job right now.</v>

114
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty good.</v>

115
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Ten years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not that worried in that way.</v>

116
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:14.564
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also remember that the more people </v>

117
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>in order for in order to become a vestry</v>
<v Speaker 2>first have to become one of my customers</v>

118
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:20.774
<v Speaker 2>and go to Grad school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So naturally it's not as on self </v>

119
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 2>interest might seem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

120
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that professors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics,</v>

121
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 2>either George Mason or you were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioning a debate,</v>

122
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:30.614
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it in a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that generally professors of economics </v>

123
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.070
<v Speaker 2>from whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

124
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever pathology they believe in,</v>

125
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are able to debate and it doesn't get </v>

126
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 2>personal and it can really stick on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues and that kind of thing.</v>

127
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

128
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 2>in general I'd say yes.</v>

129
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.083
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main problem is just people who are </v>

130
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 2>not interested in bigger ideas and only </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to focus on their research topics.</v>

131
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 2>So people like that are not touchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not hostile,</v>

132
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>they're just apathetic or they use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'll have the idea of,</v>

133
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are doing is not science and I </v>

134
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:03.320
<v Speaker 2>don't really care about that and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't belong here,</v>

135
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that they disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying as they disagree with</v>

136
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>people taking on bigger questions of any</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds.</v>

137
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

138
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:12.884
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of what I've dealt with in </v>

139
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 2>my time in academia is just I want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>big exciting ideas.</v>

140
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.663
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of economists frown on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because they disagree with the </v>

141
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 2>content because they disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

142
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Begging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exciting.</v>

143
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before we get into some of your big </v>

144
00:07:26.401 --> 00:07:27.234
<v Speaker 2>and exciting ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you find that generally outside of </v>

145
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:31.334
<v Speaker 2>the universities that just the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>populace really doesn't understand </v>

146
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 2>anything about economics because this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I see all the time,</v>

147
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only garner so much information </v>

148
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:40.934
<v Speaker 2>from social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I see people saying things about </v>

149
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:43.664
<v Speaker 2>trade all the time and immigration all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and all these things that are </v>

150
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 2>tied back into economics and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really seem to know much about</v>

151
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

152
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a whole book on this called </v>

153
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.230
<v Speaker 2>the myth of the rational voter democracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

154
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.073
<v Speaker 2>bad policies in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go over all the evidence on what </v>

155
00:07:59.061 --> 00:07:59.894
<v Speaker 2>does the public actually believe about </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics compared to what anyone who </v>

156
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 2>can explain the textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

157
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

158
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think about it is so mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now we're in la.</v>

159
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 2>I grew up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I will say that until I was 17,</v>

160
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I never heard any argument against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum wage.</v>

161
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I never heard any argument against </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation of pharmaceuticals.</v>

162
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever heard any argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the welfare state ever.</v>

163
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not growing up in Berkeley or some</v>

164
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 2>some left wing haven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just growing up in a normal,</v>

165
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:33.710
<v Speaker 2>boring middle class suburb here in Los </v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles.</v>

166
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.933
<v Speaker 2>But the kinds of arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 2>economists make and are aware of are </v>

167
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 2>just not even on people's radar.</v>

168
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 2>So that's an important distinction that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just said there that you didn't grow</v>

169
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 2>up in Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles.</v>

170
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 2>That's somewhat blue collar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elliot middle,</v>

171
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 2>middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle class,</v>

172
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:50.534
<v Speaker 2>middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

173
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

174
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.203
<v Speaker 2>it was probably could easily been half </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican in days and still like I'd </v>

175
00:08:57.861 --> 00:08:58.694
<v Speaker 2>never heard any of the very basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic arguments critiquing standard </v>

176
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 2>popular regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Indian.</v>

177
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's like everyone really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 2>talking to my parents about rent control</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

179
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:10.284
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the economist critique of rent control </v>

180
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.284
<v Speaker 2>and how it caused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How it causes a shortage in housing for </v>

181
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:15.661
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

182
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 2>well we own a rental property so we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>against it.</v>

183
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of all that they could come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with.</v>

184
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

185
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.880
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

186
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very,</v>

187
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 2>very standard for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 2>not just the American public but the </v>
<v Speaker 2>global,</v>

189
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:29.214
<v Speaker 2>but the global public and throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>history is just like the very basic </v>

190
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:32.604
<v Speaker 2>ideas of economics that are in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>textbook are not known and when they're </v>

191
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 2>heard this is this regular thing.</v>

192
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.843
<v Speaker 2>So it's one thing to never heard them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but northern normal reaction is just </v>

193
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 2>anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I say,</v>

194
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 2>well they're so insulated from any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea basically.</v>

195
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it just like,</v>

196
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:49.600
<v Speaker 2>it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you saying this while?</v>

197
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.563
<v Speaker 2>Can't we have the minimum wage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a program to go and help poor </v>

198
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:54.084
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then an economist comes along and </v>

199
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 2>says there's a downside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This could cause unemployment.</v>

200
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.600
<v Speaker 2>And people's reaction is how could you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say something like that?</v>

201
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or only what kind of like you hate,</v>

202
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.370
<v Speaker 2>you hate poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

203
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:06.204
<v Speaker 2>this seems like a parody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have experienced this firsthand </v>

204
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.580
<v Speaker 2>plenty of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you do with that?</v>

205
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.793
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you try to lay out something and </v>

206
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:15.061
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

207
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 2>here's data to support it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so emotional to somebody else.</v>

208
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:19.764
<v Speaker 2>Something like minimum wage or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually I try to connect it to versed </v>

209
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 2>and experienced because the only time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about,</v>

210
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.291
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

211
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.180
<v Speaker 2>talking about the data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then someone could say,</v>

212
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your data.</v>

213
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.973
<v Speaker 2>Like how do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There must be plenty of other people </v>

214
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:31.830
<v Speaker 2>have other data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trying to say,</v>

215
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:34.230
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you fill out a job application,</v>

216
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 2>you get to the line on salary </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirements.</v>

217
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:37.990
<v Speaker 2>You put a million dollars an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

218
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

219
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.750
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

220
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I think if I put too much money then I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>less likely to get the job.</v>

221
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.293
<v Speaker 2>Ah Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just me that believes that </v>

222
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 2>if wages are too high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that unemployment result,</v>

223
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 2>you believe it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that you don't want to connect</v>

224
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:54.924
<v Speaker 2>what you know from your own experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the world of policy because it </v>

225
00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:58.790
<v Speaker 2>doesn't sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

226
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting what you said </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your parents.</v>

227
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:01.554
<v Speaker 2>They had a rental property so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like rent control because </v>

228
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:07.150
<v Speaker 2>obviously you don't want it if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the owner of the property and how we,</v>

229
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.033
<v Speaker 2>how we all apply our own life might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate from what our philosophical </v>

230
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:13.090
<v Speaker 2>principles are.</v>

231
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I lived in New York City for </v>

232
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 2>about 12 years in an apartment that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>rent stabilized,</v>

233
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 2>so it's slightly different than right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Controlled,</v>

234
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 2>but they could only increase my rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think something like,</v>

235
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would change every few years,</v>

236
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 2>but about two percent a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which for me as the tenant was great and</v>

237
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:29.670
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 2>over the course of 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my rent when I started at 1650 for a two</v>

239
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 2>bedroom apartment on the upper west and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it maxed out at about 2000.</v>

240
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 2>So as the tenant on my side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty great.</v>

241
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Make the argument why I'm wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

242
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

243
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:46.420
<v Speaker 2>so in terms of your own self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>

244
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.230
<v Speaker 2>might be perfectly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>

245
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there are some downsides.</v>

246
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Things like quality tends to go down </v>
<v Speaker 2>with rent control,</v>

247
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.573
<v Speaker 2>so know like the heating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heating breaks down and you can </v>

248
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.090
<v Speaker 2>never fix a couple things.</v>

249
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there is that,</v>

250
00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.301
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

251
00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:00.011
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just,</v>

252
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:00.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very standard result with any kind of </v>

253
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:02.374
<v Speaker 2>price controls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't adjust on the price then </v>

254
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.730
<v Speaker 2>you can adjust on all these other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these other ways to adjust unquality</v>

255
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 2>a bot or are you going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can try charging people for extras,</v>

256
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

257
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like you know,</v>

258
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.134
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be people who do</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit from the policies and if you </v>

259
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:20.730
<v Speaker 2>happen to be that person then it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>elegant.</v>

260
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.573
<v Speaker 2>Like you might say it hard to know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>saving grace is that in general people </v>

261
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:25.774
<v Speaker 2>are not comfortable arguing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>political policy or policies on self </v>

262
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 2>hearsay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The grounds some,</v>

263
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were saying,</v>

264
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:32.640
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very bad for society.</v>

265
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 2>People normally want to dispute that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is bad for society.</v>

266
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well sure it's bad for society,</v>

267
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 2>but I'm one of them in the minority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are benefiting from this,</v>

268
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 2>so I like it and we should have it.</v>

269
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:43.124
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the point that you make there </v>

271
00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:45.164
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're going to have to cut in </v>

272
00:12:45.741 --> 00:12:47.540
<v Speaker 1>other ways if they can't raise your </v>
<v Speaker 1>rent.</v>

273
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.400
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my building in the winter,</v>

274
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 1>every winter there would literally be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

275
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.953
<v Speaker 1>if we were in the middle of a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be three or four days in a </v>

276
00:12:54.531 --> 00:12:56.810
<v Speaker 1>row where we would not have heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an old steam heat,</v>

277
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.153
<v Speaker 1>four story building and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple days when I was single back then </v>

278
00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:04.730
<v Speaker 1>that I literally was under the covers </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my dog because I didn't want her to</v>

279
00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 1>freeze either and I went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the management building,</v>

280
00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:09.314
<v Speaker 1>which is a couple blocks away and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically reaming them out and I </v>

281
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.303
<v Speaker 1>remember the woman was sitting behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof glass and this is what's </v>

282
00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:18.950
<v Speaker 1>wrong with this system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman,</v>

283
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.903
<v Speaker 1>she works for a big company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they own 500 buildings were stuck under </v>

284
00:13:23.061 --> 00:13:23.894
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never fully connected that to rent </v>

285
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 1>control or rent stabilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not inclined to move out to a full plate</v>

286
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.400
<v Speaker 1>price place that had good heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.690
<v Speaker 1>So that does show how we all sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate these strange things.</v>

288
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.460
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about a narco capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

289
00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:38.294
<v Speaker 1>Because I haven't done much on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've had one in Norco </v>

290
00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:43.250
<v Speaker 1>capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend that guy t on on youtube.</v>

291
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.390
<v Speaker 1>You should check out if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

292
00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Great guy in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

293
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.320
<v Speaker 1>what is a narco capitalism.</v>

294
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 2>So enter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

295
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.953
<v Speaker 2>capitalism is the idea that these so </v>
<v Speaker 2>called minimal functions to the states </v>

296
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:56.730
<v Speaker 2>are actually more than you really need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

297
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 2>it is not only imaginable butts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

298
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.123
<v Speaker 2>it could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really could work to prioritize </v>

299
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:03.684
<v Speaker 2>the last lingering functions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government like police courts and the </v>

300
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.220
<v Speaker 2>law itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is it.</v>

301
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.083
<v Speaker 2>This sounds really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way that I usually like to </v>

302
00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:11.430
<v Speaker 2>explain it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

303
00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:13.860
<v Speaker 2>right now people may say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well government clearly sms,</v>

304
00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:15.300
<v Speaker 2>monopoly over police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly,</v>

305
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:17.460
<v Speaker 2>overclock over courts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly over law,</v>

306
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.340
<v Speaker 2>and I say government has a monopoly over</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things right now.</v>

307
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Right now there's actually more private </v>
<v Speaker 2>security guards and police.</v>

308
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.730
<v Speaker 2>So is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

309
00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:27.564
<v Speaker 2>So you know there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more people hired by business </v>

310
00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:34.250
<v Speaker 2>and communities to go and do policing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there are police in the,</v>

311
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.790
<v Speaker 2>in the official sense.</v>

312
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.953
<v Speaker 2>And then you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for courts there is a huge area of </v>

313
00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:41.550
<v Speaker 2>private adjudication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's arbitration,</v>

314
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.470
<v Speaker 2>there is anytime you have a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your credit card,</v>

315
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:45.120
<v Speaker 2>do you sue the company?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This involved?</v>

316
00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:45.954
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You called the credit card company and </v>

317
00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:47.304
<v Speaker 2>they have their own internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjudication system for handling things </v>

318
00:14:49.951 --> 00:14:53.480
<v Speaker 2>like this on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have problems on facebook,</v>

319
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.130
<v Speaker 2>do you go into facebook?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

320
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go and you,</v>

321
00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.130
<v Speaker 2>when you complain with them and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about it,</v>

322
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.323
<v Speaker 2>and then essentially they really do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about it in the case of </v>

323
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:02.940
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we'll say,</v>

324
00:15:02.941 --> 00:15:03.771
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the minimum.</v>

325
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:05.750
<v Speaker 2>They give you a bunch of options to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve your own problem.</v>

326
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 2>You can block someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can unfriend them,</v>

327
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 2>you can make sure that they never </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact you again.</v>

328
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:10.484
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you a bunch of remedies that </v>

329
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are,</v>

330
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:14.354
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've worked out exactly what it is </v>

331
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 2>they want to do about it.</v>

332
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 2>similarly for your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for learning a lot self,</v>

334
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.384
<v Speaker 2>there are many private organizations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have their own rules that they </v>

335
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 2>apply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

336
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 2>mentioning I'll be up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So private arbitration,</v>

337
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:27.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the main reasons people use </v>

338
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 2>private arbitration is that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>use regular laws.</v>

339
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.203
<v Speaker 2>They use their own laws which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to work better than the </v>

340
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:34.994
<v Speaker 2>government's law so that you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your issue resolved in a few days </v>

341
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:39.350
<v Speaker 2>instead of weeks or years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

342
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:39.801
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:42.290
<v Speaker 2>like usually with a pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with private arbitration,</v>

344
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.393
<v Speaker 2>they have the arbitrator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually be someone who knows what he's </v>

345
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:45.464
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have someone who is in fact an </v>

346
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:48.044
<v Speaker 2>expert on this area of business ceos </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than giving it to a generalist </v>

347
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.084
<v Speaker 2>and 12 people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were too dumb to get out of jury </v>

348
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:55.960
<v Speaker 2>duty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

349
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 2>so just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of beginning realizing,</v>

350
00:15:57.801 --> 00:15:58.050
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

351
00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:58.883
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of private,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more private alternatives that already </v>

352
00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:04.680
<v Speaker 2>exists right now to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

353
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.550
<v Speaker 2>to government providing these services </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at first glance,</v>

354
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people just have the reaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it with justice society,</v>

355
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:10.424
<v Speaker 2>which is burned in flames.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there were private police or private </v>

356
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:16.220
<v Speaker 2>cloud or private courts are private law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look around.</v>

357
00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:17.054
<v Speaker 2>It's not burning now and there's already</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very large role for the private </v>

358
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:20.660
<v Speaker 2>sector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

359
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:21.510
<v Speaker 2>And then we will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think,</v>

360
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think about anarcho capitalist </v>

361
00:16:22.991 --> 00:16:23.930
<v Speaker 2>and I always just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

362
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:24.764
<v Speaker 2>well let's start when we got you realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is not going to lead anything </v>

363
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:29.480
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's very good reasons why people</v>

364
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 2>are using these private alternatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

365
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:34.490
<v Speaker 2>which is they're better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're worth the money you get,</v>

366
00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:35.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually get a,</v>

367
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:37.970
<v Speaker 2>you get a better quality for all four </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

368
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only for a lower price,</v>

369
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:39.974
<v Speaker 2>but remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are private companies competing </v>

370
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:42.674
<v Speaker 2>with free government services and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still carving out a big market </v>

371
00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:45.844
<v Speaker 2>niche for themselves because so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are so dissatisfied with these </v>

372
00:16:48.991 --> 00:16:49.824
<v Speaker 2>services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get provided free by the </v>

373
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:51.344
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

374
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.140
<v Speaker 2>And then just thinking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much further can we take these?</v>

375
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

376
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.910
<v Speaker 2>very easy with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

377
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with private arbitration,</v>

378
00:16:58.131 --> 00:16:58.964
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the big limits on private </v>

379
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:04.550
<v Speaker 2>arbitration is that even if you sign a </v>
<v Speaker 2>so called binding arbitration clause,</v>

380
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:05.920
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>

381
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the person that is,</v>

382
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.310
<v Speaker 2>if a person doesn't like how the binding</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration turns out,</v>

383
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.540
<v Speaker 2>they can go and they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

384
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 2>they can take it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

385
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.240
<v Speaker 2>if you sighing binding arbitration </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

386
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 2>know in the event of any of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>employment to dispute,</v>

387
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.113
<v Speaker 2>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will be handled by private </v>

388
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 2>arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

389
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that contract in general isn't like</v>

390
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.390
<v Speaker 2>while it might get a forced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

391
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 2>there's no confidence that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

392
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

393
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean like suppose that you could sign </v>
<v Speaker 2>this binding arbitration.</v>

394
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.960
<v Speaker 2>I could get my brother in law to go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the arbitrator.</v>

395
00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 2>He always rules in my favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could use this to get around a great</v>

396
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:42.974
<v Speaker 2>many government laws so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why government doesn't want </v>

397
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:46.034
<v Speaker 2>to do this and yet clearly you could go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and allow a lot more room for private </v>

398
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:51.310
<v Speaker 2>arbitration and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

399
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 2>and actually it is likely that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>immense,</v>

400
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.133
<v Speaker 2>immense pent up demand for private </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration that is right now being </v>

401
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:59.040
<v Speaker 2>stifled by regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

402
00:17:59.041 --> 00:17:59.874
<v Speaker 2>And then Uln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start thinking about how could </v>

403
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 2>there be even more ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

404
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:03.264
<v Speaker 2>so like one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one obvious one to me is you go </v>

405
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:09.060
<v Speaker 2>into government courts and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually if this,</v>

406
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.200
<v Speaker 2>if this is a private contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just just required,</v>

407
00:18:12.201 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 2>you just have to have an arbitration </v>
<v Speaker 2>clause and it's not our problem,</v>

408
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

409
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:16.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like you're so if you want,</v>

410
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 2>if you want adjudication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put an arbitration clause.</v>

411
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:19.883
<v Speaker 2>And all we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this butte is so it's the </v>

412
00:18:21.681 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 2>contract that says this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrator rubber stamp.</v>

413
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.223
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.093
<v Speaker 2>So maybe as an intermediate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intermediate step you would keep </v>

415
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.970
<v Speaker 2>criminal stuff exact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

416
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.343
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Move some of this stuff that's purely </v>

417
00:18:34.511 --> 00:18:36.440
<v Speaker 2>mentally bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

418
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.483
<v Speaker 2>So then when you just start thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all the things that you can hand </v>

419
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 2>over to the private sector to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>private sector,</v>

420
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is much larger than what pf and went </v>

421
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 2>through the what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what occurs the first.</v>

422
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:50.190
<v Speaker 2>And then the anarcho capitalist idea is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really once we,</v>

423
00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:51.024
<v Speaker 2>once we have privatized all the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at first it seemed like you </v>

424
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:55.614
<v Speaker 2>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just keep going further and </v>

425
00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 2>further and further the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're left with almost nothing.</v>

426
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.293
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you just get rid of that last </v>

427
00:19:01.951 --> 00:19:02.970
<v Speaker 2>bit's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

428
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.943
<v Speaker 2>let's pause on the left side for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second because you mentioned a few </v>

429
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:06.600
<v Speaker 2>different areas there.</v>

430
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 2>So I think the arbitration one's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

431
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering when you see cases of </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration now,</v>

432
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:12.863
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must self select a certain type of </v>

433
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:15.504
<v Speaker 2>person to go ahead and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What type of things are being fought in </v>

434
00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 2>arbitration?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

435
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:20.304
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you'd probably have to have a </v>

436
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:22.374
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of money you would not </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to maybe know that the person </v>

437
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:25.104
<v Speaker 2>across the table from you is in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar situation or has similar views </v>

438
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:28.764
<v Speaker 2>that they'd be willing to accept it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you just said right at the end </v>

439
00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:33.880
<v Speaker 2>they could probably figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get this back into the courts.</v>

440
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fairly common actually.</v>

441
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Just add it in as boiler plate into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>contract saying it will be arbitrated,</v>

442
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:40.380
<v Speaker 2>but the people who really wanted I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

443
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Speaker 2>or people have been burned by lawsuits </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past,</v>

444
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.583
<v Speaker 2>people who've seen business deals as </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed before their eyes because the </v>

445
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:46.974
<v Speaker 2>dispute came up and they didn't work it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and then it took years for them to </v>

446
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:50.550
<v Speaker 2>go and resolve it.</v>

447
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 2>And by then the business was bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the OCR or course if you've been sued</v>

448
00:19:55.171 --> 00:19:57.900
<v Speaker 2>by an employee and you think you and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even think it was bogus.</v>

449
00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I never want that to happen again.</v>

450
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.763
<v Speaker 2>So these are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some obvious cases and putting it </v>

451
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:04.790
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

452
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 2>chorusy like no employer is thrilled </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the idea of getting sued.</v>

453
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.700
<v Speaker 2>So like yelling and like if it were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing that you could really rely</v>

454
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:12.910
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

455
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I say I think it's very likely that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be like totally standard to put in</v>

456
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:17.424
<v Speaker 2>private arbitration and just to avoid or</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all like all the hassles that are </v>

457
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:22.960
<v Speaker 2>involved with hiring people right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

458
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:23.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

459
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:26.370
<v Speaker 2>if you think these laws are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then this is very distressing to you.</v>

460
00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:28.830
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone like me,</v>

461
00:20:28.831 --> 00:20:29.664
<v Speaker 2>the fact that almost everyone would </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably happily sign away the right to </v>

462
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:34.610
<v Speaker 2>sue their employer shows there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something very curt,</v>

463
00:20:34.611 --> 00:20:35.870
<v Speaker 2>very bad about the system we have.</v>

464
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:36.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

465
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.380
<v Speaker 2>it's the kind of thing that you have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to sue employers.</v>

466
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.223
<v Speaker 2>That kind of right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people will sign away for a small </v>

467
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:42.114
<v Speaker 2>amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that it's probably not a </v>

468
00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:46.350
<v Speaker 2>very valuable right to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the kind of thing that you're stuck</v>

469
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 2>with and it's in so many ways it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden because then you have to convince</v>

470
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 2>an employer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to sue you.</v>

471
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool.</v>

472
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.823
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it also that the average person </v>

473
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 2>who works for even a small company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just a giant corporation,</v>

474
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 2>we don't have lawyers on retainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I work for myself now,</v>

475
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:02.104
<v Speaker 2>which is a pretty beautiful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've worked at plenty of companies </v>

476
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:04.954
<v Speaker 2>where the day I got hired I had to sign </v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy book of all the pressure and </v>

477
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 2>of course I didn't read all that stuff.</v>

478
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's like I'm not walking around with</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lawyer and most people are.</v>

479
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.043
<v Speaker 2>So many people are just signing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>without even knowing what they're </v>

480
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:16.204
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I would say is thank goodness for </v>

481
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:19.084
<v Speaker 2>that because if people were actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are actually taking it more </v>

482
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 2>seriously and you'll see where you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

483
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.910
<v Speaker 2>firms are taking advantage of that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to go and diluted as much as the law</v>

485
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:31.240
<v Speaker 2>will allow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

486
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:32.074
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the regulations are bad in the </v>

487
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:34.114
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for people diluting the </v>

488
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 2>regulations as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an old saying,</v>

489
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:41.100
<v Speaker 2>thank God we don't get as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>government to be paid for.</v>

490
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.133
<v Speaker 2>I say also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God we don't sue people to </v>

491
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:44.614
<v Speaker 2>anywhere near the extent that we legally</v>
<v Speaker 2>could because it would be a hellish </v>

492
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:48.030
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

493
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.810
<v Speaker 2>This may sound like a very amateur </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

494
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:53.890
<v Speaker 2>but when people go into arbitration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you bringing a lawyer with you or is</v>

495
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 2>it just that the arbitrator is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at what was signed and deciding?</v>

496
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Like is there an actual argument that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking place?</v>

497
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 2>So I think it varies a lot so sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might bring a lawyer so you know,</v>

498
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 2>so we'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may actually depend upon the rules of</v>

499
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:07.220
<v Speaker 2>the arbitration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

500
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.840
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of the ideas just to cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>the expenses down so the.</v>

501
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.683
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times you don't have a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have an arbitrator there who </v>

502
00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:13.894
<v Speaker 2>generally is well versed in the industry</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're working in so he actually </v>

503
00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:20.530
<v Speaker 2>knows what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course you know part of what</v>

504
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:21.364
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something more moderate </v>

505
00:22:21.911 --> 00:22:22.744
<v Speaker 2>called mediation where the arbitrator </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter where the person doesn't </v>

506
00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 2>really get to decide anything but just </v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to get the two people to talk.</v>

507
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:31.810
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like counseling and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration is stronger where he listens</v>

508
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:33.670
<v Speaker 2>to both sides and then he tells you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what's going to be.</v>

509
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Is there a set time frame on how long </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lasts?</v>

510
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:37.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

511
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Certainly not always a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since this is private,</v>

512
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

513
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.183
<v Speaker 2>there's a wide range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a beautiful rainbow of all </v>

514
00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:46.120
<v Speaker 2>possibilities so we know which are all </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

515
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

516
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's an arbitrator who just</v>

517
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 2>says looking at like we need tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it Robert.</v>

518
00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 2>And that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what's gonna happen.</v>

519
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.360
<v Speaker 2>And even part of the beauty of that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get the dispute resolved,</v>

520
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you can go back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>working with each other.</v>

521
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.503
<v Speaker 2>We may not be that happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like there's no longer an </v>

522
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:06.520
<v Speaker 2>ongoing dispute and so it's settled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he can get back to business and you</v>

523
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 2>haven't paid and insane amount to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers.</v>

524
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Lawyers aren't thrilled with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

525
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:12.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not immediately.</v>

526
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 2>So of course their sob who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial enough to see,</v>

527
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:16.360
<v Speaker 2>well this is an opportunity for me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>branch out,</v>

528
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.490
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be very bad for lawyers</v>

529
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the long running.</v>

530
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.190
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for litigators particularly,</v>

531
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 2>which is a small minority of lawyers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place,</v>

532
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.273
<v Speaker 2>assuming like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

534
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.123
<v Speaker 2>like for a contract lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this might be awesome because then </v>

535
00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:29.554
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there'd be a bunch of people who </v>

536
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:31.624
<v Speaker 2>want to rewrite all their contracts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go and putting by putting binding </v>

537
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 2>arbitration that's truly and utterly </v>
<v Speaker 2>binding.</v>

538
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

539
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.740
<v Speaker 2>so you mentioned earlier that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>policing could be pressurized,</v>

540
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.783
<v Speaker 2>but what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can understand that a place like </v>

541
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.124
<v Speaker 2>beverly hills people got a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to prioritize the Beverly </v>

542
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.023
<v Speaker 2>Hills Police Department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beverly Hills Cop.</v>

543
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the movie that wasn't what the </v>

544
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 2>movie was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had to get that in there somehow.</v>

545
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.480
<v Speaker 2>But what wasn't a place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about in a place where they're at,</v>

546
00:23:57.481 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 2>where the economics are terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people have no money,</v>

547
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 2>we're probably crime is the highest.</v>

548
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to put in money to.</v>

549
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 2>How are you gonna make a profit off </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

550
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

551
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.711
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

552
00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:06.290
<v Speaker 2>keeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize.</v>

553
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.123
<v Speaker 2>So those places work where crime is </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible or ones where the current </v>

554
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:11.710
<v Speaker 2>police already don't work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're just,</v>

555
00:24:11.711 --> 00:24:12.544
<v Speaker 2>we're stepping back and realizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current system is quite grumpy to begin </v>

556
00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 2>with now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

557
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 2>who would pay for it otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

558
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 2>the obvious place to start are people </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually are landlords.</v>

559
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.173
<v Speaker 2>So like in a more suburban area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about homeowners </v>

560
00:24:23.411 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 2>associations are some of the obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to pay for it,</v>

561
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.430
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even now in that area is very common for</v>

562
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 2>landlords to pay for some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>

563
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:35.260
<v Speaker 2>And if they know that it's their job to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it in a high crime area,</v>

564
00:24:35.401 --> 00:24:36.234
<v Speaker 2>you'll even someone who is poor is </v>
<v Speaker 2>galliano values their life values </v>

565
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 2>protection.</v>

566
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.910
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of like a,</v>

567
00:24:40.911 --> 00:24:42.590
<v Speaker 2>like an economist joke has been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

568
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:45.350
<v Speaker 2>you see a lot of really expensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>sneakers and bad areas down,</v>

569
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 2>but why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well like when it's a priority,</v>

570
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:51.410
<v Speaker 2>people will come up with the money in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to pay for things that they really</v>

571
00:24:51.411 --> 00:24:53.270
<v Speaker 2>care about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

572
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:55.430
<v Speaker 2>the other thing about policing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it's also better to think</v>

573
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:58.400
<v Speaker 2>about it and in a broader category of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just enforcement of all kinds.</v>

574
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.550
<v Speaker 2>So there's many kinds of enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>besides actual police.</v>

575
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:02.384
<v Speaker 2>So one that's become very common with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet is the all kinds of </v>

576
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 2>reputational incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

577
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:09.560
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

578
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.600
<v Speaker 2>just like bad reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like this,</v>

579
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:14.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these work far better than like the FDA.</v>

580
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:15.044
<v Speaker 2>So you like imagine you get a bad meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you go and call it the FDA and </v>

581
00:25:17.491 --> 00:25:20.750
<v Speaker 2>complain about it or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like local meat inspectors know,</v>

582
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:23.450
<v Speaker 2>like much more likely to go and put in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad yelp review.</v>

583
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.690
<v Speaker 2>And this is the way that we are probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting most of our actual enforcements.</v>

584
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you like how,</v>

585
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 2>what is protecting you from food </v>
<v Speaker 2>poisoning?</v>

586
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:31.364
<v Speaker 2>Is it the government now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government's hardly doing anything </v>

587
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:34.094
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really protecting you from food </v>

588
00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:35.384
<v Speaker 2>poisoning is always word of mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is now amplified because there's </v>

589
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it is word of the Internet.</v>

590
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one complaints.</v>

591
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.520
<v Speaker 2>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad runs an internet business,</v>

592
00:25:43.521 --> 00:25:44.354
<v Speaker 2>like one disgruntled customer is </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible for you and is really a much </v>

593
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 2>more effective enforcement mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything in the government is doing</v>

594
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:53.030
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of it that it just,</v>

595
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 2>the messaging has to be clear because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that concept seems very obvious to me in</v>

596
00:25:57.831 --> 00:25:59.840
<v Speaker 2>a day of the Internet where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

597
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.913
<v Speaker 2>people care now more about what a yelp </v>
<v Speaker 2>review of a restaurant says than what </v>

598
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:08.050
<v Speaker 2>either a written review in the La Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>says or what,</v>

599
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

600
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 2>what it says at the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're telling you themselves.</v>

601
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is really about messaging in a</v>

602
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:17.600
<v Speaker 2>way more than economics because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can get there economically.</v>

603
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

604
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And then again also just thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that you can get a contract between</v>

605
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:25.890
<v Speaker 2>people that you don't ordinarily think </v>
<v Speaker 2>of as a,</v>

606
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.330
<v Speaker 2>as a contractual relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now we also like,</v>

607
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:31.220
<v Speaker 2>if you get an accident with someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd only car accident.</v>

608
00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:32.054
<v Speaker 2>You don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a contract with the </v>

609
00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:35.210
<v Speaker 2>person who got an accident with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you both have insurance,</v>

610
00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:36.044
<v Speaker 2>your insurance company has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with their insurance </v>

611
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:38.800
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

612
00:26:38.801 --> 00:26:39.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

613
00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:40.034
<v Speaker 2>most auto accidents never go to trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The insurance companies have a system </v>

614
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 2>that they work out where they negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>

615
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 2>they've got standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

616
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:48.330
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's already going on.</v>

617
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And then just think about anytime you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a public place,</v>

618
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:53.140
<v Speaker 2>anytime you're in a mall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

619
00:26:53.141 --> 00:26:54.750
<v Speaker 2>like you are right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

620
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:56.380
<v Speaker 2>if there's a dispute there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police will handle it.</v>

621
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 2>But it is very easy to visualize a world</v>
<v Speaker 2>where when you go to the mall,</v>

622
00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:02.310
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a sign saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

623
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.173
<v Speaker 2>so when you enter this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come under the jurisdiction of this </v>

624
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:06.144
<v Speaker 2>arbitration company and Alice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then any dispute that happens in </v>

625
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 2>them all then is no longer actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be handled by the police.</v>

626
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:13.801
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

627
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:14.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

628
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.054
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

629
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.060
<v Speaker 2>and of course people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

630
00:27:16.061 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just ran a cops,</v>

631
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even have,</v>

632
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them don't ever really have </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

633
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:20.743
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course if the taxpayers will pay for </v>

634
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 2>someone to be shot at than pe companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not going to pay or not going to pay</v>

635
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:27.190
<v Speaker 2>the extra amount to have their </v>
<v Speaker 2>employees.</v>

636
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.330
<v Speaker 2>So the whole system of economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sort of flipped if we.</v>

637
00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

638
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.790
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.923
<v Speaker 2>the amazing thing about all of the kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of private of private law that we see </v>

640
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:40.170
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that how little it does,</v>

641
00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:41.004
<v Speaker 2>but how much it does given that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government provides these services free </v>

642
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:43.764
<v Speaker 2>of charge and people still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will take money out of their own </v>

643
00:27:46.201 --> 00:27:49.410
<v Speaker 2>pockets to go rather than go and get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>free stuff.</v>

644
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.401
<v Speaker 2>Which yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

645
00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:51.300
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

646
00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:52.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you know,</v>

647
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.843
<v Speaker 2>it's always the incense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not free because you have to pay </v>

648
00:27:53.611 --> 00:27:55.140
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in another sense it is free.</v>

649
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Namely you can use it without any </v>
<v Speaker 2>additional charge.</v>

650
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's the sense in which this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>is free.</v>

651
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes they'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get charged for a false alarm,</v>

652
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.014
<v Speaker 2>although that's pretty unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like the fire departments sometimes </v>

653
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 2>you call them for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll sit,</v>

654
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:09.020
<v Speaker 2>they'll give you a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bales.</v>

655
00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:09.854
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you go and waste valuable </v>

656
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:13.020
<v Speaker 2>services?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But normally that's not how it works.</v>

657
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.913
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned a car insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does health insurance fall on </v>

658
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.693
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because how the Germans right now is </v>

659
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:20.180
<v Speaker 2>making everyone completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

660
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.070
<v Speaker 2>no matter what side you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is crazy about this.</v>

661
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:23.904
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is then the answer for health </v>

662
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:26.604
<v Speaker 2>insurance in your view?</v>

663
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

664
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 2>well I guess that's probably the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>question I'll ask you for the interview.</v>

665
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.510
<v Speaker 2>So no health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

666
00:28:36.511 --> 00:28:37.344
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the extreme view that there's no </v>

667
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:40.830
<v Speaker 2>reason for government to be involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this area at all.</v>

668
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.053
<v Speaker 2>And what's very striking is that while </v>
<v Speaker 2>most economists officially sell will </v>

669
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.460
<v Speaker 2>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>

670
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.333
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I've actually got an argue with </v>

671
00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:51.030
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually when they argue for regulation,</v>

672
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.880
<v Speaker 2>they're arguing for regulations to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>other regulations.</v>

673
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:54.871
<v Speaker 2>And when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

674
00:28:54.871 --> 00:28:57.630
<v Speaker 2>what if we just didn't have the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations are trying to fix,</v>

675
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.733
<v Speaker 2>then the reaction is kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I never really thought about it </v>

676
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:02.610
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just for example,</v>

677
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

678
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:06.300
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of Obamacare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that all right?</v>

679
00:29:06.301 --> 00:29:07.134
<v Speaker 2>Well first we're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation saying that you can't turn </v>

680
00:29:09.121 --> 00:29:11.150
<v Speaker 2>people down for insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And secondly,</v>

681
00:29:11.151 --> 00:29:13.830
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna have a regulation saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't charge them higher prices</v>

682
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.700
<v Speaker 2>and then people normally realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

683
00:29:16.701 --> 00:29:18.060
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you a system like that,</v>

684
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:18.894
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people just wait around </v>
<v Speaker 2>until they're sick and so then we're </v>

685
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:22.650
<v Speaker 2>going to require people to buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance,</v>

686
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.410
<v Speaker 2>to avoid the problems created by the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations.</v>

687
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.573
<v Speaker 2>And then we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's people too poor to afford </v>

688
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:28.974
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we're going to subsidize those </v>

689
00:29:29.551 --> 00:29:31.430
<v Speaker 2>people to deal with the other three </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations.</v>

690
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:32.970
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

691
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:33.961
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

692
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:34.794
<v Speaker 2>my view is there's really no reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't have scrapped all the </v>

693
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:37.950
<v Speaker 2>regulation and just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

694
00:29:37.951 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 2>here's your incentive by insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wait until you're sick,</v>

695
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.823
<v Speaker 2>you won't be able to afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then what do you do for those </v>

696
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:44.441
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

697
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 2>so I guess I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't,</v>

698
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 2>than what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens as a result of that is that</v>

699
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:51.483
<v Speaker 2>x amount of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be a lot of people </v>

700
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:53.464
<v Speaker 2>simply will not do it because they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather spend their money elsewhere and </v>

701
00:29:56.741 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 2>hope that there'll be healthy or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they'll just get a broken leg playing</v>

702
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 2>basketball or something else or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

703
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:02.443
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we still end up paying for </v>

704
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

705
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.941
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't address them,</v>

706
00:30:04.941 --> 00:30:06.490
<v Speaker 2>will automatically end up paying for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

707
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Not automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

708
00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:08.524
<v Speaker 2>if you get rid of all those regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then for service and then you have </v>

709
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:13.354
<v Speaker 2>to rely on charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course charity includes family </v>

710
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:19.630
<v Speaker 2>includes everybody else that might want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to help you,</v>

711
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 2>but that you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's terrible.</v>

712
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

713
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:24.454
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you buy insurance and </v>

714
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 2>advances because you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in that position.</v>

715
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course then you started late start</v>

716
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:32.980
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the horrible cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what about a child boards,</v>

717
00:30:32.981 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 2>they're responsible parents and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>child is a lifelong congenital disease.</v>

718
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.903
<v Speaker 2>I say that's the kind of thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>charities are going to be very well </v>

719
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:40.024
<v Speaker 2>equipped to handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably not going to be so </v>

720
00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:44.860
<v Speaker 2>equipped to handle someone who's 25 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was earning a middle class income.</v>

721
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.693
<v Speaker 2>It didn't feel like buying insurance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they come down with a horrible </v>

722
00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:48.094
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are ones where I think you're </v>

723
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:50.643
<v Speaker 2>likely to be very low in priority and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's world like you're an adult and it </v>

724
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 2>was your responsibility to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

725
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:55.663
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sort of in the background is the </v>

726
00:30:57.161 --> 00:30:57.994
<v Speaker 2>issue of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you be so callous as to say if </v>

727
00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 2>you went and did something really dumb </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's just your own tough luck.</v>

728
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 2>And so I have this old blog post called </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough luck,</v>

729
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.323
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know what every political </v>

730
00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Speaker 2>philosophy ultimately says tough luck to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

731
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.460
<v Speaker 2>It's just a question of where they draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>the line.</v>

732
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:14.950
<v Speaker 2>So you know there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

733
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.993
<v Speaker 2>what if there's a conservative go </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative government power and they </v>

734
00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:22.480
<v Speaker 2>can skip my son and he sent to another </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and you get Eddie dies.</v>

735
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 2>What happens then?</v>

736
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And of course the conservative answer is</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,</v>

737
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough luck.</v>

738
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:29.283
<v Speaker 2>That's the system like in my system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be conscripted if I didn't </v>

739
00:31:31.871 --> 00:31:32.681
<v Speaker 2>worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to.</v>

740
00:31:32.681 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes when that happens you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>put into a lethal area and you die.</v>

741
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.473
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well my life has been ruined and what </v>

742
00:31:38.631 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 2>are you going to do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

743
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 2>And they'll give you a plaque or similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>yellow or the yellow like,</v>

744
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>similarly like,</v>

745
00:31:46.211 --> 00:31:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

746
00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even someone who is these a </v>

747
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 2>supporter in the world of socialized </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>

748
00:31:51.821 --> 00:31:56.260
<v Speaker 2>So what if a person goes and cuts off </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own legs and then.</v>

749
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.150
<v Speaker 2>And then whenever you go and send </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to help them,</v>

750
00:31:58.151 --> 00:31:59.980
<v Speaker 2>they throw things at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do then?</v>

751
00:31:59.981 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Well then I guess tough luck all and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that person,</v>

752
00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:05.980
<v Speaker 2>is this going to be alone and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering because they wouldn't go along</v>

753
00:32:05.981 --> 00:32:06.814
<v Speaker 2>with the system.</v>

754
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.773
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So given that every single philosophy </v>

755
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:10.084
<v Speaker 2>ultimately says tough luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why people who believe in </v>

756
00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:15.880
<v Speaker 2>the free market should feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially embarrassed to say,</v>

757
00:32:15.881 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my system.</v>

758
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:17.584
<v Speaker 2>This is where we draw the line and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have failed to do all of these </v>

759
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:22.120
<v Speaker 2>things than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's here.</v>

760
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Then it's your problem because there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>no perfect system based.</v>

761
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.193
<v Speaker 2>There's no perfect system and and again </v>
<v Speaker 2>like would it be a perfect system if </v>

762
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.123
<v Speaker 2>someone could be completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible 100 times in a row and </v>

763
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:33.640
<v Speaker 2>would still get treated like everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else?</v>

764
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:34.863
<v Speaker 2>Have they done any studies that you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>of where they've shown where in cases </v>

765
00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 2>that the government pulls back that</v>

766
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 1>charity does take care of this stuff so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the case,</v>

767
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like philosophically,</v>

768
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I fully get what you're saying there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if we just pulled back a little bit</v>

769
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 1>that people would give more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there evidence of that?</v>

770
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Because I just</v>

771
00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.170
<v Speaker 2>so well so it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost all the evidence is the other way</v>

772
00:32:56.171 --> 00:32:57.004
<v Speaker 2>around where it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There used to be private charity and </v>

773
00:32:58.961 --> 00:33:01.690
<v Speaker 2>then government started doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then people measure what happened to the</v>

774
00:33:01.691 --> 00:33:05.290
<v Speaker 2>charity that was involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is called crowding out.</v>

775
00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:07.600
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole field economic charity </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they study this,</v>

776
00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.673
<v Speaker 2>and this is a totally standard result </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are many areas that private </v>

777
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:15.730
<v Speaker 2>charity used to take care of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like helping out the poor a demand now.</v>

778
00:33:15.731 --> 00:33:16.564
<v Speaker 2>And as government expanded its role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the role of private charity shrank down </v>

779
00:33:19.301 --> 00:33:20.134
<v Speaker 2>and eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually private charity moved into </v>

780
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:21.874
<v Speaker 2>other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government wasn't doing very much </v>

781
00:33:22.571 --> 00:33:23.860
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

782
00:33:23.861 --> 00:33:24.694
<v Speaker 2>so you like in the thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really only really use the </v>

783
00:33:28.271 --> 00:33:29.104
<v Speaker 2>thirties or sort of when there was a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>transition because there were many </v>

784
00:33:30.761 --> 00:33:31.594
<v Speaker 2>private organizations are things called </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraternal clubs and organizations that </v>

785
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:35.853
<v Speaker 2>were private clubs that did a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that the modern welfare state </v>

786
00:33:38.201 --> 00:33:38.560
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

787
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.870
<v Speaker 2>So if you lost your job that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take care of you.</v>

788
00:33:40.871 --> 00:33:42.940
<v Speaker 2>If there were sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go and take care of you.</v>

789
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thirties was single.</v>

790
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:48.480
<v Speaker 2>It was such a protractive depression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression that fight,</v>

791
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.620
<v Speaker 2>that partly started breaking down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

792
00:33:50.621 --> 00:33:52.090
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it was government.</v>

793
00:33:52.091 --> 00:33:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Taylor took over and once government </v>
<v Speaker 2>took over,</v>

794
00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.203
<v Speaker 2>there really wasn't much point to belong</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the organizations anymore except to </v>

795
00:33:57.071 --> 00:33:59.710
<v Speaker 2>go and put on funny hats and have one </v>
<v Speaker 2>once a month.</v>

796
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:00.821
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot.</v>

797
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:05.110
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these groups they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember your grandfather being part</v>

798
00:34:05.111 --> 00:34:05.944
<v Speaker 2>of like the elks or the odd fellows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These actually provided these welfare </v>

799
00:34:08.981 --> 00:34:10.780
<v Speaker 2>state functions privately in the past.</v>

800
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.720
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>government funded planned parenthood,</v>

801
00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:17.550
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure regardless of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings on abortion,</v>

802
00:34:17.551 --> 00:34:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're not for the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding that I can accept that part.</v>

803
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.130
<v Speaker 1>So for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro choice,</v>

804
00:34:23.131 --> 00:34:23.964
<v Speaker 1>but when I see all these people talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about public funding of all of these </v>

805
00:34:25.711 --> 00:34:26.544
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem to me that if the </v>

806
00:34:28.321 --> 00:34:29.154
<v Speaker 1>government stopped funding these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not made the illegal abortion but </v>

807
00:34:32.911 --> 00:34:33.744
<v Speaker 1>stopped funding that this seems like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>case were so many people are so </v>

808
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.360
<v Speaker 1>passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

809
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.253
<v Speaker 1>all these people in Hollywood who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly tweeting about this and </v>

810
00:34:40.321 --> 00:34:41.154
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

811
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.290
<v Speaker 1>But they would start funding these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

812
00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:44.480
<v Speaker 1>So is that a great example?</v>

813
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I think if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a great example.</v>

814
00:34:46.261 --> 00:34:47.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're the here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

815
00:34:47.641 --> 00:34:48.474
<v Speaker 2>here's the main thing that is troubling </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the economics of charity is </v>

816
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:53.100
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of cars of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they care about and those.</v>

817
00:34:53.101 --> 00:34:53.934
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gonna be plenty of money for </v>

818
00:34:55.201 --> 00:34:57.210
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of other terrible things</v>

819
00:34:57.211 --> 00:34:59.070
<v Speaker 2>happening in the world that private </v>
<v Speaker 2>charity,</v>

820
00:34:59.071 --> 00:35:00.540
<v Speaker 2>manifestly Evans hasn't solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

821
00:35:00.541 --> 00:35:01.374
<v Speaker 2>hasn't gone unsolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>International refugee problems and you </v>

822
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.253
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's doing something but they're still </v>

823
00:35:05.311 --> 00:35:06.144
<v Speaker 2>terrible things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't solved a hunger in other </v>

824
00:35:07.921 --> 00:35:09.000
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

825
00:35:09.001 --> 00:35:09.834
<v Speaker 2>the thing is that these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are problems that taxpayers don't </v>

826
00:35:11.881 --> 00:35:14.820
<v Speaker 2>care much about and that charitable gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>her some care very much about.</v>

827
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:16.240
<v Speaker 2>So not you'll say we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

828
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Bill Gates cares and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

829
00:35:18.391 --> 00:35:19.224
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's making a single handily making a </v>

830
00:35:20.531 --> 00:35:22.860
<v Speaker 2>noticeable in the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

831
00:35:22.861 --> 00:35:25.650
<v Speaker 2>so will sort of like the issues that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are really concerned about.</v>

832
00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:28.440
<v Speaker 2>The ones that have a lot of support for </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxpayers to do something about it,</v>

833
00:35:28.441 --> 00:35:32.670
<v Speaker 2>about them are also very plausibly ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>were private donors.</v>

834
00:35:32.671 --> 00:35:33.504
<v Speaker 2>We care a lot as well.</v>

835
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any situation where you think </v>

836
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 1>regulation is necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>

837
00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:38.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will.</v>

838
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone watching this is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to comment.</v>

839
00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the rivers?</v>

840
00:35:42.141 --> 00:35:44.130
<v Speaker 1>They're going to pollute all the rivers </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything.</v>

841
00:35:44.131 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Is there any instance where you see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as.</v>

842
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me,</v>

843
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.930
<v Speaker 2>what I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

844
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I would say so then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:35:50.541 --> 00:35:51.374
<v Speaker 2>the again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of areas where given </v>

846
00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given Gary,</v>

847
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.560
<v Speaker 2>given the current setup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to see how,</v>

848
00:35:55.561 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

849
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.610
<v Speaker 2>like how either a for profit or even a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shared a response to it.</v>

850
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:00.511
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

851
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:01.344
<v Speaker 2>the question in my mind is always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we imagine going into privatizing </v>

852
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:05.160
<v Speaker 2>things that government to government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ngo,</v>

853
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.013
<v Speaker 2>government now does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what's left and then what's left </v>

854
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:11.210
<v Speaker 2>the charity can't handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

855
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 2>and again that's to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

856
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 2>part of being an advocate of capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>is least saying,</v>

857
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.673
<v Speaker 2>well let's privatized and see before </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying there's no way that private </v>

858
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 2>action are you going to handle this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

859
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:22.164
<v Speaker 2>Let's go and take and take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course all the private solutions </v>

860
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 2>may take a while to emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>

861
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.851
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

862
00:36:27.851 --> 00:36:30.990
<v Speaker 2>like there are many problems the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government has dealt with very poorly so</v>

863
00:36:30.991 --> 00:36:31.350
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>

864
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it's fair to say after </v>
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>

865
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>private sector hasn't solved this yet,</v>

866
00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:36.774
<v Speaker 2>so therefore clearly governments as </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory will let me give it some more </v>

867
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:40.320
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

868
00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:42.990
<v Speaker 2>like the ones that I think are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearest cases are,</v>

869
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>air pollution.</v>

870
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:48.410
<v Speaker 2>So that's one where it's very hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly see how the privates,</v>

871
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 2>like how for profit for profit sector </v>
<v Speaker 2>would handle it.</v>

872
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.370
<v Speaker 2>It's one where because air pollution </v>
<v Speaker 2>moves across the,</v>

873
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.290
<v Speaker 2>they're bullish moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's like you,</v>

874
00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:58.230
<v Speaker 2>you're not walking around in a bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

875
00:36:58.231 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Speaker 2>it's one where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well again,</v>

876
00:36:59.821 --> 00:37:02.580
<v Speaker 2>you're suppose that government didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about it,</v>

877
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 2>but there's private charity involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

878
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Private charity to go and say subsidized</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower l,</v>

879
00:37:06.611 --> 00:37:08.940
<v Speaker 2>lower polluting technologies or offer </v>
<v Speaker 2>prizes for lower,</v>

880
00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.680
<v Speaker 2>lower polluting technologies and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>give away the patent so that these,</v>

881
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.090
<v Speaker 2>the new technologies are really cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get in.</v>

882
00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:17.430
<v Speaker 2>So like us to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how well that will work.</v>

883
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly would have to say it's so far</v>

884
00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 2>from where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

885
00:37:21.001 --> 00:37:23.130
<v Speaker 2>But I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should give it a try.</v>

886
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most people watching this know that </v>

887
00:37:25.431 --> 00:37:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm a limited government guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in states rights.</v>

888
00:37:27.741 --> 00:37:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I would always rather be governed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

889
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:30.643
<v Speaker 1>by my mayor and my local representative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then February will be governed by </v>

890
00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:35.710
<v Speaker 1>the mayor of Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

891
00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.910
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a little,</v>

892
00:37:37.911 --> 00:37:40.820
<v Speaker 1>he lives a little closer to me than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the people in DC,</v>

893
00:37:40.821 --> 00:37:41.654
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of my feelings of the mayor </v>

894
00:37:43.371 --> 00:37:45.440
<v Speaker 1>of Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But generally speaking I want,</v>

895
00:37:45.441 --> 00:37:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I believe in local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local control.</v>

896
00:37:47.481 --> 00:37:52.130
<v Speaker 1>So are there instances where local </v>
<v Speaker 1>control has done this better?</v>

897
00:37:52.131 --> 00:37:52.964
<v Speaker 1>Like is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a town you can point to or is </v>

898
00:37:54.471 --> 00:37:57.110
<v Speaker 1>there a state maybe that's doing some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this a little bit better?</v>

899
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.163
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So given that there are so many states </v>

900
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:02.880
<v Speaker 2>and localities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that there are,</v>

901
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know off the top of the head </v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

902
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.480
<v Speaker 2>which one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ones they are,</v>

903
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.860
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like</v>

904
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.720
<v Speaker 1>is that partly just because the feds now</v>
<v Speaker 1>have so much control over everything?</v>

905
00:38:11.721 --> 00:38:12.830
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for states to do that.</v>

906
00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:13.721
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

907
00:38:13.721 --> 00:38:14.291
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blank,</v>

908
00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:16.300
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so states do manage enormous amount.</v>

909
00:38:16.301 --> 00:38:17.134
<v Speaker 2>I'd say the main issue actually is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the federal government provides so </v>

910
00:38:19.691 --> 00:38:20.524
<v Speaker 2>much of the money for state governments </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of the competitive pressure </v>

911
00:38:24.701 --> 00:38:25.534
<v Speaker 2>that you think would be operating is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has really been neutered by the fact </v>

912
00:38:29.171 --> 00:38:30.004
<v Speaker 2>that states are just receive a bag of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money from the federal government for </v>

913
00:38:32.741 --> 00:38:33.574
<v Speaker 2>certain purposes and if they aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to and use it for other </v>

914
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:36.484
<v Speaker 2>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they have very little incentive </v>

915
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:40.960
<v Speaker 2>to try to figure out a way of saving </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxpayers and the taxpayers money on it.</v>

916
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 2>And often the money of course comes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of strings attached.</v>

917
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.420
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want this rings and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to give back all the money.</v>

918
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 2>So very few places want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what would you do in a case when,</v>

919
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

920
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.980
<v Speaker 2>when we hear about federal money being </v>
<v Speaker 2>used and everyone says,</v>

921
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like for example,</v>

922
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:56.291
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:57.124
<v Speaker 2>Hurricane Sandy Hits in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jersey shore is destroyed and then </v>

924
00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Obama was probably hundreds of millions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of dollars.</v>

925
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know off the top of my head or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.</v>

926
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Do you again this would be the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

927
00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I think so like probably on private </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance,</v>

928
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason that you couldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>private disaster insurance and of course</v>

929
00:39:14.591 --> 00:39:16.510
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot of private jets or </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance sold.</v>

930
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:17.703
<v Speaker 2>Normally the feds get in where this area</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so high risk that the insurance will </v>

931
00:39:20.661 --> 00:39:23.920
<v Speaker 2>be really expensive and people will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>chomps don't feel like having to pay for</v>

932
00:39:23.921 --> 00:39:25.680
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so either the Fed,</v>

933
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 2>the feds take care of it or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidize it and again,</v>

934
00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:29.081
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

935
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:29.914
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially to me the idea that someone </v>

936
00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:31.924
<v Speaker 2>with a beach house to get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidized insurance because it's a </v>

937
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.820
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a high disaster area around.</v>

938
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I like the disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always baffled by that.</v>

939
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.030
<v Speaker 2>They're limited in a beach house.</v>

940
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:41.223
<v Speaker 2>Why can't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't a person in a beach house be </v>

941
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 2>expected to buy their own insurance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

942
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:45.904
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them do have insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they pay full market price for the </v>

943
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:52.140
<v Speaker 2>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ultimately in a case like that would,</v>

944
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.110
<v Speaker 2>would people then be forced to move from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place like.</v>

945
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.060
<v Speaker 2>So either you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

946
00:39:58.061 --> 00:40:00.970
<v Speaker 2>here's what we want to really be forced </v>
<v Speaker 2>to move and tell the value of your home.</v>

947
00:40:00.971 --> 00:40:02.860
<v Speaker 2>False now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

948
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 2>but eventually maybe a self select out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

949
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like really?</v>

950
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Like really what would happen given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach homes normally are very valuable,</v>

951
00:40:11.231 --> 00:40:12.064
<v Speaker 2>is that those homes would just be worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>less because people realize if I move </v>

952
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:15.604
<v Speaker 2>into this home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have to buy some really </v>

953
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 2>expensive insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that doesn't sound very good.</v>

954
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 2>So ultimately of the like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

955
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.633
<v Speaker 2>like subsidizing disaster insurance is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidy to people who develop in high </v>

956
00:40:24.961 --> 00:40:25.794
<v Speaker 2>and high and disaster prone areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the on land in those areas </v>

957
00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:29.914
<v Speaker 2>are ultimately the people who really </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit from it because it raises the </v>

958
00:40:31.871 --> 00:40:32.704
<v Speaker 2>value of that real estate's I guess I </v>
<v Speaker 2>never really thought about it in those </v>

959
00:40:34.991 --> 00:40:36.040
<v Speaker 2>specific terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

960
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:36.874
<v Speaker 2>I drive by Malibu here which is gorgeous</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these rich people living on </v>

961
00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:43.090
<v Speaker 2>these cliffs right on the water and at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day if something horrible</v>

962
00:40:43.091 --> 00:40:43.924
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course we meet horrific </v>

963
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.060
<v Speaker 2>government would be then giving money to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who chose to live there in a high</v>

964
00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:49.894
<v Speaker 2>risk thing because their insurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't go above and beyond whatever the </v>

965
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>necessary of government requirements.</v>

966
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me and my family lives in this area,</v>

967
00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 2>so are laborers a couple miles from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>North Ridge earthquake and back in 1994.</v>

968
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:00.783
<v Speaker 2>And I know relatives who were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling up fema and say and give me </v>

969
00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:04.960
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me money.</v>

970
00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:06.660
<v Speaker 2>And they got money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yell.</v>

971
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 2>It didn't matter like how rich you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>or like what you had done or whether you</v>

972
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:12.180
<v Speaker 2>had built your home safely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

973
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.053
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just the squeaky wheel gets the </v>

974
00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:15.004
<v Speaker 2>grease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really all you have to do is pick up a </v>

975
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:16.474
<v Speaker 2>phone and so is that the real problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all of this that ultimately by </v>

976
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:25.411
<v Speaker 2>doing all of this regulation that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>punish people who do the right thing.</v>

977
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 2>In a case like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's someone who built their house,</v>

978
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:29.314
<v Speaker 2>earthquake safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bob invested their own money and all of </v>

979
00:41:31.721 --> 00:41:32.980
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe had some,</v>

980
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Northridge</v>

981
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 1>was a massive earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they're getting,</v>

982
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 1>they're not getting government money </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they did the right thing and put</v>

983
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:41.084
<v Speaker 1>their own money in it.</v>

984
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like.</v>

985
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>

986
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:45.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair.</v>

987
00:41:45.171 --> 00:41:46.004
<v Speaker 2>It's not just economists would also </v>
<v Speaker 2>point out is that it's highly </v>

988
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:49.094
<v Speaker 2>inefficient because you're giving people</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives to not do not do the right </v>

989
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:53.720
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing,</v>

990
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:54.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end,</v>

991
00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 2>the final point is worth making is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

992
00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:57.194
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the kind of person who defends </v>

993
00:41:58.881 --> 00:41:59.714
<v Speaker 2>radical and extreme views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never want to alienate people who </v>

994
00:42:02.451 --> 00:42:03.284
<v Speaker 2>are a little bit less radical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit less extreme in all these </v>

995
00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:06.840
<v Speaker 2>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

996
00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

997
00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I still say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

998
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

999
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.673
<v Speaker 2>if you're very concerned about small </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority of very poor people who really </v>

1000
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:15.020
<v Speaker 2>couldn't afford afford insurance during </v>
<v Speaker 2>this time,</v>

1001
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 2>that aren't fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a government program that,</v>

1002
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:17.880
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1003
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.713
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that subsidize it or provides insurance </v>

1004
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.930
<v Speaker 2>for orphan children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for folio,</v>

1005
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.220
<v Speaker 2>for kids who have terrible diseases for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are very poor but happened to</v>

1006
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.330
<v Speaker 2>be struck by disaster.</v>

1007
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:30.523
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have a program that costs five </v>

1008
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 2>percent as much as what we're currently </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1009
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:34.124
<v Speaker 2>We could ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of 95 percent without really </v>

1010
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:39.710
<v Speaker 2>bumping into any of the complaints that </v>
<v Speaker 2>role people have.</v>

1011
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.813
<v Speaker 2>I'll say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1012
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.320
<v Speaker 2>what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the poor?</v>

1013
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:43.154
<v Speaker 2>What about kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about people that they're </v>

1014
00:42:43.701 --> 00:42:45.740
<v Speaker 2>responsible parents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And still,</v>

1015
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 2>you could go 95 percent of the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the libertarian policy.</v>

1016
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.323
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so know I'm the kind of person who says </v>

1017
00:42:52.401 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 2>what about the last five percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to go and lose people,</v>

1018
00:42:55.131 --> 00:42:58.250
<v Speaker 2>lose people because who were willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go the first 95?</v>

1019
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's worth saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look with health insurance.</v>

1020
00:43:00.681 --> 00:43:01.514
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe we'll see how government </v>

1021
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:04.940
<v Speaker 2>could still subsidize it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1022
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 2>for kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poor parents,</v>

1023
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.110
<v Speaker 2>for people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're born with a,</v>

1024
00:43:09.111 --> 00:43:09.830
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>

1025
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:10.663
<v Speaker 2>with a terrible congenital disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it just make a few exceptions and </v>

1026
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 2>then stop making the exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say like this small area,</v>

1027
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:18.284
<v Speaker 2>this is where it's so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Government's going to pay for it out of </v>

1028
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:22.910
<v Speaker 2>taxpayer money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else though,</v>

1029
00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Saker swim usually all like you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>adult.</v>

1030
00:43:24.711 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 2>You should take care of yourself.</v>

1031
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:26.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Must Bang your head on the wall </v>

1032
00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:28.094
<v Speaker 1>every time people in public demand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government throw more money at </v>

1033
00:43:30.771 --> 00:43:31.251
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1034
00:43:31.251 --> 00:43:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Because this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always the easy answer.</v>

1035
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:36.530
<v Speaker 1>It always see it feels right to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw more money at it,</v>

1036
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:37.883
<v Speaker 1>throw more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially in the thrill and the </v>

1037
00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 1>throwing is a great image because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a lack of accuracy,</v>

1038
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:46.580
<v Speaker 1>lack of lack of interest in actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>targeting any specific</v>

1039
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.950
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1040
00:43:47.951 --> 00:43:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just wrapped up a book on education</v>

1041
00:43:50.171 --> 00:43:54.970
<v Speaker 2>called the case against education where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I argue for defunding education.</v>

1042
00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:56.351
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1043
00:43:56.351 --> 00:43:57.161
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also like,</v>

1044
00:43:57.161 --> 00:43:58.330
<v Speaker 2>isn't that bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1045
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be bad for me.</v>

1046
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.840
<v Speaker 2>People listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still my conscience says this is the</v>

1047
00:44:01.841 --> 00:44:02.530
<v Speaker 2>right thing to do.</v>

1048
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:02.971
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1049
00:44:02.971 --> 00:44:04.780
<v Speaker 1>so sell me on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from,</v>

1050
00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I went to a public elementary school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public junior high public high school.</v>

1051
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I went to State University of New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Binghamton,</v>

1052
00:44:10.361 --> 00:44:12.490
<v Speaker 1>which was hugely subsidized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

1053
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it was around $9,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and I got a great education.</v>

1054
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I.</v>

1055
00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.640
<v Speaker 2>So I went to public schools right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this neighborhood actually.</v>

1056
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1057
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.560
<v Speaker 2>like the heart of my case is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the signaling model of education.</v>

1058
00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:28.893
<v Speaker 2>So you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fancy term for a common sense </v>

1059
00:44:30.741 --> 00:44:31.574
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just says that a lot of the reason why </v>

1060
00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 2>education pays is not that as teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful job skills,</v>

1061
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.020
<v Speaker 2>but rather you're jumping through hoops </v>
<v Speaker 2>to show off for employers.</v>

1062
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just think about all the classes that</v>

1063
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:43.974
<v Speaker 2>you ever had to take and then how few of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them are actually relevant to the job </v>

1064
00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:48.174
<v Speaker 2>that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually probably have a job where </v>

1065
00:44:49.321 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 2>you do use more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

1066
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:51.220
<v Speaker 2>more of what you studied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1067
00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I was a political sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1068
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 2>But yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1069
00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:54.903
<v Speaker 2>thinking about just think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes that were required were you </v>

1070
00:44:57.811 --> 00:44:58.644
<v Speaker 2>would not where you would not have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to graduate without going </v>

1071
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:01.074
<v Speaker 2>through all of them.</v>

1072
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.210
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I always have this example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you're like one aristotle class,</v>

1073
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:08.010
<v Speaker 2>shorter college graduation and yet you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to finish that class.</v>

1074
00:45:08.011 --> 00:45:08.844
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're going to use the </v>

1075
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Nicomachean ethics and on the job </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

1076
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Rather because you want that diploma and</v>
<v Speaker 2>employers are like,</v>

1077
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:16.973
<v Speaker 2>like many employers will just throw your</v>
<v Speaker 2>application right in the trash unless </v>

1078
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:20.184
<v Speaker 2>you have the diploma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you lose something doing it your </v>

1079
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:23.640
<v Speaker 2>way because of just a certain breadth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

1080
00:45:23.641 --> 00:45:24.474
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying that every class </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be mandated and of course they </v>

1081
00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:28.620
<v Speaker 2>stick you in things that shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary,</v>

1082
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.603
<v Speaker 2>but just that in terms of college </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically that that's where you </v>

1083
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:35.970
<v Speaker 2>should get a broad sense of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that be at risk then?</v>

1084
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

1085
00:45:36.991 --> 00:45:38.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not at risk because almost no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets it.</v>

1086
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

1087
00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:41.763
<v Speaker 2>So that is the harsh truth is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just go and look at what graduates of </v>

1088
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 2>the current system.</v>

1089
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is next to nothing.</v>

1090
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there have been some great nationally</v>

1091
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 2>representative surveys of what American </v>
<v Speaker 2>adults know about government,</v>

1092
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 2>about history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about economics,</v>

1093
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.590
<v Speaker 2>and the answer is they know next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1094
00:45:58.830 --> 00:45:59.663
<v Speaker 2>So if you were to defend the system </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that people need breadth of </v>

1095
00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.124
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's not a defense of the current </v>

1096
00:46:03.211 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 2>system because they have this current </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is not giving it to them all.</v>

1097
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.253
<v Speaker 2>The way that I like to think about it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that typical American college graduate </v>

1098
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:12.503
<v Speaker 2>is lucky to maybe answer half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most basic questions you can imagine on </v>

1099
00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:17.760
<v Speaker 2>civics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

1100
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they then they.</v>

1101
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:21.810
<v Speaker 2>That was still worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say it's not worthwhile because what,</v>

1102
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.690
<v Speaker 2>what do you call someone who knows half </v>
<v Speaker 2>their letters?</v>

1103
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:27.640
<v Speaker 2>What do you call someone who knows half </v>
<v Speaker 2>their letters and eating it?</v>

1104
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.570
<v Speaker 2>It literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after letters,</v>

1105
00:46:30.571 --> 00:46:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you are illiterate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>illiterate,</v>

1106
00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.300
<v Speaker 2>even know what have your letters.</v>

1107
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 2>You are illiterate because you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>read similarly saying,</v>

1108
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.490
<v Speaker 2>if you know half the basic facts about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1109
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.070
<v Speaker 2>about us history or about American </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

1110
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.810
<v Speaker 2>you don't know half of what you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1111
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Speaker 2>You just don't know it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a clue,</v>

1112
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.420
<v Speaker 2>if you think there are one and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>branches of government,</v>

1113
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.210
<v Speaker 2>you just don't have a clue about what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1114
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the current system has </v>
<v Speaker 2>given us.</v>

1115
00:46:53.131 --> 00:46:55.740
<v Speaker 2>So when people say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't this be a disaster?</v>

1116
00:46:55.741 --> 00:46:56.460
<v Speaker 2>And say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1117
00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.110
<v Speaker 2>you might say the current system is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster,</v>

1118
00:46:58.111 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm proposing wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

1119
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now there's always the question,</v>

1120
00:47:01.771 --> 00:47:02.604
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why not go and redouble our efforts </v>

1121
00:47:03.721 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 2>so that people really do learn the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1122
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Main thing I'd say is like the resources</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would take are so vast.</v>

1123
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1124
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know of any actual sign that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1125
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it could be done.</v>

1126
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:16.363
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1127
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:17.071
<v Speaker 2>you'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also,</v>

1128
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:17.904
<v Speaker 2>I do have a way cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a alternative to the current system </v>

1129
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 2>for actually getting people to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

1130
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:23.423
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of my most reformers </v>

1131
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:25.940
<v Speaker 2>proposals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it does involve,</v>

1132
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.690
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't involve government money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still,</v>

1133
00:47:27.691 --> 00:47:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I'd say a way use the government money </v>
<v Speaker 2>than what we're doing right now.</v>

1134
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the proposal.</v>

1135
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Every year there is a government test of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your knowledge to civics.</v>

1136
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.410
<v Speaker 2>And if you get a good score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get some money.</v>

1137
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.050
<v Speaker 2>The end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1138
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Now what's the point of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1139
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:42.580
<v Speaker 2>two points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1140
00:47:42.581 --> 00:47:43.414
<v Speaker 2>it gives people an incentive to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn the material by how in whatever </v>

1141
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:50.680
<v Speaker 2>means actually works best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the end you get something.</v>

1142
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angela?</v>

1143
00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1144
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:52.751
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1145
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 2>you could learn it on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just read a book,</v>

1146
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 2>you could learn it in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any possible method of learning.</v>

1147
00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:58.143
<v Speaker 2>The material is equally rewarded so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't go and throw money to high </v>

1148
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.113
<v Speaker 2>school civics teachers who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestly failed to fail to actually </v>

1149
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:06.694
<v Speaker 2>generate a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a knowledgeable public instead of just </v>

1150
00:48:08.591 --> 00:48:09.424
<v Speaker 2>opens it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so say there's a war for knowing </v>

1151
00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However you learn it is fine.</v>

1152
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.833
<v Speaker 2>But the other reason why you do it every</v>
<v Speaker 2>year is because there is enormous </v>

1153
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:16.744
<v Speaker 2>evidence and educational psychology that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people generally forget what they </v>

1154
00:48:19.091 --> 00:48:22.180
<v Speaker 2>learned very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on test day,</v>

1155
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 2>actually I believe that most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>students in this class probably actually</v>

1156
00:48:25.301 --> 00:48:27.980
<v Speaker 2>kind of knew their stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's what,</v>

1157
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.670
<v Speaker 2>what psychologists called fade out is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous.</v>

1158
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Just the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in one year out the next,</v>

1159
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 2>if you don't keep testing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll keep using it.</v>

1160
00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 2>You lose it so you have the test every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1161
00:48:36.971 --> 00:48:37.804
<v Speaker 2>This would actually lead to retention of</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge over time where people would </v>

1162
00:48:40.811 --> 00:48:43.660
<v Speaker 2>not immediately forget the material as </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as they learn it because like wow,</v>

1163
00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:45.130
<v Speaker 2>I need to know what next year and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year after that,</v>

1164
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:45.964
<v Speaker 2>every year I can get another hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks off of showing that I know my </v>

1165
00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:49.474
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1166
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:50.670
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no,</v>

1167
00:48:50.671 --> 00:48:52.360
<v Speaker 2>you don't think there's a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prioritize that then.</v>

1168
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.320
<v Speaker 2>So you can do with charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

1169
00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 2>this is legal and no charity has done it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for so I'm not too optimistic about that</v>

1170
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:00.620
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1171
00:49:00.621 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 2>like if some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some donor right now is interested in</v>

1172
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:04.840
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this would be great.</v>

1173
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:07.930
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will be so much cheaper than high.</v>

1174
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Then all the high school social sciences</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes that we offer right now,</v>

1175
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:13.083
<v Speaker 2>whatever you bros will ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people often start freaking out who's </v>

1176
00:49:14.111 --> 00:49:15.730
<v Speaker 2>going to write the test?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

1177
00:49:15.731 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 2>well look right now a key part of civics</v>
<v Speaker 2>is knowing the answers the teacher wants</v>

1178
00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:20.644
<v Speaker 2>to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like even like as long as you know </v>

1179
00:49:23.231 --> 00:49:26.230
<v Speaker 2>that there's a certain bias on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the official civics test,</v>

1180
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 2>you just vacate and like in order to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>well and it,</v>

1181
00:49:29.111 --> 00:49:30.520
<v Speaker 2>you still have to learn a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1182
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:31.354
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had so many college classes </v>

1183
00:49:33.071 --> 00:49:35.440
<v Speaker 2>where I disagreed with the professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still learn,</v>

1184
00:49:35.441 --> 00:49:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I learned what the answer is they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hear,</v>

1185
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:38.343
<v Speaker 2>but I also learned the material the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and there's no reason why you </v>

1186
00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:43.310
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do apply the same thing.</v>

1187
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:45.950
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that it's really such a.</v>

1188
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Such a terrible deal.</v>

1189
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:48.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see the fadeout rate for </v>

1190
00:49:49.601 --> 00:49:50.434
<v Speaker 1>kids the day after the sats because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember studying for that thing and go </v>

1191
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:57.070
<v Speaker 1>united tutor with a group of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember thinking,</v>

1192
00:49:57.071 --> 00:49:58.510
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm done with this thing,</v>

1193
00:49:58.511 --> 00:50:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I am going to let go of all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had taken the test probably a week</v>

1194
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.300
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1195
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably to have the scores on that.</v>

1196
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting research in psychology.</v>

1197
00:50:07.581 --> 00:50:12.020
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of research on fade out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in school where you go and you teach the</v>

1198
00:50:12.021 --> 00:50:12.854
<v Speaker 2>kids something and then you go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure it one or two years later in </v>

1199
00:50:14.631 --> 00:50:16.990
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the really scary,</v>

1200
00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.750
<v Speaker 2>really scary fade out is from school to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adulthood because of the kids in school.</v>

1201
00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.520
<v Speaker 2>At least they kind of know I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to learn this again.</v>

1202
00:50:22.521 --> 00:50:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I might get tested on again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once you finally graduate,</v>

1203
00:50:24.891 --> 00:50:26.000
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the end.</v>

1204
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.253
<v Speaker 2>So there's a fantastic study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a retention of higher mathematics </v>

1205
00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:33.380
<v Speaker 2>throughout life and like Algebra and </v>
<v Speaker 2>geometry,</v>

1206
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 2>like were they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Within a couple of decades,</v>

1207
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:36.164
<v Speaker 2>most people took those classes just know</v>
<v Speaker 2>or back to where they were before they </v>

1208
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:39.104
<v Speaker 2>even actually started the classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only people remember their Algebra </v>

1209
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:42.704
<v Speaker 2>and geometry are people who go all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way up to calculus to go all the way to </v>

1210
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

1211
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Then you go and retain Algebra and </v>
<v Speaker 2>geometry for the rest of your life,</v>

1212
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:54.060
<v Speaker 2>but you have to go way beyond a subject </v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually retain the,</v>

1213
00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.680
<v Speaker 2>retain the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any of that.</v>

1214
00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.100
<v Speaker 2>This all fits with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1215
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 2>like say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like use it or lose it or a tiger mom.</v>

1216
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Amy Chu has a great slogan like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday,</v>

1217
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.080
<v Speaker 2>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday you don't practice as a day you</v>

1218
00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:07.810
<v Speaker 2>get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1219
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.050
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this does go with well.</v>

1220
00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:11.810
<v Speaker 2>So why bother teaching people things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to forget.</v>

1221
00:51:11.811 --> 00:51:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean this,</v>

1222
00:51:13.331 --> 00:51:14.164
<v Speaker 2>this is part of my critique of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's wrong with throwing so much </v>

1223
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:17.804
<v Speaker 2>money at education?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to say we'll get like now of </v>

1224
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:24.120
<v Speaker 2>course none of this denies that schools </v>
<v Speaker 2>do teach them useful material but again,</v>

1225
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 2>my view is already again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like for the useful material,</v>

1226
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:28.484
<v Speaker 2>like you're like most people can pay for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably like most people's parents </v>

1227
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:33.320
<v Speaker 2>can pay for it and then if there's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be any role for government,</v>

1228
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:34.154
<v Speaker 2>let it be for the small minority of kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose parents are not able to take care </v>

1229
00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:38.150
<v Speaker 2>of them or shared.</v>

1230
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.983
<v Speaker 2>He's not taking care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for just that last sliver of </v>

1231
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:41.924
<v Speaker 2>people let you know they don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a role for </v>

1232
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:44.270
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it be that.</v>

1233
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 2>So don't throw money at a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be money,</v>

1234
00:51:46.731 --> 00:51:47.564
<v Speaker 2>let it be narrowly targeted to give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be mindful that you are taking money </v>

1235
00:51:52.491 --> 00:51:53.324
<v Speaker 2>from taxpayers without their consent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>at minimum you owe them responsibility </v>

1236
00:51:56.361 --> 00:51:57.290
<v Speaker 2>to spend the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1237
00:51:57.291 --> 00:51:59.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that's seems like a really basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1238
00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.730
<v Speaker 2>I think we've given up that that minimum</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time.</v>

1239
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even like,</v>

1240
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:04.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's one thing to say,</v>

1241
00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:05.680
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so important that we're going to</v>

1242
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:08.450
<v Speaker 2>that where that you have to pay whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you like it or not too bad,</v>

1243
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:11.180
<v Speaker 2>but then go and spend that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Leslie,</v>

1244
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:15.320
<v Speaker 2>that seems like it's really a true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like honestly,</v>

1245
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.440
<v Speaker 2>like that seems like a true human rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse.</v>

1246
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:21.410
<v Speaker 2>To take someone for money at gunpoint </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just blow it.</v>

1247
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Like without saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe this will do something.</v>

1248
00:52:24.091 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if that's your attitude,</v>

1249
00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:28.610
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't have taken my money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be like,</v>

1250
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.340
<v Speaker 2>maybe you should have asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't have made me if that's</v>

1251
00:52:31.341 --> 00:52:32.270
<v Speaker 2>all you've got.</v>

1252
00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.680
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's shift slightly from economics.</v>

1253
00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:36.401
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1254
00:52:36.401 --> 00:52:37.234
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you that I think most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my audience I think is classically </v>

1255
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:42.340
<v Speaker 1>liberal or Libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is the,</v>

1256
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.273
<v Speaker 1>is the big chunk of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think they're going to be with you </v>

1257
00:52:44.471 --> 00:52:45.304
<v Speaker 1>on a lot of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get to some stuff that I think </v>

1258
00:52:46.391 --> 00:52:47.224
<v Speaker 1>that they may not be with you as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about borders and </v>

1259
00:52:49.961 --> 00:52:50.794
<v Speaker 1>immigration for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are for a couple minutes at least a </v>

1260
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.910
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An open borders guy.</v>

1261
00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

1262
00:52:55.841 --> 00:52:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with everything going on in the world</v>

1263
00:52:58.691 --> 00:52:59.524
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me your best pitch for open </v>

1264
00:53:00.491 --> 00:53:02.050
<v Speaker 1>borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I am not.</v>

1265
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:03.280
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let everything go.</v>

1266
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know</v>

1267
00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.253
<v Speaker 2>y'all going on in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first step is to say the stuff you </v>

1268
00:53:06.751 --> 00:53:09.920
<v Speaker 2>see on the news is so statistically rare</v>
<v Speaker 2>that no sensible person would even worry</v>

1269
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:10.790
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very much.</v>

1270
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:13.970
<v Speaker 2>So like terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on the news all the time,</v>

1271
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 2>it is one of the smallest problems on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>

1272
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:17.653
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you just go in and look at the </v>

1273
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:20.380
<v Speaker 2>data and you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you will see alright,</v>

1274
00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.253
<v Speaker 2>so deaths from murder is like under one </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of all deaths and terrorist </v>

1275
00:53:26.971 --> 00:53:28.950
<v Speaker 2>murders under one percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>murders.</v>

1276
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:30.023
<v Speaker 2>So why is it that people are so worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and we have spent over a </v>

1277
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:35.423
<v Speaker 2>trillion dollars in the war on terror </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it has vivid because it is </v>

1278
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:38.274
<v Speaker 2>emotionally effecting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd say like the first thing that we </v>

1279
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:45.381
<v Speaker 2>have to do is calm down and apply </v>
<v Speaker 2>numeracy and just like say like here's a</v>

1280
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's worried about it.</v>

1281
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Is it really a serious problem that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be concerned about or not?</v>

1282
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1283
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I say like terrorism is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

1284
00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.680
<v Speaker 2>the strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most emotional critique.</v>

1285
00:53:55.681 --> 00:53:59.700
<v Speaker 2>People have immigration and yet it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not actually a sensible thing to be able</v>

1286
00:53:59.701 --> 00:54:00.534
<v Speaker 2>to be worried about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how much and how much of it is </v>

1287
00:54:02.191 --> 00:54:03.024
<v Speaker 2>because what we're doing is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>working so that we know we're keeping a </v>

1288
00:54:06.451 --> 00:54:07.284
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of people would love to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in here and blow things up and </v>

1289
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'd say is there's,</v>

1290
00:54:11.101 --> 00:54:11.934
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of ways that we could go </v>

1291
00:54:12.571 --> 00:54:13.790
<v Speaker 2>and test whether the stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1292
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:14.280
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1293
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.660
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have is working.</v>

1294
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>

1295
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.900
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great political scientist,</v>

1296
00:54:18.901 --> 00:54:21.510
<v Speaker 2>John Mueller as a book called overblown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going over all of it.</v>

1297
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:22.643
<v Speaker 2>So one thing we can do is just look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>where called near misses so you can go </v>

1298
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:26.330
<v Speaker 2>and see you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1299
00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Like how many terrorist thoughts are </v>
<v Speaker 2>that failed,</v>

1300
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:30.420
<v Speaker 2>which gives us an idea how fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much is they go,</v>

1301
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:32.070
<v Speaker 2>what we're currently doing actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

1302
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:34.080
<v Speaker 2>So like the shoe bomber for things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1303
00:54:34.081 --> 00:54:34.914
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go and expand the sample to </v>

1304
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:37.861
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all,</v>

1305
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 2>to all the failed cases and especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go and look carefully,</v>

1306
00:54:40.951 --> 00:54:41.784
<v Speaker 2>not just the things that the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>classifies as terrorism so they can go </v>

1307
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 2>and get a photo op.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But things that actually when you really</v>

1308
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 2>look at was an actual terrorist plots </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they had gotten,</v>

1309
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:50.893
<v Speaker 2>where they had done something more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>say we should have a terrorist plots </v>

1310
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.470
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is still.</v>

1311
00:54:54.471 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 2>It still remains incredibly rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now another test,</v>

1312
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:58.134
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was actually one of my favorite </v>

1313
00:54:58.441 --> 00:54:59.274
<v Speaker 2>ones is for all the people think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy to get into Mexico </v>

1314
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.740
<v Speaker 2>should mean that it's really easy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists to get in from Mexico.</v>

1315
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.700
<v Speaker 2>And yet the actual number that had done </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exceeded extremely small.</v>

1316
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:09.923
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in like,</v>

1317
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:12.270
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure there's been any case of,</v>

1318
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:14.100
<v Speaker 2>of any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of any terrorists coming,</v>

1319
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross crossing,</v>

1320
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.720
<v Speaker 2>crossing from Mexico and doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1321
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:18.041
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1322
00:55:18.041 --> 00:55:18.874
<v Speaker 2>so if you were someone who thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the border is port is poorly guarded </v>

1323
00:55:20.751 --> 00:55:21.584
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it doesn't make a lot of sense to </v>

1324
00:55:23.401 --> 00:55:24.234
<v Speaker 2>think that current anti terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies are preventing a lot just </v>

1325
00:55:26.131 --> 00:55:28.350
<v Speaker 2>because it's so easy for them to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1326
00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that our actually our,</v>

1327
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:31.110
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1328
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.400
<v Speaker 2>our borders guarded very well in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that people pay about five,</v>

1329
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 2>about $4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get smuggled across.</v>

1330
00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:37.623
<v Speaker 2>So for the kind of people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are smuggling or who are coming </v>

1331
00:55:39.361 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 2>across the border that several years </v>
<v Speaker 2>income,</v>

1332
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.780
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1333
00:55:42.781 --> 00:55:44.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal for a rural Mexican farm</v>

1334
00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:45.294
<v Speaker 2>worker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a big deal for a serious </v>

1335
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:47.240
<v Speaker 2>terrorist.</v>

1336
00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.130
<v Speaker 2>You're serious terrorist and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with 5,000</v>

1337
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:52.050
<v Speaker 2>bucks for your plot and then like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're a joke.</v>

1338
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:52.881
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1339
00:55:52.881 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the idea that there,</v>

1340
00:55:57.241 --> 00:55:58.074
<v Speaker 2>that there really is a serious problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>or that we have done much about it as I </v>

1341
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:01.650
<v Speaker 2>think just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1342
00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.870
<v Speaker 2>this is like they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1343
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.880
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be going to settle again,</v>

1344
00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:06.780
<v Speaker 2>the stuff on the news and stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people really care about now.</v>

1345
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:08.970
<v Speaker 2>What is the case in favor of open </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders?</v>

1346
00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.413
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the kind of thing that you almost </v>

1347
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:12.570
<v Speaker 2>never see on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1348
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.470
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean there,</v>

1349
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:16.390
<v Speaker 2>there's the others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economic case and,</v>

1350
00:56:16.391 --> 00:56:17.720
<v Speaker 2>and the human rights case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1351
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.700
<v Speaker 2>like the economic case is very simple to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just says that the most,</v>

1352
00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 2>all the very best way that we know of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1353
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:26.363
<v Speaker 2>of you increase in the production of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind is to move people from poor </v>

1354
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 2>countries to rich countries.</v>

1355
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1356
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:34.450
<v Speaker 2>it is almost like magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take a Haitian was making a dollar a</v>

1357
00:56:34.451 --> 00:56:38.080
<v Speaker 2>day and port-au-prince moved to Miami </v>
<v Speaker 2>and suddenly he's making $40 a day.</v>

1358
00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

1359
00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:42.850
<v Speaker 2>his productivity increases by a factor </v>
<v Speaker 2>of 40 and you're like,</v>

1360
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 2>how is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1361
00:56:44.561 --> 00:56:45.394
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'd probably doesn't even speak </v>

1362
00:56:45.911 --> 00:56:48.000
<v Speaker 2>English at first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He speaks French and the,</v>

1363
00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:48.883
<v Speaker 2>the answer is his Labor is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unproductive and Haiti and extremely </v>

1364
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:52.264
<v Speaker 2>productive in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even very unskilled workers produce far </v>

1365
00:56:55.151 --> 00:56:57.160
<v Speaker 2>more in rich countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do in poorer countries,</v>

1366
00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:59.230
<v Speaker 2>poor countries are screwed up in so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

1367
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.860
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1368
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the most amazing things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do about poverty is to move</v>

1369
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 2>people from poor countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich countries.</v>

1370
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:07.114
<v Speaker 2>Then overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they can accomplish multiplies and </v>

1371
00:57:09.191 --> 00:57:12.760
<v Speaker 2>not by like 10 percent or 20 percent by </v>
<v Speaker 2>five times,</v>

1372
00:57:12.761 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 2>10 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 times.</v>

1373
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 2>It is amazing and of course radiology </v>
<v Speaker 2>know if you understand the basic trade,</v>

1374
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:20.470
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't just benefit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants,</v>

1375
00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:23.140
<v Speaker 2>it benefits everyone who's consuming </v>
<v Speaker 2>that product,</v>

1376
00:57:23.141 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 2>so the benefit benefits all of the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the immigrants make mead right now,</v>

1377
00:57:26.831 --> 00:57:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Haiti is pretty much irrelevant to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>global economy.</v>

1378
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.150
<v Speaker 2>If you were to move those Haitians to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>

1379
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.820
<v Speaker 2>suddenly the global economy would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard by a very large amounts and in a</v>

1380
00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:38.740
<v Speaker 2>lot of the actual production will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed not just by the Haitians,</v>

1381
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:41.110
<v Speaker 2>but it would be consumed by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1382
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:41.973
<v Speaker 2>by the people that are eating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Haitian restaurants by the people that </v>

1383
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:46.210
<v Speaker 2>are hiring Haitian nannies or rh </v>
<v Speaker 2>variation gardeners.</v>

1384
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.253
<v Speaker 2>All these things that right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>currently are not happening now when </v>

1385
00:57:49.631 --> 00:57:51.310
<v Speaker 2>economists have just tried to get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimate,</v>

1386
00:57:51.311 --> 00:57:52.144
<v Speaker 2>like how much are we losing from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>border restrictions from trapping all </v>

1387
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 2>this valuable labor in poor countries.</v>

1388
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pretty good estimate is that we are,</v>

1389
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.810
<v Speaker 2>is that immigration restrictions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>having the,</v>

1390
00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:03.673
<v Speaker 2>the production of the world we would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the world will be twice as rich if </v>

1391
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:08.344
<v Speaker 2>anyone could take a job anywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>again it's things like what could you </v>

1392
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:12.250
<v Speaker 2>accomplish in Haiti?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are actually,</v>

1393
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to have to reset up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the revenue a hell of a show in Haiti,</v>

1394
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:18.950
<v Speaker 2>although you'd have trouble getting your</v>
<v Speaker 2>guests so,</v>

1395
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:20.990
<v Speaker 2>so cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could find.</v>

1396
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I said it will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general,</v>

1397
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:27.340
<v Speaker 2>most people when you picture what could </v>
<v Speaker 2>I do in Haiti,</v>

1398
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:28.174
<v Speaker 2>it's very little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the main difference between a </v>

1399
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:31.571
<v Speaker 2>you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1400
00:58:31.571 --> 00:58:32.404
<v Speaker 2>so between Haitians and Americans is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Haitians are stuck in Haiti and </v>

1401
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:36.424
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's true that their skills are low </v>

1402
00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:38.464
<v Speaker 2>by American standards spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do so much more here than they </v>

1403
00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:41.430
<v Speaker 2>couldn't come.</v>

1404
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:42.610
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do back at home.</v>

1405
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:43.833
<v Speaker 2>So what now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does act when people say open </v>

1406
00:58:45.701 --> 00:58:47.410
<v Speaker 2>borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that actually mean?</v>

1407
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 2>You mean that could people just wander </v>
<v Speaker 2>in from Canada and Mexico?</v>

1408
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Are we shutting down the places that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they walked through?</v>

1409
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.840
<v Speaker 2>So I would say that means that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>call that no borders.</v>

1410
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be willing to defend that too.</v>

1411
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:01.653
<v Speaker 2>But that's not my main pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My main pitch is open borders where the </v>

1412
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:07.540
<v Speaker 2>way I think about it is if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless someone belongs in jail,</v>

1413
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.310
<v Speaker 2>he can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can move to any country wants.</v>

1414
00:59:09.311 --> 00:59:12.340
<v Speaker 2>He lived there and he can work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So unless blood.</v>

1415
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.250
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you.</v>

1416
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a Canadian,</v>

1417
00:59:14.471 --> 00:59:15.304
<v Speaker 2>you want to come to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you walk through the sanction </v>

1418
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.633
<v Speaker 2>border,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you said you might </v>

1419
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:19.263
<v Speaker 2>potentially but the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you walk through how you are you a </v>

1420
00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.730
<v Speaker 2>citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew they would get,</v>

1421
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can live there,</v>

1422
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 2>you can work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make.</v>

1423
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:25.970
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you a citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1424
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.073
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you're never miss out again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like to me the heart of under </v>

1425
00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:29.723
<v Speaker 2>orders isn't citizenship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the right to live the right to end </v>

1426
00:59:31.661 --> 00:59:33.590
<v Speaker 2>the and the right to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1427
00:59:33.591 --> 00:59:34.221
<v Speaker 2>Which of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1428
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:34.660
<v Speaker 2>you do this</v>

1429
00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.790
<v Speaker 1>for an unlimited amount of time because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then in effect,</v>

1430
00:59:36.791 --> 00:59:39.970
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to get all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights of a citizen at some point.</v>

1431
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might.</v>

1432
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:41.311
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1433
00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:41.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1434
00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against that,</v>

1435
00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.820
<v Speaker 2>but to get that is not to yell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1436
00:59:44.821 --> 00:59:46.880
<v Speaker 2>but I also not strongly for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1437
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.320
<v Speaker 2>what I'm strongly for is the right of </v>
<v Speaker 2>any human being.</v>

1438
00:59:49.321 --> 00:59:52.200
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't belong in jail to live and </v>
<v Speaker 2>work in any country that he wants.</v>

1439
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.910
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already mentioned the economic case.</v>

1440
00:59:53.911 --> 00:59:54.744
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you need the human rights case is </v>

1441
00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.500
<v Speaker 2>basically what it look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This though,</v>

1442
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:58.800
<v Speaker 2>this is a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants,</v>

1443
00:59:58.801 --> 01:00:01.440
<v Speaker 2>sells like there's someone who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rent them an apartment right here.</v>

1444
01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:03.270
<v Speaker 2>There's someone who wants to hire him </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1445
01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.700
<v Speaker 2>What business is any stranger f saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1446
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.500
<v Speaker 2>So maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know.</v>

1447
01:00:07.501 --> 01:00:08.610
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1448
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.473
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1449
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.820
<v Speaker 2>I've compared immigration laws to Jim </v>
<v Speaker 2>crow laws.</v>

1450
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I said the main difference is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration laws are worse.</v>

1451
01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:15.563
<v Speaker 2>Jim Crow Law said that there are some </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas where blacks couldn't live in the </v>

1452
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:19.090
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

1453
01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:20.820
<v Speaker 2>There are some jobs blacks couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>

1454
01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:23.820
<v Speaker 2>What our immigration law say is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a Mexican citizen,</v>

1455
01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:24.863
<v Speaker 2>there is no place in the country you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>legally live and no job in the country </v>

1456
01:00:28.141 --> 01:00:29.850
<v Speaker 2>you can legally work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1457
01:00:29.851 --> 01:00:32.070
<v Speaker 2>That seems way worse than Jim Crow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1458
01:00:32.071 --> 01:00:33.220
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it will be,</v>

1459
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.100
<v Speaker 2>will you have to become a citizen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then uk?</v>

1460
01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:35.963
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1461
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.340
<v Speaker 2>but the only citizen is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible for someone,</v>

1462
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:39.690
<v Speaker 2>for someone who's worn a Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen,</v>

1463
01:00:39.691 --> 01:00:41.400
<v Speaker 2>unless of course you have a close blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>relative,</v>

1464
01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:42.863
<v Speaker 2>you are generally out of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sort of the idea of why don't </v>

1465
01:00:44.521 --> 01:00:45.354
<v Speaker 2>they just go and get in line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer is for most people on earth </v>

1466
01:00:47.521 --> 01:00:50.070
<v Speaker 2>and want to come the line last hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of years,</v>

1467
01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:54.300
<v Speaker 2>they could never legally come like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions for legal immigration.</v>

1468
01:00:54.301 --> 01:00:56.640
<v Speaker 2>So they really all four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are a low skill worker,</v>

1469
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:57.743
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much limited to having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood relative already the US or </v>

1470
01:01:00.541 --> 01:01:02.190
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1471
01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1472
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple other way on,</v>

1473
01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:06.780
<v Speaker 2>a couple of other ways of doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those are extraordinarily rare.</v>

1474
01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:09.240
<v Speaker 2>So for most people in Third World Right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1475
01:01:09.241 --> 01:01:10.074
<v Speaker 2>there is no possibility they'll ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will ever be admitted no matter </v>

1476
01:01:12.181 --> 01:01:13.440
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1477
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:14.640
<v Speaker 2>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like,</v>

1478
01:01:14.641 --> 01:01:15.474
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that because the person chose </v>

1479
01:01:17.311 --> 01:01:19.230
<v Speaker 2>the wrong parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were born in the wrong country,</v>

1480
01:01:19.231 --> 01:01:20.064
<v Speaker 2>that they have to be stuck living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Haiti their whole life and he and you </v>

1481
01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:23.693
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people can very easily see the </v>

1482
01:01:24.421 --> 01:01:26.340
<v Speaker 2>injustice saying because someone is born</v>
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

1483
01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:29.970
<v Speaker 2>you are stuck living in black areas of </v>
<v Speaker 2>black areas of the United States and you</v>

1484
01:01:29.971 --> 01:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>can only be a janitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only go and,</v>

1485
01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:34.120
<v Speaker 2>and we're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1486
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.540
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only work as a porter on a train</v>

1487
01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:38.310
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1488
01:01:38.311 --> 01:01:39.144
<v Speaker 2>why is it that he has to be treated </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently just because he chose the </v>

1489
01:01:41.071 --> 01:01:43.070
<v Speaker 2>wrong parents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me this,</v>

1490
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.100
<v Speaker 2>this argument is a very powerful one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And St.</v>

1491
01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:46.043
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that different from choosing to </v>

1492
01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:48.660
<v Speaker 2>have Haitian parents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1493
01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:49.494
<v Speaker 2>the point is no one chooses parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just be all yell like it's </v>

1494
01:01:51.361 --> 01:01:52.800
<v Speaker 2>something that had happened before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were born.</v>

1495
01:01:52.801 --> 01:01:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can go and find a way,</v>

1496
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.403
<v Speaker 2>a will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a willing landlord find a willing </v>

1497
01:01:58.741 --> 01:01:59.574
<v Speaker 2>employer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't you say yes to those jobs and </v>

1498
01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.130
<v Speaker 2>come and live here and work here we are.</v>

1499
01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>So would there be an inherent problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if,</v>

1500
01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.793
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let all these people in now they're </v>

1501
01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>not citizens per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't have the right to vote,</v>

1502
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.800
<v Speaker 1>but they're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using our economy,</v>

1503
01:02:11.801 --> 01:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>they're contributing to our economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

1504
01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.373
<v Speaker 1>All the good stuff that you said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually we could get a situation </v>

1505
01:02:17.021 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>where you might have parody of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of people</v>

1506
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.113
<v Speaker 2>that are voting and the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>living here that seems like it could </v>

1507
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 2>become a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1508
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:26.363
<v Speaker 2>So I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's not clear why they are </v>

1509
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:31.230
<v Speaker 2>not clear why that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and like one of the main things about</v>

1510
01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:32.910
<v Speaker 2>immigrants as they tend to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>

1511
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:36.540
<v Speaker 2>So when you moved to a new country </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally like your concerns are,</v>

1512
01:02:36.541 --> 01:02:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I got to find a good place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta go,</v>

1513
01:02:38.301 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 2>I gotta go and get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of my kids,</v>

1514
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:44.160
<v Speaker 2>and getting involved in the politics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country is usually the last thing on</v>

1515
01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:45.350
<v Speaker 2>people's minds when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they first,</v>

1516
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:46.223
<v Speaker 2>when they first come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the strangest complaints </v>

1517
01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:50.060
<v Speaker 2>about immigrants to me is that they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>

1518
01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.000
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low voting rates and I say,</v>

1519
01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:52.750
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1520
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some.</v>

1521
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:54.143
<v Speaker 2>I think I've heard people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first they got the wrong way and </v>

1522
01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 2>second of all they don't vote.</v>

1523
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like you pick one of the complaints</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>

1524
01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:03.540
<v Speaker 2>So I'm yelling in terms of what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what their kids will do.</v>

1525
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:05.700
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on your under current US law,</v>

1526
01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:07.110
<v Speaker 2>there's birthright citizenship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their kid,</v>

1527
01:03:07.111 --> 01:03:09.150
<v Speaker 2>their kids would be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say there is.</v>

1528
01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:13.710
<v Speaker 2>United States has a long tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilating the children of immigrants.</v>

1529
01:03:13.711 --> 01:03:14.131
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1530
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 2>it's worked very well for a rev American</v>
<v Speaker 2>history and people often think,</v>

1531
01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:19.524
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it worked back then back when we really </v>

1532
01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:22.620
<v Speaker 2>tried to assimilate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work anymore.</v>

1533
01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Where I can say is for the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we measure,</v>

1534
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:29.220
<v Speaker 2>things are the things are as good now as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were in the Ellis island days.</v>

1535
01:03:29.221 --> 01:03:31.170
<v Speaker 2>So especially for light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for language competence,</v>

1536
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:32.423
<v Speaker 2>it was never through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have something special here in </v>

1537
01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:36.120
<v Speaker 2>America that they don't have in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1538
01:03:36.121 --> 01:03:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you there.</v>

1539
01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:38.763
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of evidence of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people still do assimilate more </v>

1540
01:03:41.821 --> 01:03:42.654
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where Europe is having a problem </v>

1541
01:03:43.891 --> 01:03:44.724
<v Speaker 2>with assimilation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a culture problem and that's </v>

1542
01:03:46.381 --> 01:03:47.214
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1543
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two things.</v>

1544
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:49.523
<v Speaker 2>First thing is I'd say that a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems that people talk about are </v>

1545
01:03:52.021 --> 01:03:52.854
<v Speaker 2>primarily problems on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an enormous amount of </v>

1546
01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:57.600
<v Speaker 2>simulation simulation going in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not TV.</v>

1547
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't go and have a TV show saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1548
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:01.343
<v Speaker 2>enormous number of Pakistanis now like </v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer and root for Manchester United </v>

1549
01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 2>and speak with British accents and had </v>
<v Speaker 2>British jobs and do regular stuff.</v>

1550
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.473
<v Speaker 2>That's not a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you'll hear is here's a </v>

1551
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:12.534
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood is a no go area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where were the regular British police </v>

1552
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:17.790
<v Speaker 2>dare not travel for fear of what might </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to them.</v>

1553
01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Sharia law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kid,</v>

1554
01:04:18.911 --> 01:04:19.744
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on at any moment the seminar might </v>

1555
01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:21.360
<v Speaker 2>come out.</v>

1556
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1557
01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:27.510
<v Speaker 2>So first step is always to separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary stories from Cisco reality.</v>

1558
01:04:27.511 --> 01:04:30.870
<v Speaker 2>And what I say is it is true that Europe</v>
<v Speaker 2>does a worse job of getting assimilation</v>

1559
01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.080
<v Speaker 2>of the US.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still have a lot of assimilation.</v>

1560
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:34.740
<v Speaker 2>I remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the last time I was in Paris,</v>

1561
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:35.803
<v Speaker 2>I was just amazed at all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation that I saw at his work and </v>

1562
01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.050
<v Speaker 2>walking downtown and seeing people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the world,</v>

1563
01:04:40.051 --> 01:04:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but they're looking and acting French </v>
<v Speaker 2>now they,</v>

1564
01:04:41.981 --> 01:04:44.040
<v Speaker 2>they're smoking cigarettes in a French </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1565
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.060
<v Speaker 2>It was like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's drinking.</v>

1566
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:48.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like wow,</v>

1567
01:04:48.631 --> 01:04:50.910
<v Speaker 2>that guy looks like he's from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1568
01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:53.160
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Chad or something like that.</v>

1569
01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:54.100
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

1570
01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has like the turtle neck.</v>

1571
01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:55.741
<v Speaker 2>So I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1572
01:04:55.741 --> 01:04:58.490
<v Speaker 2>like you actually see a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilation on.</v>

1573
01:04:58.491 --> 01:04:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was truly have blessing simulation.</v>

1574
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:01.670
<v Speaker 2>But they're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying like,</v>

1575
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:02.543
<v Speaker 2>is there something special that we have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's nothing special we have is a </v>

1576
01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:07.800
<v Speaker 2>more restrictive welfare states so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1577
01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.070
<v Speaker 2>so Europeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1578
01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.220
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it varies a lot by country.</v>

1579
01:05:10.221 --> 01:05:11.880
<v Speaker 2>It's important important to it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that.</v>

1580
01:05:11.881 --> 01:05:12.714
<v Speaker 2>But you're being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry's in general do have much more </v>

1581
01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:15.564
<v Speaker 2>expensive welfare states especially to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it easier be on welfare for your </v>

1582
01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:18.850
<v Speaker 2>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1583
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:19.953
<v Speaker 2>And I think this does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this does great harm to their </v>

1584
01:05:21.741 --> 01:05:22.574
<v Speaker 2>assimilation because one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways of assimilating is to go to a job </v>

1585
01:05:25.841 --> 01:05:29.020
<v Speaker 2>and to go in or interact from Po with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't from your culture.</v>

1586
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you know,</v>

1587
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:32.500
<v Speaker 2>of course a lot of the workers won't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>even if all the workers,</v>

1588
01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:33.770
<v Speaker 2>if you go in and work in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1589
01:05:33.771 --> 01:05:34.604
<v Speaker 2>in a chatty and restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even then a lot of your customers won't </v>

1590
01:05:36.521 --> 01:05:37.150
<v Speaker 2>be from Chad.</v>

1591
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:39.340
<v Speaker 2>And so you will get to know them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll interact with them.</v>

1592
01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Of course you need to go and let you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn the language.</v>

1593
01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:42.424
<v Speaker 2>But also you get to know people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is the kind of assimilation </v>

1594
01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:48.370
<v Speaker 2>that has been greatly undermined by </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1595
01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:50.000
<v Speaker 2>by European welfare states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1596
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.270
<v Speaker 2>it's important to realize that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually two kinds of things going on.</v>

1597
01:05:52.271 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 2>One of them is a lot of free government </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1598
01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Another one is labor market regulations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that raised the price of labor that make</v>

1599
01:05:58.361 --> 01:06:00.970
<v Speaker 2>it hard to get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he put those two things together.</v>

1600
01:06:00.971 --> 01:06:01.804
<v Speaker 2>That's when you have a recipe for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>living their whole living their life on </v>

1601
01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:05.381
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1602
01:06:05.381 --> 01:06:06.340
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd say,</v>

1603
01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:08.560
<v Speaker 2>well maybe they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might like to get a job,</v>

1604
01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:09.394
<v Speaker 2>but if it's really hard to get a job </v>
<v Speaker 2>because regulation and you get enough </v>

1605
01:06:11.981 --> 01:06:14.980
<v Speaker 2>money to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where you are likely to say,</v>

1606
01:06:14.981 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw it.</v>

1607
01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:16.714
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to go and live in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ghetto and I won't and I'll never even </v>

1608
01:06:19.151 --> 01:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>learned French and it's going to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and I'm going to be bitter.</v>

1609
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.300
<v Speaker 1>So people think that those things are at</v>
<v Speaker 1>odds with each other.</v>

1610
01:06:24.301 --> 01:06:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Open borders and a welfare state in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1611
01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.140
<v Speaker 1>But basically you're saying if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1612
01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:32.130
<v Speaker 1>if you open the border and you took away</v>
<v Speaker 1>the welfare state at the same time,</v>

1613
01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.150
<v Speaker 2>you actually forced assimilation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1614
01:06:35.151 --> 01:06:35.511
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1615
01:06:35.511 --> 01:06:39.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're not literally forced to create</v>

1616
01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:40.670
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the current system,</v>

1617
01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.730
<v Speaker 2>especially in Europe has heavily </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidizing not assimilation.</v>

1618
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:45.103
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a mistake and you </v>

1619
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:46.834
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a case where people so </v>

1620
01:06:48.111 --> 01:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>naturally scapegoat immigrants for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem when you didn't say,</v>

1621
01:06:52.881 --> 01:06:53.714
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have some really crummy laws which </v>

1622
01:06:55.161 --> 01:06:57.620
<v Speaker 2>actually would lead soil a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go.</v>

1623
01:06:57.621 --> 01:06:58.454
<v Speaker 2>And of course plenty of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>native born free France who go about </v>

1624
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.940
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1625
01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.880
<v Speaker 2>have their ancestors were galls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1626
01:07:04.881 --> 01:07:05.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of people like this are also in </v>

1627
01:07:06.621 --> 01:07:10.160
<v Speaker 2>France sitting around being supported by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the welfare state for their entire life.</v>

1628
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.151
<v Speaker 2>Which again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1629
01:07:11.151 --> 01:07:12.350
<v Speaker 2>so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

1630
01:07:12.351 --> 01:07:13.184
<v Speaker 2>it's not just people being lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also being very discouraged that </v>

1631
01:07:16.461 --> 01:07:18.290
<v Speaker 2>the regulations make it so hard to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

1632
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1633
01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I get your point a about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1634
01:07:23.531 --> 01:07:24.364
<v Speaker 1>forcing once people are here and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them on this and then they're sort </v>

1635
01:07:27.371 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 1>of stuck in that creates resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then people in present them for that and</v>

1636
01:07:30.761 --> 01:07:32.260
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1637
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:34.430
<v Speaker 1>what about the culture part of it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1638
01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:37.660
<v Speaker 1>we do have to acknowledge that cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>are different,</v>

1639
01:07:37.661 --> 01:07:40.720
<v Speaker 1>that they respect different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They honor different things.</v>

1640
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:41.554
<v Speaker 1>They not every culture is tolerant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could eventually start bringing </v>

1641
01:07:45.551 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 1>in people who are intolerant of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms.</v>

1642
01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:49.663
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regardless of whether that's overblown </v>

1643
01:07:51.321 --> 01:07:52.640
<v Speaker 2>on the news or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get your point.</v>

1644
01:07:52.641 --> 01:07:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's overblown.</v>

1645
01:07:54.201 --> 01:07:55.650
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>

1646
01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.440
<v Speaker 2>theoretically possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1647
01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1648
01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the striking thing all over the </v>

1649
01:08:01.071 --> 01:08:02.720
<v Speaker 2>world and the most progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

1650
01:08:02.721 --> 01:08:06.230
<v Speaker 2>What is it that they feel about culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you feel like America is destroying</v>

1651
01:08:06.231 --> 01:08:07.730
<v Speaker 2>their culture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Iran,</v>

1652
01:08:07.731 --> 01:08:11.390
<v Speaker 2>they've long had this word they call </v>
<v Speaker 2>West toxification,</v>

1653
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:13.190
<v Speaker 2>west toxification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea.</v>

1654
01:08:13.191 --> 01:08:16.060
<v Speaker 2>There's all these horrible western ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>flooding into Iran,</v>

1655
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.350
<v Speaker 2>alienating your child read and </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying Islam.</v>

1656
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:19.483
<v Speaker 2>And here's why I say they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when like La Western culture is </v>

1657
01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people around the world love it,</v>

1658
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:26.384
<v Speaker 2>especially young people and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments around the world want to </v>

1659
01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:29.204
<v Speaker 2>stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to do the resort to extreme </v>

1660
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 2>measures in order to keep it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1661
01:08:32.721 --> 01:08:33.554
<v Speaker 2>And what does immigration do at weddings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and brings the people who brings people </v>

1662
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.453
<v Speaker 2>straight to the western culture where </v>
<v Speaker 2>their governments can no longer get </v>

1663
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 2>between them and the culture.</v>

1664
01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:43.160
<v Speaker 2>And the main thing that happens is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go native,</v>

1665
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1666
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 2>they may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also get,</v>

1667
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:47.660
<v Speaker 2>there's always some people on the news </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were refusing to do it,</v>

1668
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:50.080
<v Speaker 2>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a much larger group.</v>

1669
01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.800
<v Speaker 2>People who moved to the West and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

1670
01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:53.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may pay lip service to their home </v>

1671
01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:56.594
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they actually go and assimilate to </v>

1672
01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:00.480
<v Speaker 2>the new culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning here's my favorite test.</v>

1673
01:09:00.481 --> 01:09:03.260
<v Speaker 2>If you want to go and find out how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>a simulation is there,</v>

1674
01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:07.020
<v Speaker 2>talk to any immigrant parents and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>will they tell you to immigrant parents.</v>

1675
01:09:07.021 --> 01:09:07.970
<v Speaker 2>So they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

1676
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kid loves us,</v>

1677
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:12.140
<v Speaker 2>loves Romanian culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All he thinks about is Romania.</v>

1678
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Romania,</v>

1679
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:15.710
<v Speaker 2>all day being remaining is so central to</v>
<v Speaker 2>his life.</v>

1680
01:09:15.711 --> 01:09:16.860
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1681
01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:17.450
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1682
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:18.150
<v Speaker 2>what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1683
01:09:18.150 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife is from a radio.</v>

1684
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:23.000
<v Speaker 2>So the normal thing for your Manian </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrant parents,</v>

1685
01:09:23.001 --> 01:09:25.460
<v Speaker 2>it's like almost any immigrant parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to say,</v>

1686
01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I thought we could preserve our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my kid just doesn't care about it.</v>

1687
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.653
<v Speaker 2>I talked to my kid and Romanian and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer me back in English and my </v>

1688
01:09:32.691 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 2>grandkids don't speak a word Romania and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no interest in this stuff.</v>

1689
01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again to say over the old video,</v>

1690
01:09:37.611 --> 01:09:41.110
<v Speaker 2>so I'll just do basically Americanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>where western is in.</v>

1691
01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Will actually wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1692
01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I.</v>

1693
01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 2>So I have a blog post called Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is a hardy weed and says,</v>

1694
01:09:48.531 --> 01:09:48.831
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1695
01:09:48.831 --> 01:09:49.664
<v Speaker 2>I believe in Western civilization much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than most of the people who say </v>

1696
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:55.940
<v Speaker 2>they defend it because I think we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna I think we are winning right now.</v>

1697
01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think with open borders we will </v>
<v Speaker 2>win sooner,</v>

1698
01:09:59.300 --> 01:09:59.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>

1699
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:02.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so many of this is the kind of thing</v>

1700
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.790
<v Speaker 2>where someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone watching it in rand might say,</v>

1701
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:08.150
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew Kaplan had a plot by plot.</v>

1702
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:09.340
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean some,</v>

1703
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:13.250
<v Speaker 2>I do think that Western civilization is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the better civilization in most ways.</v>

1704
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:14.383
<v Speaker 2>I'm always happy to learn from other </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures and to have a cosmopolitan </v>

1705
01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:20.150
<v Speaker 2>combination of all of the best things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nevertheless,</v>

1706
01:10:20.151 --> 01:10:22.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that when we compile all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best things in the world,</v>

1707
01:10:22.971 --> 01:10:25.940
<v Speaker 2>I think 80 percent of the stuff is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come from Western civilization.</v>

1708
01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.193
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe we'll pick up the work ethic </v>

1709
01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:31.100
<v Speaker 2>from China or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we revitalized the work ethic.</v>

1710
01:10:31.101 --> 01:10:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So I think they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got something to offer there.</v>

1711
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:35.290
<v Speaker 2>But what do like that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1712
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:36.183
<v Speaker 2>my plan is to go and spread Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization more quickly and </v>

1713
01:10:39.441 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 2>effectively through immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1714
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:43.940
<v Speaker 2>And I think I'd say it is working right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1715
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:46.700
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to say like even Los Angeles where</v>

1716
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:48.890
<v Speaker 2>people look around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see people assimilating.</v>

1717
01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.660
<v Speaker 2>You always look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1718
01:10:50.661 --> 01:10:52.960
<v Speaker 2>what is the generation of the immigrants</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1719
01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a first generation immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then sure they have an assemble aided.</v>

1720
01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:56.653
<v Speaker 2>They never did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was never true that first generation </v>

1721
01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:01.350
<v Speaker 2>immigrants became fluent in English if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't,</v>

1722
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.990
<v Speaker 2>if they arrived in their twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1723
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:04.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always had trouble.</v>

1724
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:05.474
<v Speaker 2>They always stuck to the old ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assimilation is always worked on the </v>

1725
01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:08.984
<v Speaker 2>second generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go and talk to a second </v>

1726
01:11:10.821 --> 01:11:12.650
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican American in La,</v>

1727
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 2>the automobile speak fluent in English </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 90 percent.</v>

1728
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All y'all so and even for even like kids</v>

1729
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:21.960
<v Speaker 2>who were first generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as they came with their young,</v>

1730
01:11:21.961 --> 01:11:24.920
<v Speaker 2>so fluent English by far the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1731
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I just been going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

1732
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:28.200
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been going over this data so we can like</v>

1733
01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.034
<v Speaker 2>the main reason why we feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hispanic immigrants aren't assimilating </v>

1734
01:11:31.711 --> 01:11:32.544
<v Speaker 2>and just because in the past it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal to have like one generation wave </v>

1735
01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:36.174
<v Speaker 2>of Germans and then it stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One generation wave of Swedes are </v>

1736
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:39.624
<v Speaker 2>Italians and then it stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then in a couple generations there's </v>

1737
01:11:41.581 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Speaker 2>no longer any Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Italians in America who don't,</v>

1738
01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:45.534
<v Speaker 2>who don't speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because the first </v>

1739
01:11:46.921 --> 01:11:47.754
<v Speaker 2>generation learned English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because the first generation died </v>

1740
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:51.960
<v Speaker 2>and Italian stop coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1741
01:11:51.961 --> 01:11:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that again,</v>

1742
01:11:53.731 --> 01:11:55.740
<v Speaker 2>like when you understand what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation is about,</v>

1743
01:11:55.741 --> 01:11:56.574
<v Speaker 2>it's about changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second generation is still going on </v>

1744
01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.753
<v Speaker 2>at enormous levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we are already the sizing Latin </v>

1745
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:03.530
<v Speaker 2>America right now.</v>

1746
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:04.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wave part of this is interesting </v>

1747
01:12:05.181 --> 01:12:06.014
<v Speaker 1>because I think when people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ellis island thing and they think </v>

1748
01:12:08.631 --> 01:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1749
01:12:09.521 --> 01:12:12.480
<v Speaker 1>like the lower east side of Brooklyn in </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City,</v>

1750
01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.593
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know from 60 years ago when all </v>

1751
01:12:15.111 --> 01:12:20.111
<v Speaker 1>these Irish and German and Jews and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these other people came that yeah,</v>

1752
01:12:20.151 --> 01:12:23.000
<v Speaker 1>it was that first generation that had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that worked incredibly hard,</v>

1753
01:12:23.001 --> 01:12:25.600
<v Speaker 1>barely spoken language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived more sheltered and then.</v>

1754
01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.513
<v Speaker 1>And then the rest of what you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically happened and they move </v>

1755
01:12:28.131 --> 01:12:29.060
<v Speaker 1>throughout the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1756
01:12:29.061 --> 01:12:31.070
<v Speaker 1>let's do one more thing before I let you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1757
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Passive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that my policy on this by the way?</v>

1758
01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Did Not look at the notes once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good interview.</v>

1759
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1760
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:38.623
<v Speaker 1>so you've already done well passivism my</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular policy on this is that I </v>

1761
01:12:42.501 --> 01:12:44.870
<v Speaker 1>believe in a strong defense basically so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't have to use it.</v>

1762
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.823
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to nation build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should be all over the </v>

1763
01:12:47.271 --> 01:12:48.104
<v Speaker 1>place creating empires and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe you need a strong </v>

1764
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:52.880
<v Speaker 1>defense so that people won't mess with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1765
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you like that?</v>

1766
01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1767
01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.850
<v Speaker 2>so if you want peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare for war anyhow,</v>

1768
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:58.020
<v Speaker 2>ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient Roman saying.</v>

1769
01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1770
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.193
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so we just want to sit back and </v>

1771
01:13:01.801 --> 01:13:02.401
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said what are you?</v>

1772
01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is passivism and then what's the</v>

1773
01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:05.730
<v Speaker 2>art?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the argument for it?</v>

1774
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.290
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my passion is my don't.</v>

1775
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:08.124
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean never resisting violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't mean that if someone is </v>

1776
01:13:11.251 --> 01:13:13.650
<v Speaker 2>coming in with an ax you shouldn't fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>back or anything like that.</v>

1777
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and so,</v>

1778
01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:16.374
<v Speaker 2>and I'll rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I mean by passivism is opposition </v>

1779
01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:20.250
<v Speaker 2>to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1780
01:13:20.251 --> 01:13:23.670
<v Speaker 2>And so they'll stay organized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence organized by governments.</v>

1781
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:25.170
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what exactly,</v>

1782
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.033
<v Speaker 2>how exactly is that different in any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is that war is actually </v>

1783
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:30.263
<v Speaker 2>almost never defensive in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them were almost always involves </v>

1784
01:13:33.751 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 2>either deliberately murdering or </v>
<v Speaker 2>recklessly killing innocent people.</v>

1785
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1786
01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:39.923
<v Speaker 2>So this is really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it theoretically possible that it </v>

1787
01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:42.930
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1788
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:44.063
<v Speaker 2>But in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime you fight any kind of a serious </v>

1789
01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:46.794
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you either wind up deliberately </v>

1790
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.950
<v Speaker 2>murdering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdering a whole bunch of civilians,</v>

1791
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:51.083
<v Speaker 2>or you wind up recklessly endangering </v>
<v Speaker 2>them where you go when you drop a bomb </v>

1792
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.713
<v Speaker 2>in the general vicinity of a whole bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of civilians and you killed them as </v>

1793
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:58.320
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the big deal?</v>

1794
01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the police thought crime the same way</v>

1795
01:14:00.961 --> 01:14:03.090
<v Speaker 2>that the US government wages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wages,</v>

1796
01:14:03.091 --> 01:14:06.840
<v Speaker 2>war on the USB,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this would be way bigger protest than</v>

1797
01:14:06.841 --> 01:14:09.260
<v Speaker 2>anything that we're getting right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you need to go in.</v>

1798
01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.520
<v Speaker 2>So I would say you're now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1799
01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.473
<v Speaker 2>so I mean like so literally a minimum </v>
<v Speaker 2>just seems to me like there is some </v>

1800
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 2>moral problem with war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which again is glossed over by the,</v>

1801
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1802
01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1803
01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.780
<v Speaker 2>we're just defending ourselves.</v>

1804
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.020
<v Speaker 2>We'll normally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're defending yourself by sales,</v>

1805
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:24.460
<v Speaker 2>by murdering a bunch of innocent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1806
01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:25.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first glance,</v>

1807
01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:28.510
<v Speaker 2>this seems like it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People often want to say no,</v>

1808
01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:29.344
<v Speaker 2>there's no innocence on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's no innocent babies in </v>

1809
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:32.974
<v Speaker 2>the other country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one who has never done </v>

1810
01:14:34.271 --> 01:14:35.104
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like this is a pretty flimsy </v>

1811
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:38.410
<v Speaker 2>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also the,</v>

1812
01:14:38.411 --> 01:14:39.244
<v Speaker 2>well anyone we kill is totally on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands of the bad guys that we're </v>

1813
01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:44.260
<v Speaker 2>fighting against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1814
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:45.163
<v Speaker 2>so really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what if you went in like bomb </v>

1815
01:14:47.621 --> 01:14:52.090
<v Speaker 2>people in the neighboring country with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that beyond the hands of the bad guys to</v>

1816
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.580
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why exactly is it that like,</v>

1817
01:14:54.581 --> 01:14:57.610
<v Speaker 2>is there some limit to what you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>blame on the bad guys?</v>

1818
01:14:57.611 --> 01:14:58.444
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing if you've got someone </v>

1819
01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 2>holding a hostage right there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shooting.</v>

1820
01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.720
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if say there's just a bunch of,</v>

1821
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a school next to the next to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal.</v>

1822
01:15:06.851 --> 01:15:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Can you go and bomb the school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>

1823
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1824
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.330
<v Speaker 2>that's on him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1825
01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:12.220
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we killed that to all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids in that school,</v>

1826
01:15:12.221 --> 01:15:14.250
<v Speaker 2>like the light sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1827
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.840
<v Speaker 2>we were just trying to get that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>murderer St.</v>

1828
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:16.743
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that seems like a very flimsy </v>

1829
01:15:18.611 --> 01:15:19.444
<v Speaker 2>defense now again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I am actually never an </v>

1830
01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.480
<v Speaker 2>absolutist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1831
01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.960
<v Speaker 2>so I'm always willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1832
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe we have to do this terrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the greater good.</v>

1833
01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:29.613
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I always want to be open to that </v>

1834
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:32.200
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's where I say,</v>

1835
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:33.034
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's actually go and carefully </v>

1836
01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:36.610
<v Speaker 2>look at how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1837
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:39.620
<v Speaker 2>how great is this good and how certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>can you really be the audits.</v>

1838
01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1839
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:43.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you know,</v>

1840
01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.620
<v Speaker 2>just to back up.</v>

1841
01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.360
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1842
01:15:46.361 --> 01:15:47.194
<v Speaker 2>so like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1843
01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:48.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument for bassmans first APP is </v>

1844
01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:53.410
<v Speaker 2>just accepting the harsh reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That war is not really defensive.</v>

1845
01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:58.270
<v Speaker 2>It does involve actually going and </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdering or at least man slaughtering a</v>

1846
01:15:58.271 --> 01:15:59.104
<v Speaker 2>whole lot of innocent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like no matter the nicest country </v>

1847
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.901
<v Speaker 2>wages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

1848
01:16:01.901 --> 01:16:02.734
<v Speaker 2>the most careful one does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with modern weaponry will be hard </v>

1849
01:16:05.771 --> 01:16:06.840
<v Speaker 2>to do otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can that,</v>

1850
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.560
<v Speaker 2>can that be in and of itself moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1851
01:16:08.561 --> 01:16:11.980
<v Speaker 2>like so in case in the case of World War</v>
<v Speaker 2>II where we weren't our homeland,</v>

1852
01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:13.490
<v Speaker 2>well Pearl Harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our,</v>

1853
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:16.720
<v Speaker 2>our homeland wasn't threatened by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis per se,</v>

1854
01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.960
<v Speaker 2>by we killed a lot of people and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>allies firebombed,</v>

1855
01:16:19.961 --> 01:16:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Dresden and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also have been saved a lot.</v>

1856
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the like.</v>

1857
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:26.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's that next step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1858
01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:27.533
<v Speaker 2>first step is just accepting that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the United States government </v>

1859
01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:31.080
<v Speaker 2>murdered a lot of innocent key.</v>

1860
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:31.923
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Sun innocent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They murdered in the United States </v>

1861
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:34.990
<v Speaker 2>government murdered children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1862
01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:37.450
<v Speaker 2>They did the kind of thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack terrorists for,</v>

1863
01:16:37.451 --> 01:16:38.284
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is murdering a bunch of innocent </v>

1864
01:16:40.391 --> 01:16:42.580
<v Speaker 2>people for the grill because you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for the greater good.</v>

1865
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.170
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally when we,</v>

1866
01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.310
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we attacked it,</v>

1867
01:16:45.311 --> 01:16:46.990
<v Speaker 2>when we say terrorists are terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for this,</v>

1868
01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:48.063
<v Speaker 2>we don't have some big factual argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how what they're doing isn't </v>

1869
01:16:49.691 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 2>really for the greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you murdered innocent people.</v>

1870
01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1871
01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:55.444
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like there's at least a moral </v>

1872
01:16:57.671 --> 01:17:00.280
<v Speaker 2>presumption against this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which maybe it can be overcome again for</v>

1873
01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:03.780
<v Speaker 2>the greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's where I say that ceos.</v>

1874
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:04.623
<v Speaker 2>So there's this great philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>example involving a doctor who's got </v>

1875
01:17:08.621 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 2>five patients a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a different organ donation,</v>

1876
01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.013
<v Speaker 2>and then a guy walks by who happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be perfectly healthy and the doctor </v>

1877
01:17:15.411 --> 01:17:19.400
<v Speaker 2>thinks maybe I should go and murder that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy at harvest his organs,</v>

1878
01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 2>and then he searches and he has no </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

1879
01:17:21.111 --> 01:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>no one's really going to miss this guy.</v>

1880
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I can save five lives by murdering one </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1881
01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1882
01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Now people's normal reaction to this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

1883
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:33.410
<v Speaker 2>And the den.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you start brand new guy,</v>

1884
01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:36.060
<v Speaker 2>start ramping up the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a million people already,</v>

1885
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:39.440
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least that five to one ratio seems to</v>

1886
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:41.150
<v Speaker 2>really bother people and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1887
01:17:41.151 --> 01:17:44.240
<v Speaker 2>you can't go and deliberately murdered a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person to save five other people.</v>

1888
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.610
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it is this.</v>

1889
01:17:46.611 --> 01:17:49.430
<v Speaker 2>It is this premise that I bring in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my case against war saying,</v>

1890
01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.390
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1891
01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:53.270
<v Speaker 2>now maybe that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a war for the greater good,</v>

1892
01:17:53.271 --> 01:17:56.480
<v Speaker 2>but are you actually getting something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this five to one ratio,</v>

1893
01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:57.801
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And furthermore,</v>

1894
01:17:57.801 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 2>how confident can you really be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's right.</v>

1895
01:17:59.601 --> 01:18:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Bring in the last body of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that people's predictions about</v>

1896
01:18:02.541 --> 01:18:03.980
<v Speaker 2>the results of war are terrible.</v>

1897
01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.710
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of prediction is you have</v>

1898
01:18:06.711 --> 01:18:07.544
<v Speaker 2>to say what you think is gonna happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it happens and then you look at </v>

1899
01:18:10.161 --> 01:18:12.470
<v Speaker 2>what occurs and see how accurate your </v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction was.</v>

1900
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.873
<v Speaker 2>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1901
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.863
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a fantastic political </v>

1902
01:18:16.011 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 2>psychologist named Phil tetlock who ran </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big experiment along these lines.</v>

1903
01:18:20.031 --> 01:18:20.864
<v Speaker 2>So in the 19 eighties he went and asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of foreign policy experts their </v>

1904
01:18:23.211 --> 01:18:24.044
<v Speaker 2>predictions and then 20 years later came</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and weighed their predictions </v>

1905
01:18:27.351 --> 01:18:30.830
<v Speaker 2>against the actual results and they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>really badly.</v>

1906
01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.173
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is experimental evidence on </v>

1907
01:18:33.531 --> 01:18:34.364
<v Speaker 2>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people's ability to forecast the </v>

1908
01:18:35.631 --> 01:18:38.210
<v Speaker 2>actual long run benefits of war are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor.</v>

1909
01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Of course we don't really need to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments.</v>

1910
01:18:40.491 --> 01:18:44.000
<v Speaker 2>We can just go to the views about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened would have happened in Rwanda.</v>

1911
01:18:44.001 --> 01:18:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Rwanda were all sides are saying out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trenches by Christmas.</v>

1912
01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.790
<v Speaker 2>No one is saying I think this will end </v>
<v Speaker 2>in communist revolution.</v>

1913
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:53.540
<v Speaker 2>And certainly no one was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think the long run result of this</v>

1914
01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:55.430
<v Speaker 2>will be a communist regime in North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea.</v>

1915
01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:59.000
<v Speaker 2>A country doesn't even exist right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet if you know your history,</v>

1916
01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:02.330
<v Speaker 2>that is what it costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would that is the key events in why</v>

1917
01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:03.164
<v Speaker 2>there's communism North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now if you snap these pieces </v>

1918
01:19:05.601 --> 01:19:06.434
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so moral presumption against more five </v>

1919
01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:12.140
<v Speaker 2>to one ratio or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum in order for it to be justified.</v>

1920
01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:15.050
<v Speaker 2>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great uncertainty about what the effects</v>

1921
01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:15.884
<v Speaker 2>of war are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I get my case for </v>

1922
01:19:17.301 --> 01:19:18.980
<v Speaker 2>passivism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like anytime there's a war,</v>

1923
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 2>anytime there is someone proposing more </v>
<v Speaker 2>by accident.</v>

1924
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:23.810
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like first of all,</v>

1925
01:19:23.811 --> 01:19:26.300
<v Speaker 2>so he's even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't even a plausible that the,</v>

1926
01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:27.134
<v Speaker 2>that you are going to say five times as </v>
<v Speaker 2>many lives as you are going to murder </v>

1927
01:19:29.271 --> 01:19:30.390
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1928
01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:31.283
<v Speaker 2>and is it reasonable to be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>confident given how bad most people's </v>

1929
01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:34.900
<v Speaker 2>track records are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1930
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And if you put that together that I say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for almost any actual war is really</v>

1931
01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:40.820
<v Speaker 2>hard to make the case and the case in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his favor.</v>

1932
01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:45.900
<v Speaker 1>So let's say there were some terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Tiawana firing rockets into San Diego</v>

1933
01:19:47.051 --> 01:19:47.884
<v Speaker 1>where you're writing in a couple of days</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they keep firing these rockets or </v>

1934
01:19:49.961 --> 01:19:53.950
<v Speaker 1>they're sending people in to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in San Diego or something.</v>

1935
01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.280
<v Speaker 1>You would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be for doing something.</v>

1936
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:58.303
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1937
01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:00.400
<v Speaker 2>You're taking police action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1938
01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Like normally it's actually not bombing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tijuana.</v>

1939
01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:03.683
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a case where as long as </v>

1940
01:20:04.481 --> 01:20:05.314
<v Speaker 2>they were Muslim terrorists and Ilana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think most Americans would </v>

1941
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:07.973
<v Speaker 2>bombing tijuana even if the Mexicans </v>
<v Speaker 2>were floundering around and couldn't </v>

1942
01:20:10.381 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1943
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 2>They also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as the Mexican said,</v>

1944
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.910
<v Speaker 2>you can go and send in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American troops to deal with this,</v>

1945
01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:18.744
<v Speaker 2>but don't go bombing us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't go machine gunning whole villages </v>

1946
01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1947
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:23.150
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of you,</v>

1948
01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:23.983
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've no objection to anything like </v>

1949
01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:27.150
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anytime someone starts talking about</v>

1950
01:20:27.151 --> 01:20:27.984
<v Speaker 2>waging war with modern weaponry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're going to start murdering a </v>

1951
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:31.343
<v Speaker 2>lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like Bernie inevitably murder or </v>

1952
01:20:33.181 --> 01:20:34.650
<v Speaker 2>manslaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1953
01:20:34.651 --> 01:20:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salesforce and be murdered,</v>

1954
01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:39.660
<v Speaker 2>or you'd have to be trying to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manslaughter is just when you recklessly</v>

1955
01:20:39.661 --> 01:20:40.494
<v Speaker 2>endanger them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a buddy at anytime you're talking about </v>

1956
01:20:42.301 --> 01:20:42.870
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1957
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:43.703
<v Speaker 2>That's where my past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group is getting in the way and I </v>

1958
01:20:46.191 --> 01:20:47.024
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is another case where when </v>

1959
01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 2>someone fights award and ends really </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly,</v>

1960
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:51.661
<v Speaker 2>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1961
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:52.494
<v Speaker 2>what can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if someone opposes a war eventually </v>

1962
01:20:54.621 --> 01:20:55.290
<v Speaker 2>badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1963
01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:56.031
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>passive.</v>

1964
01:20:56.031 --> 01:20:56.864
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible idea like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you have caused all these </v>

1965
01:20:59.461 --> 01:21:00.820
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1966
01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:01.830
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1967
01:21:01.831 --> 01:21:02.340
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1968
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I think think it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

1969
01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:06.510
<v Speaker 2>is a fair historical point to say almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

1970
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:07.493
<v Speaker 2>almost every story and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anyone who knows any facts about the </v>

1971
01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.320
<v Speaker 2>world and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1972
01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:13.860
<v Speaker 2>just would have been better if any one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the major powers to just rendered,</v>

1973
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 2>if any one of the major powers will </v>
<v Speaker 2>robot it just said,</v>

1974
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:17.574
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we give in you when we'll do what you </v>

1975
01:21:18.871 --> 01:21:22.590
<v Speaker 2>want and that would have prevented so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many terrible things.</v>

1976
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Most obviously world war and yet people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet people will say,</v>

1977
01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:28.920
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>passivism would've led to disaster world</v>

1978
01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:29.960
<v Speaker 2>war two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we'd been this,</v>

1979
01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:30.803
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wouldn't have been in world war </v>

1980
01:21:30.991 --> 01:21:33.780
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we should get credit for that.</v>

1981
01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:35.063
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the actions lead to </v>

1982
01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:38.010
<v Speaker 2>other actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actions lead to other actions.</v>

1983
01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>notice what I'm not.</v>

1984
01:21:39.241 --> 01:21:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not claiming that we have like no </v>
<v Speaker 2>clue at all about whether we're.</v>

1985
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:42.763
<v Speaker 2>We'll do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the uncertainty by itself doesn't </v>

1986
01:21:45.241 --> 01:21:46.074
<v Speaker 2>really argue for or against war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the uncertainty combined with this </v>

1987
01:21:48.331 --> 01:21:49.164
<v Speaker 2>high threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying you've got to actually </v>

1988
01:21:50.941 --> 01:21:51.774
<v Speaker 2>know that you're saving five times as </v>
<v Speaker 2>many lives they're killing before we </v>

1989
01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:55.770
<v Speaker 2>should even be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even be talking about this.</v>

1990
01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:56.813
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the uncertainty is hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it is a barrier to war because </v>

1991
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like saying it's a close call.</v>

1992
01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Well like say with Sandia passivism has </v>
<v Speaker 2>all close calls,</v>

1993
01:22:04.861 --> 01:22:05.694
<v Speaker 2>go to peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't doubt fixe if it's a close </v>

1994
01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:09.210
<v Speaker 2>call because you're murdering innocent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1995
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:12.000
<v Speaker 2>So there's a very high threshold </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

1996
01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:12.751
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1997
01:22:12.751 --> 01:22:16.560
<v Speaker 2>so a higher even than the one of you for</v>
<v Speaker 2>spending taxpayer money,</v>

1998
01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:18.540
<v Speaker 2>you ought to know you're really doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something good with it.</v>

1999
01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2000
01:22:20.171 --> 01:22:21.004
<v Speaker 1>I have thoroughly enjoyed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We barely got into half of what I was </v>

2001
01:22:24.551 --> 01:22:25.990
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about where we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this again.</v>

2002
01:22:25.991 --> 01:22:26.824
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2003
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:27.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds great.</v>

2004
01:22:27.351 --> 01:22:28.184
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed this and I hope you </v>

2005
01:22:28.931 --> 01:22:32.230
<v Speaker 1>guys did too.</v>
