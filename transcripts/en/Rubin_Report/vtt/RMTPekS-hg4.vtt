1
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>It may sound strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a liberal,</v>

2
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:07.704
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptionalism due to our democratic </v>

3
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.634
<v Speaker 1>ideals and personal freedoms in America </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a unique and special country in the </v>

4
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that.</v>

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.273
<v Speaker 1>You may remember back in 2009 when </v>
<v Speaker 1>President Obama said he didn't really </v>

6
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>believe in American exceptionalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying quote,</v>

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I believe in American exceptionalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as I suspect that the Brits believe</v>

8
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:28.434
<v Speaker 1>in British exceptionalism and the Greeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in Greek exceptionalism in and </v>

9
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:33.954
<v Speaker 1>of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with Obama's </v>

10
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:35.874
<v Speaker 1>general idea here in which each </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual country is filled with proud </v>

11
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>people who believe that their country is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique and special in the world.</v>

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.033
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of fuels people to build a </v>

13
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>better society that they can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely proud of.</v>

14
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Then fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

15
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.234
<v Speaker 1>by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this nationalism could also push </v>

16
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:54.204
<v Speaker 1>otherwise good people to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have inordinate sway over </v>

17
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>the world or influence other nations </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're morally superior.</v>

18
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Over the eight years of Obama's </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidency,</v>

19
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:05.514
<v Speaker 1>he walked back this statement and did </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually say that America's </v>

20
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.503
<v Speaker 1>exceptionalism was unique for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an additional reason for </v>

21
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:14.034
<v Speaker 1>American exceptionalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which goes beyond just our democratic </v>

22
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>ideals and our personal freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we are the only country in the</v>

23
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.044
<v Speaker 1>world to share those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the additional piece that </v>

24
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:25.944
<v Speaker 1>America is a country of immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country of people from all over the </v>

25
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>world who came here to make a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>life for themselves.</v>

26
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.683
<v Speaker 1>We are a nation built by people whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors often came here with nothing </v>

27
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:38.454
<v Speaker 1>and who worked hard to build a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and life for their children and </v>

28
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:42.624
<v Speaker 1>their children's children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we certainly aren't the only </v>

29
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>country to welcome immigrants or to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a solid middle class,</v>

30
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.013
<v Speaker 1>there's no other nation on earth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>more people from more countries have </v>

31
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>come to live and prosper because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of happiness.</v>

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean that everyone can come</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and we can have open borders,</v>

33
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean that if you come here </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally,</v>

34
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>you'll be given the same chance as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural born citizen.</v>

35
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.463
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we live in a politically fractured </v>

36
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:09.984
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many people will tell you that </v>

37
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:12.204
<v Speaker 1>things have never been worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that things have actually </v>

38
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>never been better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

39
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:16.794
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that for every specific </v>

40
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:18.744
<v Speaker 1>person or every specific job or specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry times change and soda people </v>

41
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>and economies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a whole,</v>

42
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:26.064
<v Speaker 1>America has done an incredible job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcoming so many diverse people having </v>

43
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>us all share in the American dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while at the same time all being able to</v>

44
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>keep traditions and practices from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique cultures.</v>

45
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>As our economy changes over the next few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

46
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>we the people have a massive job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing along with it.</v>

47
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.593
<v Speaker 1>In an age where supermarkets will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>automated and driverless cars will </v>

48
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:49.794
<v Speaker 1>replace truck drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be more important than ever for </v>

49
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:53.334
<v Speaker 1>us to change along with the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world doesn't stop for anyone or </v>

50
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.703
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to adapt to a changing world </v>

51
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.000
<v Speaker 1>and in these moments of change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's usually where America has been at</v>

52
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.863
<v Speaker 1>its best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our system built on the idea that it's </v>

53
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:09.604
<v Speaker 1>your job to pursue your happiness is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that more people still want to </v>

54
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>come to America right now than any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>country on earth.</v>

55
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.843
<v Speaker 1>I always find it ironic that so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who rant and rave about how evil </v>

56
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>America is are the same people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand that we let anyone in here.</v>

57
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone want to come to such an</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

58
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>unfair and oppressive society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

59
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>this is nonsense and these people know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

60
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason that people don't leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>America in droves.</v>

61
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.563
<v Speaker 1>Even the celebrities who said they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave if trump was elected have somehow </v>

62
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:41.164
<v Speaker 1>managed to stay here for the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that Canada is happy </v>

63
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't have to take in most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

64
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned all of this because for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the goodness here in America,</v>

65
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>we obviously still have some work to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every society has worked to do,</v>

66
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>which is why people peddling utopia are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always frauds.</v>

67
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>In Liars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In America,</v>

68
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>though almost every generation has </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought to expand rights to other people,</v>

69
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:03.844
<v Speaker 1>not to limit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we got women the right to </v>

70
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:06.874
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we freed the slaves and </v>

71
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:08.614
<v Speaker 1>that's how gay people were allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>marry and that's how whatever will come </v>

72
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>next will arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As for that work that we have to do,</v>

73
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:17.044
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it has to do with how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can come together instead of just </v>

74
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>ripping each other apart.</v>

75
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firm believer that most of us want</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same things in life.</v>

76
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>We want to work a decent job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat some good food,</v>

77
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>have some sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go on vacation now and again,</v>

78
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 1>most of us aren't racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobe secretly plotting against each</v>

79
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>other and trying to push our way of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>on everyone else.</v>

80
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>This is somewhere which no matter where </v>
<v Speaker 1>your political leanings are,</v>

81
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>we can all come together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

82
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 1>some of us are from big cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of us are from small towns.</v>

83
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:48.964
<v Speaker 1>Some of us have had ancestors who </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived on the mayflower and some of us </v>

84
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>just arrived yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only way this all works is if we</v>

85
00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>all bend to fit the American ideals of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom and of liberty,</v>

86
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>not if we demand that the system bend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

87
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is comedian trae </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowder.</v>

88
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Trey is known as the liberal redneck.</v>

89
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they do exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His comedy is a blend of showing liberal</v>

90
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:13.264
<v Speaker 1>elites that rednecks aren't all </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards Hicks and showing rednecks </v>

91
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>that liberals aren't all evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialists.</v>

92
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if we should judge people</v>
<v Speaker 1>as individuals,</v>

93
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>not as groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where have I heard that before?</v>

94
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.703
<v Speaker 1>You know the middle of this country for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time has been the brunt of jokes </v>

95
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:28.654
<v Speaker 1>and the easy way to make fun of anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who thinks differently than the people </v>

96
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.733
<v Speaker 1>in New York or Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As someone who has only lived in New </v>

97
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.053
<v Speaker 1>York or Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never subscribed to this way of </v>

98
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:39.604
<v Speaker 1>thinking and I've tried not to mock </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just because they talk </v>

99
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>differently or haven't evolved on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>social views.</v>

100
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>The second that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a Democrat or Republican,</v>

101
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:50.520
<v Speaker 1>straight or gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black or white,</v>

102
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>native American or new immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country belongs to all of us and it</v>

103
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>needs all of us to continue to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

104
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.513
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing with exceptionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes an awful lot of work to keep </v>

105
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.114
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week is a comedian and </v>

106
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a redneck and liberal cray crowder.</v>

107
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.443
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten to here in mind a redneck </v>

108
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.503
<v Speaker 1>and a liberal that throws people a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I have to even ask you a question to </v>

109
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>start this thing or do I just hand it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you there?</v>

110
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

111
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.080
<v Speaker 2>so what has become my favorite way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>define that?</v>

112
00:06:28.081 --> 00:06:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I was actually was actually said to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>at one of my comedy shows in Austin,</v>

113
00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:33.204
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guy from Mississippi who now lives in </v>

114
00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:36.924
<v Speaker 2>Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fan came up to me and was talking to </v>

115
00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:39.174
<v Speaker 2>me and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seemed so genuinely frustrated too </v>

116
00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:43.194
<v Speaker 2>about like all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he's been stereotyped or whatever </v>

117
00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:47.010
<v Speaker 2>for being a redneck or whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

118
00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:47.970
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

119
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

120
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I like to blow shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I ain't fucking racist.</v>

121
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.423
<v Speaker 1>Eddie seemed like so upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wanting to put my hand on his </v>

122
00:06:57.861 --> 00:06:58.311
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

123
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I know buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all right.</v>

124
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.670
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

125
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically just,</v>

126
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in,</v>

127
00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I was very stereotypically redneck </v>
<v Speaker 2>fashion,</v>

128
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.863
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.270
<v Speaker 2>dirt poor and the middle of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee.</v>

130
00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:11.104
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be redneck by basically any </v>

131
00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:16.630
<v Speaker 2>standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never,</v>

132
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I've never subscribed to any of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a,</v>

133
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me regressive ideologies and stuff </v>

134
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:26.710
<v Speaker 2>that rednecks or stereotypical known for</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't even,</v>

135
00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:28.780
<v Speaker 2>it never even really all that weird to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

136
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.973
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known for awhile now that it's </v>

137
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:31.804
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying I never even had to </v>

138
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.023
<v Speaker 2>really think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how I will make a conscious </v>

139
00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:39.270
<v Speaker 2>decision to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Weirdo thing.</v>

141
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.050
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just happens,</v>

142
00:07:43.051 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much how I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it works for everybody.</v>

143
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what really,</v>

144
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:51.720
<v Speaker 1>if you had to define what a redneck is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what really is a redneck?</v>

145
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people for some reason assume </v>
<v Speaker 2>that black,</v>

147
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm like opposed to this guy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason.</v>

148
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 2>But I actually have a lot of respect for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

149
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:06.050
<v Speaker 2>But I think Jeff foxworthy defined it </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best.</v>

150
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>It involves the TV on another team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not yet.</v>

151
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you made a whole career out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>defining,</v>

152
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 1>but he got assets.</v>

153
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I watched a lot of the way he ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 2>defined it was he said it's the glorious</v>

154
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:18.714
<v Speaker 2>absence of sophistication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I pretty well agree with and in </v>

155
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.820
<v Speaker 2>our book that we wrote with my tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>mates,</v>

156
00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:26.250
<v Speaker 2>cory and drew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sort of added an addendum to that,</v>

157
00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:31.230
<v Speaker 2>which was a not given a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking about how people feel</v>

158
00:08:31.231 --> 00:08:34.260
<v Speaker 2>about you and the way you live your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

159
00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:37.230
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd do what I do and I liked what I like</v>

160
00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:39.360
<v Speaker 2>and I don't give a damn what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it or not.</v>

161
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 2>That coupled with the aforementioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of sophistication a is what makes a</v>

162
00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:46.650
<v Speaker 2>redneck to me.</v>

163
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So interestingly,</v>

164
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:48.544
<v Speaker 1>it's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I think people will </v>

165
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:54.070
<v Speaker 1>prescribe political leanings to redness </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and of itself,</v>

166
00:08:54.071 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the idea</v>

167
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 2>of Sorta I do what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:08:58.951 --> 00:08:59.784
<v Speaker 2>And want to be left alone and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have a good time and all that </v>

169
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I honestly,</v>

170
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 2>and I feel so I guess naive or ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever saying this now,</v>

171
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.624
<v Speaker 2>but I genuinely didn't realize that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many people it had those like </v>

172
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 2>political connotations or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>

173
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I knew rednecks were stereotyped as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

174
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb or,</v>

175
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Brad or racist or whatever.</v>

176
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:25.824
<v Speaker 2>I knew those things existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know that to so many </v>

177
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

178
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.310
<v Speaker 2>part of the definition of the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>redneck is a regressive,</v>

179
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.534
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobe who hates books and loves </v>

180
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Jesus now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

181
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

182
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like nothing else,</v>

183
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.393
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that that existed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level that it does until very </v>

184
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

185
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've done a bunch of videos on </v>

186
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:51.714
<v Speaker 2>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think untangling some of that stuff </v>

187
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 2>and showing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually no,</v>

188
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 2>that's not really all there is to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

189
00:09:56.821 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 2>But how poor did you grow up because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're white,</v>

190
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:01.704
<v Speaker 2>so I assume you get white privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you not have a lot of white </v>

191
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 2>privilege growing up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Whitey.</v>

192
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 2>So I've actually had to get used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being white.</v>

193
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've gotten into the middle class and</v>

194
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:16.240
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the past few years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's a recent phenomenon for me.</v>

195
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.340
<v Speaker 2>I tell people that sometimes it's true </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know it sounds weird to people.</v>

196
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:21.174
<v Speaker 2>I never felt white growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to imply that I felt black </v>

197
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:25.951
<v Speaker 2>or it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

198
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I'm saying.</v>

199
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:28.254
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is my whole life when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about white people and white </v>

200
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:32.510
<v Speaker 2>people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've caught a flight,</v>

201
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Connecticut,</v>

202
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 2>like very Yuppie Ish.</v>

203
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.033
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the landed gentry,</v>

205
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.093
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I thought of when I </v>

206
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 2>heard of white people and I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were white trash,</v>

207
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 2>which is completely different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

208
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Like I point out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I a good example,</v>

209
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I like to use this cops right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now don't get me wrong,</v>

210
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 2>they're not shooting rednecks in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets,</v>

211
00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:56.964
<v Speaker 2>but it's a well established thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally that like cops and rednecks </v>

212
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 2>don't get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

213
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Every episode of cops they ever made in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ghetto or the trailer park,</v>

214
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.253
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there was definitely that </v>

215
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.650
<v Speaker 2>feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

216
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never felt privileged at all.</v>

217
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:18.714
<v Speaker 2>To answer your question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's not the same as saying </v>

218
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:22.344
<v Speaker 2>that I don't think white privilege like </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist in a lot of arenas or whatever it </v>

219
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:29.520
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you're poor,</v>

220
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really matter very much.</v>

221
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.040
<v Speaker 2>The good thing is though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a good thing,</v>

222
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:40.041
<v Speaker 2>but if you manage to become not poor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a white man than hey,</v>

223
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.820
<v Speaker 2>let's just isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

224
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 2>So now I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much you have,</v>

225
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing all right now you're on</v>
<v Speaker 2>tour,</v>

226
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:50.140
<v Speaker 2>you're doing good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got some,</v>

227
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.990
<v Speaker 2>some TV things cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've,</v>

228
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 2>you've gotten yourself out of white </v>
<v Speaker 2>trash that I managed to escape,</v>

229
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.823
<v Speaker 2>which is not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can summer in the Hamptons and </v>

230
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 2>go to Connecticut on that level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just at the beginning.</v>

231
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.223
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny about that is mop my whole </v>

232
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:08.734
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had this thing where you mentioned </v>

233
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 2>like the Hamptons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been,</v>

234
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 2>but like I promise you if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if me and you went to the hamptons right</v>

235
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 2>now and we like pull it and we first get</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and whatever,</v>

236
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.000
<v Speaker 2>I would immediately become very </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable and it's,</v>

237
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 2>and it's an uncommon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a discomfort is in a,</v>

238
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't belong here kind of way,</v>

239
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also an element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

240
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.370
<v Speaker 2>they know they're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>

241
00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:38.010
<v Speaker 2>like look at me and like who's who let </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

242
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trailer trash in here,</v>

243
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

244
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 2>And I know that that's irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really do like feel that I have.</v>

245
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>

246
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 2>So you grow up white trash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>redneck community in Tennessee.</v>

247
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.233
<v Speaker 2>Give me some of the good stuff about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because you've talked about the </v>

248
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 2>good stuff in the values and that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>

249
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature is a big one.</v>

250
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Like it's absolutely beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

251
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:03.740
<v Speaker 2>The best part about my home county is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

252
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 2>like Dale Hollow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like objectively awesome.</v>

253
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.973
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you're in Danny outdoorsy </v>

254
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got that in spades.</v>

255
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

256
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.710
<v Speaker 2>the sense of community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows everybody.</v>

257
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 2>There's cons to that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

258
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's a lot of good things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

259
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 2>like people actually genuinely care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about each other for the most part.</v>

260
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.300
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

261
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 2>the food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of,</v>

262
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

263
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

264
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 2>my grandmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them,</v>

265
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what most people would call soul food or</v>

266
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 2>whatever I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just,</v>

267
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frying everything,</v>

268
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.323
<v Speaker 2>whatever else.</v>

269
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Not good for the arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but good for the soul.</v>

270
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

271
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 2>the music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the south as far as regions go,</v>

272
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:53.630
<v Speaker 2>I think the south has the best music or </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces the best music in the country,</v>

273
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

274
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.340
<v Speaker 2>just the way I mentioned earlier a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.600
<v Speaker 2>people like to have a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

276
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:06.601
<v Speaker 2>Like people are not a very tightly wound</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

277
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.580
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more like laid back and uh,</v>

278
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.583
<v Speaker 2>just like relaxed atmosphere and none of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole black stereotypical rat race </v>

279
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:17.050
<v Speaker 2>stuff that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any of that.</v>

280
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because sometimes I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>neat.</v>

281
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:22.050
<v Speaker 2>There's a part of me that needs that or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants that obviously,</v>

282
00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:22.884
<v Speaker 2>or I wouldn't be doing any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a part of me that </v>

283
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 2>appreciates that more like pastoral type</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in my hometown.</v>

284
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

285
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:31.663
<v Speaker 2>what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about some of the political stuff </v>

286
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.770
<v Speaker 2>when you add that to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

287
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:37.660
<v Speaker 2>so far we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got kind of the good stuff,</v>

288
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.861
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

289
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:39.694
<v Speaker 2>the political stuff is where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>start going out there and they're all </v>

290
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's weird to me,</v>

291
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.363
<v Speaker 2>and I've talked to like people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>places like I'm from about this a lot </v>

292
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 2>and they pretty well agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as a kid growing up,</v>

293
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.493
<v Speaker 2>people were mostly a political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they were like Democrats </v>

294
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 2>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like I don't,</v>

295
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 2>they didn't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

296
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to be more of an attitude of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

297
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:05.690
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell with them all,</v>

298
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.070
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all full of shit.</v>

299
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:09.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

300
00:15:09.221 --> 00:15:10.054
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was pretty much it and </v>

301
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.403
<v Speaker 2>obviously that has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been gone from the town I grew </v>

302
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:16.124
<v Speaker 2>up in for 12 years now and obviously a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot has changed since I left because </v>

303
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.003
<v Speaker 2>it's not like that didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was never aware of it being this </v>

304
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:25.844
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like curl cultural dividing factor or </v>

305
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:28.130
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

306
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:28.963
<v Speaker 2>Most people just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just didn't really talk about it or </v>

307
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:33.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever as I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

308
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

309
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hometown is a good example,</v>

310
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 2>the factory lift and went to Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 2>after Nafta and all that,</v>

311
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the ripple effects of that were</v>

312
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:45.254
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took awhile for it to get as bad as </v>

313
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 2>it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's bad and has been bad for</v>

314
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:50.870
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like over 13,</v>

315
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 2>14 percent unemployment or whatever for </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a decade now.</v>

316
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's just made a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 2>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrated and upset and whatever else.</v>

318
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.150
<v Speaker 2>And that wasn't really the case when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a kid or not on the level that it is</v>

319
00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:08.984
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's really what it's </v>

320
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've gotten pissed,</v>

321
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're like way of life has </v>

322
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:16.544
<v Speaker 2>been altered very negatively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them and so I think </v>

323
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:20.744
<v Speaker 2>that's where they've gotten so riled up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and mad like they are now because I'm </v>

324
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 2>not trying to like they were this </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightened group because they weren't.</v>

325
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 2>But when I was living there and growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up there just it,</v>

326
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have this like rage age they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have now.</v>

327
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't as much of a thing.</v>

328
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:42.770
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird to me too,</v>

329
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:43.330
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

330
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.163
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that say something interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>just about economics in general like </v>

331
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.283
<v Speaker 1>that you grew up around this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a factory so people were </v>

332
00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:52.060
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even if things weren't perfect,</v>

333
00:16:52.061 --> 00:16:52.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's life,</v>

334
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.640
<v Speaker 1>it's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody else has been.</v>

335
00:16:54.641 --> 00:16:57.820
<v Speaker 1>The jobs go away and then suddenly it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually changes everything.</v>

336
00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean at any time,</v>

337
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 2>obviously you're not unique to salon in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my hometown,</v>

338
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.190
<v Speaker 2>this is the story I'm most places like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

339
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.110
<v Speaker 2>but so the jobs leave and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

340
00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:07.944
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pills come in or the math or </v>

341
00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:10.194
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug use substance abuse goes through </v>

342
00:17:12.601 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 2>the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sodas,</v>

343
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime like theft,</v>

344
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

345
00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:19.560
<v Speaker 2>The businesses start shuttering the </v>
<v Speaker 2>downtown areas like,</v>

346
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally dilapidated and whatever else.</v>

347
00:17:22.321 --> 00:17:23.154
<v Speaker 2>And it just brings everybody way down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just this like cycle of </v>

348
00:17:27.841 --> 00:17:30.020
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She hit that,</v>

349
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.380
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

350
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it really,</v>

351
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really pisses people off or get them </v>

352
00:17:36.601 --> 00:17:38.010
<v Speaker 2>going or both or whatever.</v>

353
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:38.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

354
00:17:38.731 --> 00:17:39.564
<v Speaker 1>So before we go any further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I have to get your liberal </v>

355
00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:42.504
<v Speaker 1>credit too because I know we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk a little bit about what we both </v>

356
00:17:44.701 --> 00:17:47.270
<v Speaker 1>feel like it's happening on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always say like,</v>

357
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.750
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still a liberal.</v>

358
00:17:48.751 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm for legalizing marijuana.</v>

359
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm pro choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in state education.</v>

360
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

361
00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:55.983
<v Speaker 1>and the list goes on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm against the death penalty and for </v>

362
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 1>reforming prison system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

363
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are liberal things.</v>

364
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 1>So can you just lay out some liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>credits so that 10 minutes from now when</v>

365
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 1>we get onto some other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

366
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.384
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really liberal Gimme Gimme some </v>

367
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 1>liberal stuff.</v>

368
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.833
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with literally everything you </v>

369
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:11.934
<v Speaker 2>just named off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with all of those sort of a </v>

370
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 2>gateway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberalism for me was,</v>

371
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equal rights for gay people because my </v>

372
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 2>uncle is gay and I've found that out </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was like eight or nine and a,</v>

373
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 2>which is when I found that what gave and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

374
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.223
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know anything about it </v>

375
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:29.904
<v Speaker 2>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I learned what gay men I </v>

376
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Speaker 2>learned how your uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gay.</v>

377
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

378
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:33.894
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that I started picking up on things </v>

379
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 2>before just went over my head that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

380
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:42.450
<v Speaker 2>these rednecks or whatever that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>grown up around that they were saying or</v>

381
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 2>that the church was saying about gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

382
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.240
<v Speaker 2>And I immediately didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

383
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.540
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of pushed me in that direction</v>

384
00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:52.374
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

385
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.423
<v Speaker 2>And so that's always been a big thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me because I take it a little </v>

386
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:58.080
<v Speaker 2>personally because of my uncle whom I </v>
<v Speaker 2>love dearly,</v>

387
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 2>but then everything else you named from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the prison reform very,</v>

388
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:04.450
<v Speaker 2>very against the war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vr.</v>

389
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.623
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that I feel very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly about because it's also </v>

390
00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:08.034
<v Speaker 2>personal because my mom is a recovering </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug addict who also was a drug dealer </v>

391
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:13.680
<v Speaker 2>who went to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

392
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm all that very personal to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I completely agree with it.</v>

393
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm a believer,</v>

394
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:21.540
<v Speaker 2>obviously it needs to be done the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

395
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:23.950
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a believer in universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>

396
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Speaker 2>I also am very pro food stamps and </v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare and things like that.</v>

397
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.943
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like it would be baldly</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypocritical of me if I wasn't because </v>

398
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:36.870
<v Speaker 2>like I survived on food stamps as a kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know what I mean,</v>

399
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:37.704
<v Speaker 2>like one food stamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what would've happened to </v>

400
00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:39.900
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

401
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

402
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.033
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm living proof that those </v>

403
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 2>systems can work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

404
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.600
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get abused.</v>

405
00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:49.434
<v Speaker 2>But that's just the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've asked my attitude towards that has </v>

406
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:54.870
<v Speaker 2>always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is the alternative though?</v>

407
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Letting kids go hungry because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do that,</v>

408
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.620
<v Speaker 2>so we got to just put up with some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the abuses.</v>

409
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 2>That's how I've looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

410
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

411
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 2>all the info.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think eventually we're going to need a</v>

412
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:08.304
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think there's going to be enough jobs </v>

413
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.850
<v Speaker 2>that exist for the amount of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>

414
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.043
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the reality of where the world is </v>

415
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 2>going on and all that stuff is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>

416
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.070
<v Speaker 1>You're a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

417
00:20:24.071 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

418
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.073
<v Speaker 1>Did you see this story this week about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon is going to have a supermarket </v>

419
00:20:28.511 --> 00:20:30.580
<v Speaker 1>with three employees because everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

420
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.200
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scan your phone,</v>

421
00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.260
<v Speaker 1>you take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave.</v>

422
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Speaker 2>They uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

423
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:36.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

424
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a promo video or something for</v>

425
00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 2>that on Youtube that I saw a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago.</v>

426
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just</v>

427
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.110
<v Speaker 1>literally walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get whatever you want,</v>

428
00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:48.300
<v Speaker 1>throw it in a bag and walk out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got scanners</v>

429
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.941
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

430
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean in that kind of thing is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going away.</v>

431
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:54.040
<v Speaker 2>One of the biggest ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody realizes at this point</v>

432
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 2>how close we're getting to self driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>vehicles.</v>

433
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt that that's happening.</v>

434
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:07.050
<v Speaker 2>And a truck drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the number one occupation in</v>

435
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:12.970
<v Speaker 2>something like 37 of the 50 states in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country or something like that.</v>

436
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.833
<v Speaker 2>The most popular job as a truck driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the minute that they have freight that </v>

437
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:22.060
<v Speaker 2>can be fully automated reliably and </v>
<v Speaker 2>safely,</v>

438
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:22.923
<v Speaker 2>they will and all of that will just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>away overnight and that's going to </v>

439
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:28.990
<v Speaker 2>happen in a lot of industries too and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

440
00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 2>what else are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

441
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's just how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think again,</v>

442
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:35.794
<v Speaker 2>that's the reality of it is take </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like a universal basic income </v>

443
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 2>or you think that that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer more than basically retraining an</v>

444
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:43.924
<v Speaker 2>entire population to either fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers or the robots or the drones </v>

445
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:49.580
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or any of that.</v>

446
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.470
<v Speaker 2>So that may be a bridge too far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

447
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

448
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

449
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:55.264
<v Speaker 2>So you're not going to take a truck </v>
<v Speaker 2>driver and have them fixed and groans </v>

450
00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.521
<v Speaker 2>just as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

451
00:21:57.521 --> 00:21:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also I think even if you tried to do</v>

452
00:21:59.831 --> 00:22:00.664
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how many drop drones there </v>

453
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:04.040
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you think about,</v>

454
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:09.060
<v Speaker 2>let's say like every one robot replaces </v>
<v Speaker 2>one person in a job capacity,</v>

455
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 2>which is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true anymore way,</v>

456
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.851
<v Speaker 2>way more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's.</v>

457
00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:13.684
<v Speaker 2>Even if it is that I would think that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance person for that robot would </v>

458
00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 2>also take care of 30 other robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

459
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not going to be broken down </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

460
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.913
<v Speaker 2>You understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can take the one guy that </v>

461
00:22:27.901 --> 00:22:30.070
<v Speaker 2>replaces and he's going to fix robots </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

462
00:22:30.071 --> 00:22:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to just fix the one robot</v>

463
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:35.240
<v Speaker 2>that took his job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to fix 40 robots.</v>

464
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 2>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

465
00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:39.940
<v Speaker 2>the reality is one robot replaces 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or whatever.</v>

466
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.130
<v Speaker 2>When you just follow that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.330
<v Speaker 2>that logic down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't track for me.</v>

468
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Even if you wanted to do that retraining</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people or whatever else,</v>

469
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.110
<v Speaker 2>the numbers just don't add up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I'm not,</v>

470
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an economist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedian.</v>

471
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

472
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good in the scheme of </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic sense.</v>

473
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:01.654
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to be alive at the time when </v>

474
00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 2>we know robots are going to replace us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

475
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:08.380
<v Speaker 2>like where it's not science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

476
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

477
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.563
<v Speaker 2>20 years from now we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they started to talk show hosts </v>

478
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:13.563
<v Speaker 2>Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to be replaced by </v>

479
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 2>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

480
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Speaker 2>And in 20 years er might be list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

481
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.163
<v Speaker 2>people in San Francisco will be getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>super pissed at Alabama for having like </v>

482
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 2>anti robot laws like that.</v>

483
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.283
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alabama was going to be discriminating </v>

484
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:29.344
<v Speaker 2>against a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans or whatever will becoming an </v>

485
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.520
<v Speaker 2>episode of Futurama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

486
00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.383
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

487
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.290
<v Speaker 2>it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to back up for a second.</v>

488
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:39.124
<v Speaker 2>So your uncle that you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've heard you talk about how he </v>

489
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:43.000
<v Speaker 2>influenced your sort of awakening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>

490
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.280
<v Speaker 2>so people might find that interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there,</v>

491
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.180
<v Speaker 2>there was a gay man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say 15 years ago or so in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>south that existed.</v>

493
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 2>How is life for him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

494
00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.173
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds sort of ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think people actually don't </v>

495
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 2>understand that you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even before gay marriage,</v>

496
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 2>gay people existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lived lives,</v>

497
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 2>some good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some bad,</v>

498
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like everybody else.</v>

499
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I was a kid,</v>

500
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.310
<v Speaker 2>my uncle lived in Nashville and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

501
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.740
<v Speaker 2>another thing a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize is that for the most part,</v>

502
00:24:14.741 --> 00:24:16.700
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities are cities,</v>

503
00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:17.381
<v Speaker 2>whether it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:24:17.381 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Birmingham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alabama,</v>

505
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.690
<v Speaker 2>it's still a city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means there's still plenty of like</v>

506
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.500
<v Speaker 2>liberal ideals and whatever else there.</v>

507
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 2>And so like he lived in Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is totally different,</v>

508
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.773
<v Speaker 2>totally different than Salana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he came back a lot and then when I </v>

509
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:31.514
<v Speaker 2>was in high school from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did live in salina and now I've </v>

510
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 2>thought before and after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm an adult,</v>

511
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.823
<v Speaker 2>that may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a good possibility that he did </v>

512
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:45.440
<v Speaker 2>go through a lot of shitty things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty treatment,</v>

513
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.283
<v Speaker 2>whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like he didn't tell me about it </v>

514
00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 2>because I was a kid and he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean.</v>

515
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:50.474
<v Speaker 2>And I had enough bad shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to burden me with it or </v>

516
00:24:54.051 --> 00:24:56.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very good possibility.</v>

517
00:24:56.151 --> 00:25:00.650
<v Speaker 2>But so far as I'm aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never faced any.</v>

518
00:25:00.651 --> 00:25:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Like he definitely never gotten beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never got like,</v>

519
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a deli,</v>

520
00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:05.864
<v Speaker 2>they're in town for awhile or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>else and he never got like a brick </v>

521
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 2>thrown through the window or nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

522
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.930
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

523
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 2>he's not the only gay guy in the town </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

524
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:14.810
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy,</v>

525
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if there's a local </v>
<v Speaker 2>businessman who is a gay guy.</v>

526
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.790
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

527
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.680
<v Speaker 2>when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to,</v>

528
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 2>he had a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for that area.</v>

529
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.823
<v Speaker 2>And so when we were in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd come to high school ball games and </v>

530
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Celina Tennessee with like two little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Cuban boy toys.</v>

531
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of Catholic boy,</v>

532
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where he got them.</v>

533
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody did.</v>

534
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.570
<v Speaker 2>But what I mean is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

535
00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:42.880
<v Speaker 2>he flaunted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

536
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 2>And nothing ever happened to him either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was just Kinda like,</v>

537
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Steve,</v>

538
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Steve Is,</v>

539
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.560
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like what happened with the</v>

540
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Cubans that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

541
00:25:52.941 --> 00:25:54.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was done with them.</v>

542
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.633
<v Speaker 2>I went back or whatever he got and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it got to a Ukrainian boy toys or </v>

543
00:25:59.211 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

544
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:00.511
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

545
00:26:00.511 --> 00:26:01.430
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

546
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

547
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again at the time,</v>

548
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:06.134
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize how insane that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably be to a lot of people to know </v>

549
00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:10.004
<v Speaker 2>that that had happened there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get tarred and feathered or </v>

550
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:16.280
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was just a thing that people.</v>

551
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

552
00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:18.800
<v Speaker 2>that people were definitely like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

553
00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:20.450
<v Speaker 2>here he goes again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

554
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.493
<v Speaker 2>But he's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like the extent of it and </v>

555
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 2>that's still not okay to be disgusted by</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people obviously,</v>

556
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:29.084
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never translated to any kind of like </v>

557
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.810
<v Speaker 2>violence or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

558
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.360
<v Speaker 2>get the hell out of our town types.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw anything like that,</v>

559
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 2>but mostly just don't talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

560
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird way though.</v>

561
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 2>That actually</v>

562
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 1>is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

563
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:46.284
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like you actually are </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be disgusted by somebody or </v>

564
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 1>be racist or b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

565
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

566
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 1>we don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

567
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:54.444
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't dislike someone because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the color of their skin or their </v>

568
00:26:56.371 --> 00:26:57.204
<v Speaker 1>secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day you're saying </v>

569
00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of live and let live people </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

570
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 1>So even if they saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't like it.</v>

571
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:04.770
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're not hurting somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what are you gonna do?</v>

572
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I can remember once when I was a kid at </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

573
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like practice or something.</v>

574
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Some older kid was giving me shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my uncle was gay or whatever,</v>

575
00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:16.920
<v Speaker 2>which wasn't a rare thing and after it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>over some,</v>

576
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:17.783
<v Speaker 2>this guy who I still like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the most outwardly </v>

577
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:24.230
<v Speaker 2>stereotypical redneck people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't imagine that.</v>

578
00:27:24.231 --> 00:27:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's openly redneck type guy,</v>

579
00:27:27.841 --> 00:27:29.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean as red as it gets,</v>

580
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 2>especially in this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like he came up to me afterwards,</v>

581
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:33.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>

582
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.200
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

583
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 2>your uncle's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my in tray,</v>

584
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let them get whatever.</v>

585
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm saying.</v>

586
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:41.240
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

587
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way,</v>

588
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 2>way more complicated than people </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

589
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.990
<v Speaker 2>like it's not just this but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I meet people,</v>

590
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:49.824
<v Speaker 2>I meet people on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot of gay fans and so like </v>

591
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:53.814
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meet gay people in like Portland or </v>

592
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:59.190
<v Speaker 2>wherever who grew up in Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

593
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 2>And there they just have just horror </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

594
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

595
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.160
<v Speaker 2>and I know they're not lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's the reality.</v>

596
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.380
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated,</v>

597
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:07.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

598
00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.780
<v Speaker 1>so you're telling me your personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience can blanket the entire thing.</v>

599
00:28:10.781 --> 00:28:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

600
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:18.040
<v Speaker 1>My anecdotal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as bad as people think it is,</v>

601
00:28:18.041 --> 00:28:19.840
<v Speaker 1>but there's still a lot of room for </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

602
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Where does the religion piece get mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that?</v>

603
00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Because I think a lot of the sort of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coast,</v>

604
00:28:25.601 --> 00:28:26.434
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York la sort of hatred or </v>

605
00:28:28.631 --> 00:28:33.250
<v Speaker 1>mocking of rednecks and southern culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because of the religious attachment,</v>

606
00:28:33.251 --> 00:28:34.084
<v Speaker 1>particularly Christianity because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the easiest thing to attack all the </v>

607
00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:36.994
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that stuff is associated </v>

608
00:28:38.831 --> 00:28:39.790
<v Speaker 1>with religion do you think?</v>

609
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Couple years ago I would've told you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just about every single bit of it.</v>

610
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.923
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people ask me how I became a </v>

611
00:28:46.431 --> 00:28:47.264
<v Speaker 2>liberal redneck or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would talk about my uncle like I </v>

612
00:28:50.031 --> 00:28:50.864
<v Speaker 2>already did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the effect that that had was I </v>

613
00:28:53.571 --> 00:28:54.404
<v Speaker 2>stopped going to church because of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the homophobic shit they were spouting </v>

614
00:28:58.041 --> 00:28:59.270
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

615
00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:00.380
<v Speaker 2>well to hell with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

616
00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:03.530
<v Speaker 2>like why would I take Jesus aside over </v>
<v Speaker 2>my uncle?</v>

617
00:29:03.531 --> 00:29:05.660
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never even emailed Jesus,</v>

618
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.200
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not going to take his.</v>

619
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.780
<v Speaker 2>So I left the church and that and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I always thought.</v>

620
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.123
<v Speaker 2>That's what I always attributed a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that too and I blame the church for a </v>

621
00:29:16.011 --> 00:29:16.844
<v Speaker 2>lot of these attitudes in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really been enlightened a lot </v>

622
00:29:22.101 --> 00:29:24.690
<v Speaker 2>myself in the past couple of years with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the er,</v>

623
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 2>especially the past year being on tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking to so many people in so many</v>

624
00:29:27.981 --> 00:29:30.940
<v Speaker 2>places and my two tour mates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>coauthors,</v>

625
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:31.783
<v Speaker 2>cory and drew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they grew up heavily in the church and </v>

626
00:29:34.011 --> 00:29:36.560
<v Speaker 2>ultimately left it with checks out.</v>

627
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.950
<v Speaker 2>After talking to them and talking to so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many other people at shows and stuff.</v>

628
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that simple.</v>

629
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that that has a lot to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it a whole lot to do with it,</v>

630
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 2>but I used to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be like,</v>

631
00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 2>if there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we weren't the Bible belt,</v>

632
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:51.910
<v Speaker 2>if you took all the Jesus out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>south,</v>

633
00:29:51.911 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 2>it'd be totally fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

634
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:55.803
<v Speaker 2>It's just not because of the economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors and you still have the whole </v>

635
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 2>historical factors and racial factors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that kind of stuff that wouldn't</v>

636
00:30:03.641 --> 00:30:06.130
<v Speaker 2>go away just because you got rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

637
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:08.630
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean it's,</v>

638
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 2>it definitely has a lot to do with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

639
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:11.044
<v Speaker 2>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly when it comes to gay </v>

640
00:30:13.361 --> 00:30:14.194
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people and Muslims and the way they </v>

641
00:30:15.851 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 2>feel about those two groups I still </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is mostly Jesus' fault.</v>

642
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Jesus right there.</v>

643
00:30:22.881 --> 00:30:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Even though Jesus probably would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been around a lot of Muslims.</v>

644
00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 1>It was the Middle East and uh,</v>

645
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.211
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

646
00:30:30.211 --> 00:30:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about the actual Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about,</v>

647
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus the first American.</v>

648
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

649
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.270
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

650
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Who wrote to Texas on a train with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine gunners saying that Jesus,</v>

651
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.133
<v Speaker 1>speaking of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me about your come to Jesus </v>

652
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 1>moment when you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

653
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I am a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

654
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.030
<v Speaker 1>so you had your uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had this sort of awakening,</v>

655
00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:49.990
<v Speaker 1>but when were you like,</v>

656
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.590
<v Speaker 2>this is the political stuff that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in.</v>

657
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to actually sort of come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to people that you knew?</v>

658
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

659
00:30:57.211 --> 00:30:59.550
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned briefly earlier that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

660
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I never realized it was weird until </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>

661
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably either late high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>or college was when I realized how </v>

662
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.910
<v Speaker 2>different it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I never thought much about the fact</v>

663
00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:14.790
<v Speaker 2>that I disagreed with certain people </v>
<v Speaker 2>about certain things,</v>

664
00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:16.800
<v Speaker 2>but the biggest factor was again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

665
00:31:16.801 --> 00:31:18.360
<v Speaker 2>people just didn't really talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

666
00:31:18.361 --> 00:31:21.120
<v Speaker 2>So it never really got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.420
<v Speaker 2>tossed around for me to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

668
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.263
<v Speaker 2>we're on completely different pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time that I can remember </v>

669
00:31:28.741 --> 00:31:31.440
<v Speaker 2>really thinking that outside of just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

670
00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:32.983
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

671
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:33.893
<v Speaker 2>gay rights thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just chalked up as a religious </v>

672
00:31:36.031 --> 00:31:36.864
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a political thing was in high </v>

673
00:31:38.781 --> 00:31:39.614
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

674
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.493
<v Speaker 2>In our English class we would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>debates because we didn't have a debate </v>

675
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.913
<v Speaker 2>team or debate class or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd have debates like once every other </v>

676
00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:49.200
<v Speaker 2>week and one time in debate class thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was teacher was like,</v>

677
00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:51.570
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like 2000,</v>

678
00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:53.520
<v Speaker 2>two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

679
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thinks we should not go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

680
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thinks we should go to war </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Iraq,</v>

681
00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:04.050
<v Speaker 2>raise your hand and it's about half the </v>
<v Speaker 2>students or whatever.</v>

682
00:32:04.051 --> 00:32:04.920
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

683
00:32:04.921 --> 00:32:07.460
<v Speaker 2>everybody thinks that we shouldn't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>over that.</v>

684
00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raise your hand.</v>

685
00:32:08.311 --> 00:32:11.260
<v Speaker 2>And it was literally just me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was the only thing again,</v>

686
00:32:11.261 --> 00:32:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I threw my hand up without even </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

687
00:32:12.601 --> 00:32:12.961
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

688
00:32:12.961 --> 00:32:13.794
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I looked around and I was the only </v>

689
00:32:15.991 --> 00:32:18.630
<v Speaker 2>one and then that other half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd where,</v>

690
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

691
00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:20.334
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now if you just don't know or don't </v>

692
00:32:21.331 --> 00:32:22.260
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise your hand.</v>

693
00:32:22.261 --> 00:32:24.000
<v Speaker 2>And that was the other half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

694
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:24.871
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

695
00:32:24.871 --> 00:32:26.550
<v Speaker 2>everybody doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're with trey,</v>

696
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody else here on this side or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

697
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.400
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

698
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.290
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty enlightened teacher </v>
<v Speaker 1>given you the,</v>

699
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:34.440
<v Speaker 1>all the people that didn't really care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving it to the piece,</v>

700
00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.293
<v Speaker 1>get these guy instead of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it ended up just being me against </v>

701
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I was</v>

702
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 2>fine with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

703
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 2>but that was probably the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I sort of had that,</v>

704
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:46.604
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to Jesus moment where I realized </v>

705
00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:52.190
<v Speaker 2>that like I wasn't like most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I was surrounded by.</v>

706
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did you get into standup?</v>

707
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 2>So wanted to be a standup since I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>

708
00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:58.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm Chris Rock's bigger and blacker came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and watched it with my dad and </v>

709
00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do that.</v>

710
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.080
<v Speaker 2>But it was never a question of me like </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to college or not.</v>

711
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Like with my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandpa,</v>

712
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:11.271
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

713
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:12.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go to college,</v>

714
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I going to be the first one from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>family to graduate from college,</v>

715
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 2>whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was a big thing and so I did and</v>

716
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't regret it at all.</v>

717
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.680
<v Speaker 2>But I focused on that for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then by the time I got,</v>

718
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:25.514
<v Speaker 2>I went to business school and by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time I got out I was 24 and that's when </v>

719
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:30.614
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

720
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.850
<v Speaker 2>if I'm ever going to do comedy at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be nail.</v>

721
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's when I started,</v>

722
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.710
<v Speaker 2>when I was 24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six and a half years ago.</v>

723
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.140
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a success because if you were the</v>

724
00:33:39.141 --> 00:33:39.974
<v Speaker 1>first family member to go to college and</v>
<v Speaker 1>business school and then you became a </v>

725
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:44.540
<v Speaker 1>failed comedian man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

726
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 1>that would be the worst day possible.</v>

727
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

728
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad was always cool with it.</v>

729
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.093
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my dad was mostly cool with </v>

730
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

731
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:55.244
<v Speaker 2>But my dad would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'd tell him I wanted to be a </v>

732
00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 2>comedian or be in Showbiz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

733
00:33:58.401 --> 00:34:00.580
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

734
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.893
<v Speaker 2>But outside of him though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every other authority figure in my life </v>

735
00:34:05.721 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 2>from my grandfather's two guidance </v>
<v Speaker 2>counselors,</v>

736
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:09.970
<v Speaker 2>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

737
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:12.950
<v Speaker 2>because I always made really good grades</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would tell me like,</v>

738
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

739
00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.970
<v Speaker 2>you have an opportunity to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and you can do whatever you want.</v>

740
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.370
<v Speaker 2>You can be a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a doctor,</v>

741
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:23.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>

742
00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:24.494
<v Speaker 2>And I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I told them I think I want to be a </v>

743
00:34:26.601 --> 00:34:27.560
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>

744
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

745
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.850
<v Speaker 2>not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that,</v>

746
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:32.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.173

<v Speaker 2>That was the universal response to that </v>

750
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

751
00:34:41.691 --> 00:34:42.524
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna waste it all trying to be a </v>

752
00:34:44.421 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 2>comedian or is what I got a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

754
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is working.</v>

00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:50.950
<v Speaker 1>So now you're in La</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

759
00:34:56.571 --> 00:34:58.650
<v Speaker 2>it's fun for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

760
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

761
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing fine with it.</v>

762
00:35:01.851 --> 00:35:02.684
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

763
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.003
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's weird for people around me </v>

764
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.093
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely get a lot of like a </v>

765
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 2>sideways glances and stuff like that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

766
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:16.310
<v Speaker 2>like if I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got two little boys so I've got all</v>

767
00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.213
<v Speaker 2>my boys at the park or something and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling at them because they're doing </v>

768
00:35:20.631 --> 00:35:22.700
<v Speaker 2>something they shouldn't be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

769
00:35:22.701 --> 00:35:25.180
<v Speaker 2>But I'm yelling at a child and this like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't got damaged.</v>

770
00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean with like a trucker hat on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever else.</v>

771
00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:29.510
<v Speaker 2>And then I noticed that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

772
00:35:29.511 --> 00:35:31.360
<v Speaker 2>they stopped doing couple's yoga over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

773
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.273
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is off putting to people and </v>

774
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.870
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

775
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>hearing the southern drawl.</v>

776
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean we just don't hear it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forgetting whether you like it or not.</v>

777
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just simply don't hear it.</v>

778
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.990
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot of like,</v>

779
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Kinda thing.</v>

780
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I think it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

781
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind it.</v>

782
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.413
<v Speaker 2>So when I was watching a bunch of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube videos in the last couple of </v>

783
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought wow,</v>

784
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 2>here is a liberal that I agree with on </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

785
00:35:58.501 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you before,</v>

786
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:00.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

787
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.983
<v Speaker 2>I was born in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived my whole life in New York City </v>

788
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:03.414
<v Speaker 2>until I moved out to la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the only two places I ever lived are </v>

789
00:36:05.951 --> 00:36:06.784
<v Speaker 2>New York and La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I watch your stuff and I find </v>

790
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:09.354
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Tennessee red neck who's a liberal </v>

791
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:13.650
<v Speaker 2>who I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy gets what?</v>

792
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:14.603
<v Speaker 2>Liberalism is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you sense about the general </v>

793
00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:20.430
<v Speaker 2>state of liberalism because it's become </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

794
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.780
<v Speaker 2>like a hot button word that can be used </v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess a little bit in a positive way,</v>

795
00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 2>but almost at all levels now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being used in a negative way.</v>

796
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

797
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:33.600
<v Speaker 1>from my allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even from my liberal allies,</v>

798
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's starting to.</v>

799
00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:40.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's to me in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism has jumped the shark.</v>

800
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.983
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just went too far with so many </v>

801
00:36:44.481 --> 00:36:45.314
<v Speaker 2>things and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and you were talking off air earlier </v>

802
00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:51.560
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that like where I'm from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

803
00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:52.693
<v Speaker 2>And we've already kind of touched on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where I'm from and where I've spent </v>

804
00:36:54.801 --> 00:36:56.630
<v Speaker 2>most of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

805
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm Karl Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

806
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm as far left as it gets.</v>

807
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.500
<v Speaker 2>They're out here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

808
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a centrist or whatever,</v>

809
00:37:08.631 --> 00:37:11.780
<v Speaker 2>probably because that's just how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>

810
00:37:11.781 --> 00:37:13.400
<v Speaker 2>And it's true on both sides though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the thing.</v>

811
00:37:13.401 --> 00:37:14.234
<v Speaker 2>It's like with the tea party and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever else and how it politically </v>

812
00:37:16.641 --> 00:37:19.220
<v Speaker 2>we've been pushed to the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

813
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.503
<v Speaker 2>the opposite extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's absolutely true on the left </v>

814
00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:23.744
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't really know what has </v>

815
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:27.854
<v Speaker 2>happened to cause that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just like maybe the </v>

816
00:37:30.141 --> 00:37:32.470
<v Speaker 2>cultural divide between the two and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

817
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back and forth and sort of pushing</v>

818
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:35.744
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The distaste that each side has for the </v>

819
00:37:39.051 --> 00:37:44.051
<v Speaker 2>other side just pushes them as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much further away from the opposition is</v>

820
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.480
<v Speaker 2>they can go or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

821
00:37:47.481 --> 00:37:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a comedian.</v>

822
00:37:48.531 --> 00:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm pulling that out of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

823
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:52.040
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I,</v>

824
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.660
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

825
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.543
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll look all of our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal experiences are what make the </v>

826
00:37:58.241 --> 00:37:59.350
<v Speaker 1>reality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

827
00:37:59.351 --> 00:38:01.840
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about for a long time.</v>

828
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I've watched the left go off this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched it,</v>

829
00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:04.794
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go off this way.</v>

830
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firm believer that there's huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot right now for,</v>

831
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.053
<v Speaker 1>for people somewhere in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because I have a lot of </v>

832
00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:15.331
<v Speaker 1>libertarians on and I now find much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>in common as a liberal with libertarians</v>

833
00:38:16.931 --> 00:38:19.570
<v Speaker 1>that I do with leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do,</v>

834
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.680
<v Speaker 1>what do we do with that as good liberals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that want to bring the left?</v>

835
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't ever get.</v>

836
00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:28.270
<v Speaker 2>My thing is like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economically might not across the board,</v>

837
00:38:28.271 --> 00:38:32.030
<v Speaker 2>but in most ways economically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like libertarianism is not familiar.</v>

838
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of the shit that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribe to that I don't at all.</v>

839
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:40.710
<v Speaker 2>So you went from being a firm bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you want more of a state,</v>

840
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:42.820
<v Speaker 2>you see more utility for estate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>

841
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:44.383
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely think that it's necessary </v>

842
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.560
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong.</v>

843
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.660
<v Speaker 2>A lot of bloat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

844
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at way out of hand and doesn't need</v>

845
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:52.864
<v Speaker 2>to be reined in some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that it's also a little personal </v>

846
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:55.474
<v Speaker 2>to me because I said I went to business </v>
<v Speaker 2>school so I wasn't waiting tables doing </v>

847
00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.943
<v Speaker 2>moonlighting as a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked for the US Department of </v>

848
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:02.883
<v Speaker 2>Energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my day job when I was like </v>

849
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 2>getting into comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

850
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know firsthand about like the bloat of</v>

851
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:10.864
<v Speaker 2>the federal government and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inefficiencies of our bureaucracy and </v>

852
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.000
<v Speaker 2>all that and it needs to be cleaned up.</v>

853
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:17.643
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's necessary though that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a government that sort of </v>

854
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.960
<v Speaker 2>regulates and polices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

855
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.220
<v Speaker 2>some of these other systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly basically my.</v>

856
00:39:28.221 --> 00:39:33.010
<v Speaker 2>And I just don't trust rich people to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's right for everybody else.</v>

857
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.143
<v Speaker 2>I never have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think I ever will because </v>

858
00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:36.723
<v Speaker 2>that's just human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to do a trap for </v>

859
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:41.680
<v Speaker 2>them and the people live in their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>self interest,</v>

860
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 2>not across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by and large.</v>

861
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:44.884
<v Speaker 2>And so I think we need systems in place </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sort of keep that from happening if </v>

862
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:49.220
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

863
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.123
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the catch 22 also though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because now the government is run by </v>

864
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:54.510
<v Speaker 2>rich people too and capitalism and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

865
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.503
<v Speaker 2>so it's like we either have business </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich people doing it or political rich </v>

866
00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.240
<v Speaker 2>people and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

867
00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.430
<v Speaker 2>we're all kind of caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

868
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.273
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing is I'm a big believer </v>

869
00:40:02.891 --> 00:40:03.760
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

870
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.123
<v Speaker 2>that we live in a plutocracy and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big problem for me because of </v>

871
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 2>everything I just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is the reality of it.</v>

872
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:12.851
<v Speaker 2>I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

873
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:14.830
<v Speaker 2>the rich people run the government or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and that,</v>

874
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a damn shame.</v>

875
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.433
<v Speaker 2>But like I'm saying philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think there's a definite need for </v>

876
00:40:24.311 --> 00:40:25.430
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

877
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

878
00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:30.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but socially though,</v>

879
00:40:30.431 --> 00:40:32.910
<v Speaker 2>and in a lot of other white </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians,</v>

880
00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely more in line with them on</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

881
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

882
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro legalization of a really just </v>
<v Speaker 2>about any drug,</v>

883
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.720
<v Speaker 2>to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

884
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm also pro gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

885
00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 2>growing up that that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the least liberal thing about me,</v>

886
00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:49.234
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's a freedom thing and I'd </v>

887
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.193
<v Speaker 2>actually use a liberal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a leftist that's the </v>

888
00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:56.710
<v Speaker 2>difference between liberal to you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect yourself.</v>

889
00:40:56.711 --> 00:40:58.190
<v Speaker 2>That is a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

890
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I've actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never bought a gun.</v>

891
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:05.520
<v Speaker 2>I own 17 guns because I inherited my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather's arsenal right now.</v>

892
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:08.643
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying in the south where I'm </v>

893
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:14.701
<v Speaker 2>from that super common and so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not weird to me.</v>

894
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not like dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you want to own a gun?</v>

895
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you want gun?</v>

896
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:20.463
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for background checks and all </v>

897
00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:25.610
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gun show loopholes and all that need</v>

898
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:27.370
<v Speaker 2>to be closed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for all that.</v>

899
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.930
<v Speaker 2>But just generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got no problem with guns and um,</v>

900
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro,</v>

901
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a believer in freedom,</v>

902
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 2>real freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

903
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the way I've always looked at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay rights to,</v>

904
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.393
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he thought in the privacy of your </v>

905
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:42.081
<v Speaker 2>own home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bedroom,</v>

906
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:42.914
<v Speaker 2>whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go wild long as you're not hurting </v>

907
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:45.950
<v Speaker 2>anybody else who gives a shit.</v>

908
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's across the board for me.</v>

909
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a classical liberal,</v>

910
00:41:49.491 --> 00:41:51.060
<v Speaker 1>but I guess for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

911
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.240
<v Speaker 1>a tour thing,</v>

912
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.160
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just dropped the class,</v>

913
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

914
00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.600
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also that,</v>

915
00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:00.780
<v Speaker 2>and I mean I'm aware of the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>again philosophically,</v>

916
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:05.760
<v Speaker 2>but my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the south or in the rural south,</v>

917
00:42:05.761 --> 00:42:07.630
<v Speaker 2>especially like a liberal's liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

918
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.683
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're either a liberal or you're not </v>

919
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.370
<v Speaker 2>like classical versus progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>

920
00:42:14.371 --> 00:42:15.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

921
00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.330
<v Speaker 2>That shit matters where I'm from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

922
00:42:18.331 --> 00:42:21.660
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about it in those terms,</v>

923
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.130
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

924
00:42:23.131 --> 00:42:23.731
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

925
00:42:23.731 --> 00:42:24.564
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

926
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.620
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>

927
00:42:25.621 --> 00:42:26.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

928
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get my show to,</v>

929
00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:29.733
<v Speaker 1>to Tennessee then because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to do is show people </v>

930
00:42:32.171 --> 00:42:36.010
<v Speaker 1>the difference between real liberalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what and what is happening.</v>

931
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.023
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely need that in the south </v>

932
00:42:38.071 --> 00:42:39.660
<v Speaker 2>because that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

933
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.520
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they,</v>

934
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.093
<v Speaker 2>well that's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big thing in the south for a </v>

935
00:42:44.671 --> 00:42:45.690
<v Speaker 2>long time as people asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

936
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.460
<v Speaker 2>why did they vote against their self </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>

937
00:42:47.461 --> 00:42:47.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I mean,</v>

938
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:48.840
<v Speaker 2>or whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

939
00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:49.674
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't think that you </v>

940
00:42:49.831 --> 00:42:51.990
<v Speaker 2>reflect their self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

941
00:42:51.991 --> 00:42:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And I think arguably a lot of liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies do,</v>

942
00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:00.350
<v Speaker 2>but all they know about liberals is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

943
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:02.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elitist,</v>

944
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 2>a fru,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fru ovary,</v>

945
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.170
<v Speaker 2>overly pc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

946
00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:07.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

947
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:12.810
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing is all that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of when it comes to liberals and,</v>

948
00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:16.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's like a total nonstarter for </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them.</v>

949
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Is that the funny thing about trump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the south,</v>

950
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:21.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like they took really a New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

951
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:24.080
<v Speaker 1>a New York Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big government.</v>

952
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.640
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big government guy.</v>

953
00:43:25.641 --> 00:43:27.200
<v Speaker 1>He's happy to do all these executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders,</v>

954
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:28.034
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rich guy and elitist all of those </v>

955
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:30.351
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I get it.</v>

956
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 1>He was out of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was out of the political system.</v>

957
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:34.920
<v Speaker 1>So he's thought of as an outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

958
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:35.531
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's eight.</v>

959
00:43:35.531 --> 00:43:36.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not religious,</v>

960
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to believe that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>believes in Christianity.</v>

961
00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:40.364
<v Speaker 1>The one time he sweat during the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign was that he went to Liberty </v>

962
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.230
<v Speaker 1>University and I had to repeat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Corinthians or whatever.</v>

963
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the irony with them?</v>

964
00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

965
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.510
<v Speaker 1>they love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

966
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually,</v>

967
00:43:52.171 --> 00:43:53.004
<v Speaker 2>I've thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've talked a lot about this exact </v>

968
00:43:54.901 --> 00:43:58.380
<v Speaker 2>thing because I in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel so naive about this now,</v>

969
00:43:58.381 --> 00:44:02.310
<v Speaker 2>but like I was genuinely stunned when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump actually won.</v>

970
00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.173
<v Speaker 2>I knew that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I shouldn't have been because I'm </v>

971
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:09.060
<v Speaker 2>from where he won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If anybody I should have been now.</v>

972
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I was like cautioning people that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time like,</v>

973
00:44:11.251 --> 00:44:12.840
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something real here.</v>

974
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:13.703
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day I didn't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would happen and I was shocked and </v>

975
00:44:15.631 --> 00:44:19.350
<v Speaker 2>maybe the biggest reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I felt this way throughout his whole</v>

976
00:44:19.351 --> 00:44:20.184
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking around like what is going </v>

977
00:44:21.961 --> 00:44:23.660
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I,</v>

978
00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not an assumption or a theory.</v>

979
00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:32.301
<v Speaker 2>I promise you I know this to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If could go back in time,</v>

980
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.190
<v Speaker 2>like five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years ago,</v>

981
00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.213
<v Speaker 2>whenever it was before he first went </v>
<v Speaker 2>after Obama for being an African Muslim </v>

982
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:40.524
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

983
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 2>If we could go back to pre that and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>polled rednecks,</v>

984
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 2>rural working class Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about Donald Trump?</v>

985
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Because Donald Trump's been famous for </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

986
00:44:51.341 --> 00:44:53.910
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think about Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dude,</v>

987
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 2>it would have been almost universally </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>

988
00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:58.523
<v Speaker 2>I promise you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have hated everything up and </v>

989
00:45:00.881 --> 00:45:01.714
<v Speaker 2>they did hate everything about him until</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got into all this political shit and </v>

990
00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:06.090
<v Speaker 2>started pandering to them that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

991
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.970
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an,</v>

992
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:08.883
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a latest silver spoon up is I asked </v>

993
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Yankee who thinks he's better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody and thanks,</v>

994
00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 2>he's better and thinks he knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

995
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:16.380
<v Speaker 2>And he's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big city Democrat,</v>

996
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:17.214
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

997
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

998
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:20.850
<v Speaker 2>they would have hated everything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

999
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.570
<v Speaker 2>And so the whole time I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1000
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.890
<v Speaker 2>him throughout his entire rise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking around like,</v>

1001
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.460
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This dude really?</v>

1002
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.593
<v Speaker 2>And what that says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what I've told myself anyway to make </v>

1003
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:34.494
<v Speaker 2>sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that just goes to show how desperate </v>

1004
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:42.141
<v Speaker 2>they were for a champion of any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were so desperate for that,</v>

1005
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 2>that even Donald Trump was good enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them to fill that bill.</v>

1006
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:47.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1007
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's legit in a way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

1008
00:45:49.811 --> 00:45:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I get that from a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get mail my,</v>

1009
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.503
<v Speaker 1>my audiences all over the place from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from far left people to anarchists to </v>

1010
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:56.383
<v Speaker 1>everything everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I get a lot of that people just </v>

1011
00:45:58.011 --> 00:45:58.880
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1012
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I just the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

1013
00:46:02.151 --> 00:46:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I've had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had it.</v>

1014
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.490
<v Speaker 1>You think that's a legit reason to vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone that you may have nothing in</v>

1015
00:46:07.491 --> 00:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>common with it you may think is a snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil salesman.</v>

1016
00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that sometimes the right way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1017
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Not to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1018
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:14.304
<v Speaker 2>I've never agreed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a lot of that to have a lot </v>

1019
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:16.944
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was talking about is a little </v>

1020
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:19.284
<v Speaker 2>bit different when you talk about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in like my hometown where you </v>

1021
00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:22.494
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bind Nafta and they blamed the </v>

1022
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Clintons and whatever else for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>factory leaving and all this.</v>

1023
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.660
<v Speaker 2>It's more than just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1024
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 2>he's shaking the system up it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was making promises directly to them.</v>

1025
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:32.994
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bring your job back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>restore your livelihood and all this </v>

1026
00:46:34.951 --> 00:46:35.784
<v Speaker 2>stuff in that connected with people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they thought he was a </v>

1027
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:40.740
<v Speaker 2>snake oil salesman or even if deep down </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they did a little bit.</v>

1028
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I think they lied to themselves and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1029
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.570
<v Speaker 2>deluded themselves into believing he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't.</v>

1030
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.030
<v Speaker 2>But I've also encountered a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are,</v>

1031
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:49.100
<v Speaker 2>like you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1032
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will shake things up.</v>

1033
00:46:51.511 --> 00:46:53.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something different.</v>

1034
00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Whenever we nailed this system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken,</v>

1035
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.250
<v Speaker 2>let's mix it up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've never been on board with that.</v>

1036
00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Like the general premise of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1037
00:47:01.621 --> 00:47:02.460
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1038
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I kinda am with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in this iteration,</v>

1039
00:47:06.361 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 2>really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how you want to manifest that is</v>

1040
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:10.530
<v Speaker 2>through Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1041
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.693
<v Speaker 2>Nah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the system for for eight more </v>

1042
00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:14.791
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1043
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:17.580
<v Speaker 2>and then let's get a different maverick </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

1044
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Isn't this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1045
00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.420
<v Speaker 2>I've never agreed with that.</v>

1046
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we just sort of forget that</v>

1047
00:47:23.531 --> 00:47:24.364
<v Speaker 1>all of us forgetting what our political </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiance is that we all kind of just </v>

1048
00:47:26.561 --> 00:47:28.870
<v Speaker 1>forget how actually good at here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1049
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Not to say that there aren't problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1050
00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:32.950
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1051
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.750
<v Speaker 1>but that it's pretty damn good</v>

1052
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:35.763
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1053
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I've actually been trying to work on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit about that for a long time now about</v>

1054
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:41.853
<v Speaker 2>basically that about things are better </v>
<v Speaker 2>here now than they've been for almost </v>

1055
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 2>any group of people you can name ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1056
00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:55.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's even true for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1057
00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 2>rural white people except things were </v>
<v Speaker 2>better for them and like,</v>

1058
00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple decades ago.</v>

1059
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying if you go back further </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that,</v>

1060
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.240
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't so great.</v>

1061
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 2>It was absolutely horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were sharecroppers,</v>

1062
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:07.743
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had a little window of like </v>

1063
00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:10.120
<v Speaker 2>prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were small town,</v>

1064
00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:10.954
<v Speaker 2>America was a real thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrialism and whatever else outside </v>

1065
00:48:13.481 --> 00:48:14.314
<v Speaker 2>of that little window of time though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is still better than they've had </v>

1066
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:21.130
<v Speaker 2>historically ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's true for most people.</v>

1067
00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:22.960
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people absolutely lose sight of that.</v>

1068
00:48:22.961 --> 00:48:27.961
<v Speaker 2>It's also less violent now than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically than we've ever been.</v>

1069
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 2>It's ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people forget all that too.</v>

1070
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.970
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1071
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.833
<v Speaker 2>that drives me crazy sometimes because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think people need to maintain that </v>

1072
00:48:37.091 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1073
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1074
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.880
<v Speaker 2>this is not armageddon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1075
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Like shit is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like we're still all right,</v>

1076
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:47.910
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1077
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1078
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.460
<v Speaker 1>what do you make about the Armageddon </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

1079
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.333
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>here all the time is the free speech </v>

1080
00:48:52.951 --> 00:48:53.784
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is going to get a lot </v>

1081
00:48:55.201 --> 00:48:55.890
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1082
00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:56.723
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear that a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people now think it's okay to punch </v>

1083
00:48:59.851 --> 00:49:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Nazis or punch anyone you think might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Nazi.</v>

1084
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.590
<v Speaker 1>And if someone's speaking at a school </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like,</v>

1085
00:49:04.591 --> 00:49:07.440
<v Speaker 1>you can burn down the school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that stuff.</v>

1086
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.633
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do us as the liberals in this </v>

1087
00:49:10.921 --> 00:49:13.410
<v Speaker 1>situation that are supposed to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech,</v>

1088
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.110
<v Speaker 1>what do we do to to come some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people down?</v>

1089
00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I got there yet.</v>

1090
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1091
00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure either because anytime I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be honest.</v>

1092
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:22.893
<v Speaker 2>Anytime that I've tried to like touch on</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of that because I have in some of </v>

1093
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:26.194
<v Speaker 2>my videos I've tried to say things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in line with what we're talking </v>

1094
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:34.471
<v Speaker 2>about right now and they never get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of response that might other videos</v>

1095
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:35.583
<v Speaker 2>just railing on trump or the writer </v>
<v Speaker 2>would ever do everything I've ever said </v>

1096
00:49:38.151 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 2>in any of my videos I believe and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my genuine thoughts.</v>

1097
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.640
<v Speaker 2>But anything that's ever been in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of challenging in that way.</v>

1098
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:46.930
<v Speaker 2>They're always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:49:46.931 --> 00:49:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like I can feel the internet</v>

1100
00:49:49.261 --> 00:49:50.290
<v Speaker 2>and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1101
00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.181
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1102
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:53.650
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to hear all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1103
00:49:53.651 --> 00:49:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Like people just don't want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

1104
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 2>So when I thought the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's supposed to be the tolerance side,</v>

1105
00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.153
<v Speaker 2>I know the tolerant people and see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been that way for my people my </v>

1106
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:05.960
<v Speaker 2>whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

1107
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:11.010
<v Speaker 2>like for years and years I've been very </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of the hypocrisy of liberals who,</v>

1108
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of horror,</v>

1109
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:20.851
<v Speaker 2>any kind of intolerance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination being so openly prejudice</v>

1110
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:22.840
<v Speaker 2>towards people like me.</v>

1111
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's always been that way my whole </v>

1112
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been that way.</v>

1113
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.000
<v Speaker 2>And I've always thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

1114
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:29.834
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you not realize that that is still </v>

1115
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:35.510
<v Speaker 2>that still intolerant and it's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>been that way about,</v>

1116
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor white trash rednecks,</v>

1117
00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:38.423
<v Speaker 2>whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now it's like spreading into this </v>

1118
00:50:40.991 --> 00:50:41.824
<v Speaker 2>psych.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're intolerant of anybody who </v>

1119
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:45.890
<v Speaker 2>doesn't agree with them on every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1120
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 2>You're now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1121
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:50.210
<v Speaker 2>you're a Nazi or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1122
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.470
<v Speaker 2>stoking the fires of the Patriarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this shit because she,</v>

1123
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I assume you were against punching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi,</v>

1124
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put words in your mouth.</v>

1125
00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:57.603
<v Speaker 1>I'm against it.</v>

1126
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take that back.</v>

1127
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a Nazi.</v>

1128
00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Got Punched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like getting punched is fine with me,</v>

1129
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.713
<v Speaker 2>especially if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wish it would have just happened </v>

1130
00:51:10.921 --> 00:51:14.490
<v Speaker 2>in a bar somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just whipped his ass or whatever because</v>

1131
00:51:14.491 --> 00:51:16.610
<v Speaker 2>he probably needs his ass whipped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1132
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.023
<v Speaker 2>but do I think that we need to make it a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where we just go around punching </v>

1133
00:51:22.141 --> 00:51:23.910
<v Speaker 2>people that say things we disagree with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1134
00:51:23.911 --> 00:51:25.710
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if they're Nazis,</v>

1135
00:51:25.711 --> 00:51:26.544
<v Speaker 2>it's like when they sell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you defended the Ku Klux Klan or </v>

1136
00:51:28.741 --> 00:51:29.574
<v Speaker 2>whatever in a court case once over </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech issue and like that's </v>

1137
00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:33.630
<v Speaker 2>the way it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1138
00:51:33.631 --> 00:51:34.860
<v Speaker 2>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1139
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.863
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to hell with the client they held </v>

1140
00:51:37.411 --> 00:51:41.130
<v Speaker 2>with Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we're in Indiana Jones again.</v>

1141
00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I know it's ridiculous like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has,</v>

1142
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.250
<v Speaker 2>it has to go both ways.</v>

1143
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is slightly different subject,</v>

1144
00:51:49.321 --> 00:51:52.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's like on the topic of what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>and is not okay to joke about.</v>

1145
00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:55.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like Trey Parker and Matt Stone set</v>
<v Speaker 2>on South Park.</v>

1146
00:51:55.321 --> 00:51:56.640
<v Speaker 2>They tackled it and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1147
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.490
<v Speaker 2>either all of it's okay or none of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1148
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I feel about free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>

1149
00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:04.950
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have to like the awful </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that he's saying,</v>

1150
00:52:04.951 --> 00:52:07.920
<v Speaker 2>but this is America and he has the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say it.</v>

1151
00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:08.843
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like we have the right to say I </v>

1152
00:52:10.111 --> 00:52:10.944
<v Speaker 2>have the right man because I asked them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd go after a shitty white </v>

1153
00:52:14.641 --> 00:52:17.910
<v Speaker 2>people as that termed them hard all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1154
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1155
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.490
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't have the ability to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be sitting here right now.</v>

1156
00:52:23.491 --> 00:52:25.320
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have a career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just be doing whatever else.</v>

1157
00:52:25.321 --> 00:52:26.154
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1158
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:27.023
<v Speaker 2>I realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not going to be hypocritical </v>

1159
00:52:28.981 --> 00:52:30.120
<v Speaker 2>inside that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1160
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:33.930
<v Speaker 2>only I should have the right to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm right and he's wrong.</v>

1161
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:36.870
<v Speaker 2>But what I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course I believe that he's wrong,</v>

1162
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.910
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it works.</v>

1163
00:52:38.911 --> 00:52:41.220
<v Speaker 2>You have to apply it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1164
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.540
<v Speaker 2>across the board consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you have to have ideals</v>

1165
00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:47.240
<v Speaker 2>even when they're hard to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:47.941
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1167
00:52:47.941 --> 00:52:48.774
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many years you've been doing </v>

1168
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.090
<v Speaker 2>standup?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six and a half.</v>

1169
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Six and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1170
00:52:52.251 --> 00:52:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I did 12 years of stand up before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got into all this.</v>

1171
00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.253
<v Speaker 1>I started doing all this crazy shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you before how I got to </v>

1172
00:52:58.371 --> 00:52:59.204
<v Speaker 1>start doing it again now and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking to colleges and stuff and sort </v>

1173
00:53:01.351 --> 00:53:02.184
<v Speaker 1>of working some standup in because I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such a need for people to say </v>

1174
00:53:05.781 --> 00:53:07.160
<v Speaker 1>some uncomfortable things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm curious.</v>

1175
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:07.994
<v Speaker 1>In your six and a half years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen the way language has </v>

1176
00:53:09.981 --> 00:53:10.814
<v Speaker 1>changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there something that you might've </v>

1177
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:12.583
<v Speaker 1>said six years ago that you think now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because everyone's on twitter and </v>

1178
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 1>snapchat and your whole set and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>

1179
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you'd be afraid of saying</v>

1180
00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 2>it's hard as a comedian and sit here </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of that.</v>

1181
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of saying anything but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

1182
00:53:28.321 --> 00:53:30.950
<v Speaker 2>like one thing that bothers me is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm doing,</v>

1183
00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:31.803
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I still do a lot of this and I can </v>

1184
00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 2>feel people pull back sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but usually it's so it's okay,</v>

1185
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:39.770
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm doing a bit about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1186
00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.270
<v Speaker 2>that shitty people do or believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1187
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:43.104
<v Speaker 2>And so like in the bit I'm talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hypothetical racist or bigoted or </v>

1188
00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like you say,</v>

1189
00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if it's a homophobic thing and you </v>

1190
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 2>in the bit I say queer or gay or Faggot </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>

1191
00:53:57.631 --> 00:54:00.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's not me saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about this guy saying it and</v>

1192
00:54:00.001 --> 00:54:03.480
<v Speaker 2>then I tear that do apart right after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for being shitty.</v>

1193
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.170
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't matter to a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>just having said the word,</v>

1194
00:54:07.171 --> 00:54:08.160
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1195
00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:09.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you do that?</v>

1196
00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:13.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not listening to me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to sugarcoat things and act</v>

1197
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:15.750
<v Speaker 2>like that's not how those people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1198
00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what that hypothetical dude would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1199
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's the whole point of this whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit or whatever.</v>

1200
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:22.493
<v Speaker 2>But none of that matters to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that matters is literally just the </v>

1201
00:54:25.021 --> 00:54:26.820
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the buzz words or whatever.</v>

1202
00:54:26.821 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's like buzz ideas or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1203
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:32.940
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just not allowed to joke about or</v>

1204
00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:35.180
<v Speaker 2>talk about no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1205
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.550
<v Speaker 2>absolutely hate that.</v>

1206
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And that that's the death of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because need satire.</v>

1207
00:54:39.821 --> 00:54:44.710
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying to sat tire something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to point out hypocrisy or whatever,</v>

1208
00:54:44.711 --> 00:54:45.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1209
00:54:45.251 --> 00:54:46.580
<v Speaker 1>the Charlie Hebdo people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

1210
00:54:46.581 --> 00:54:50.410
<v Speaker 1>well they were mocking Muhammad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were mocking extremists actually.</v>

1211
00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:52.540
<v Speaker 1>And there in lies the rub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do a bit about,</v>

1212
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the transformers before they were </v>

1213
00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:56.890
<v Speaker 1>the movies from the eighties </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformers,</v>

1214
00:54:56.891 --> 00:54:58.420
<v Speaker 1>how they were all different racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1215
00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.850
<v Speaker 1>And I used to act out a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jazz.</v>

1216
00:55:00.851 --> 00:55:01.684
<v Speaker 1>He was the one black transformative to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say the n word on onstage and it would </v>

1217
00:55:04.571 --> 00:55:05.404
<v Speaker 1>always get a huge laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember one time that it got it </v>

1218
00:55:09.101 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 1>suddenly got a grown from a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of the crowd.</v>

1219
00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:11.950
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1220
00:55:11.951 --> 00:55:12.784
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to tell that joke again </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have no desire to say then where </v>

1221
00:55:15.571 --> 00:55:18.010
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just me acting out this fictional</v>

1222
00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:18.963
<v Speaker 1>robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>futuristic robot that doesn't exist but </v>

1223
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 1>satire and this is</v>

1224
00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:24.883
<v Speaker 2>gotten better for me for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because most people at my shows in </v>

1225
00:55:27.321 --> 00:55:29.170
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sort of know what I'm about,</v>

1226
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.530
<v Speaker 2>know what they're getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

1227
00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:32.510
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this accent,</v>

1228
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you literally can't even say black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1229
00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.380
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black people,</v>

1230
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:38.780
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus,</v>

1231
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.730
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is about to be terrible.</v>

1232
00:55:40.731 --> 00:55:41.564
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people immediately recoil because </v>

1233
00:55:43.011 --> 00:55:44.870
<v Speaker 2>of just the way it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1234
00:55:44.871 --> 00:55:45.704
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely dealt with that kind of </v>

1235
00:55:46.491 --> 00:55:50.030
<v Speaker 2>thing and one a and one of my first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my earliest videos,</v>

1236
00:55:50.031 --> 00:55:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was acting out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my great,</v>

1237
00:55:53.691 --> 00:55:56.540
<v Speaker 2>great grandmother know who's dead and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1238
00:55:56.541 --> 00:55:57.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's dead,</v>

1239
00:55:57.201 --> 00:55:58.034
<v Speaker 2>but if she was still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wouldn't be comfortable eating </v>

1240
00:56:00.831 --> 00:56:03.380
<v Speaker 2>cornbread next to a colored boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1241
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Because she wouldn't even colored boys </v>
<v Speaker 2>is cleaning it up,</v>

1242
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1243
00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:08.853
<v Speaker 2>That's what she would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like closer to it and I still </v>

1244
00:56:12.141 --> 00:56:14.030
<v Speaker 2>got so many messages from people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

1245
00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.193
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this or maybe </v>

1246
00:56:15.861 --> 00:56:18.820
<v Speaker 2>it's different in Tennessee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't really say anymore.</v>

1247
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.673
<v Speaker 2>That kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1248
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking course.</v>

1249
00:56:20.841 --> 00:56:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's the point of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>

1250
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:27.670
<v Speaker 2>that it's this antiquated out of date </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal that she would have,</v>

1251
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 2>and I'm making fun of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just the word just calling,</v>

1252
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.950
<v Speaker 2>referring to a black person as colored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter the context,</v>

1253
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.380
<v Speaker 2>set some people off and it's that whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude.</v>

1254
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:42.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like that is the reason that so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people hate liberals</v>

1255
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 1>is that kind of thing because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous how.</v>

1256
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:50.050
<v Speaker 1>What about the idea that so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make that joke about your great,</v>

1257
00:56:50.051 --> 00:56:50.884
<v Speaker 1>great grandpa and that people now look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at historical figures and try to give </v>

1258
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 1>them the morality of 2017 like I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess.</v>

1259
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would guess your great,</v>

1260
00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:01.890
<v Speaker 1>great grandmother probably was a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent one.</v>

1261
00:57:01.891 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 1>One and raised some kids and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1262
00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:04.391
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1263
00:57:04.391 --> 00:57:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were some racial stuff there too,</v>

1264
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:07.144
<v Speaker 1>which decided that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we suddenly give our morality </v>

1265
00:57:09.341 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 1>of today to everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really dangerous thing to do,</v>

1266
00:57:12.791 --> 00:57:13.170
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1267
00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:14.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a doubt that that's another </v>

1268
00:57:14.941 --> 00:57:16.350
<v Speaker 2>thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like um,</v>

1269
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:17.993
<v Speaker 2>that's a big reason why I try to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more like understanding or I'm </v>

1270
00:57:21.121 --> 00:57:21.954
<v Speaker 2>not just so immediately like I'll fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to people on the far right or </v>

1271
00:57:25.711 --> 00:57:29.550
<v Speaker 2>whatever because I've known so many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and loved them.</v>

1272
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:31.140
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my grandparents,</v>

1273
00:57:31.141 --> 00:57:34.860
<v Speaker 2>both my grandfathers are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they were here though,</v>

1274
00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.680
<v Speaker 2>they probably would have voted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

1275
00:57:37.681 --> 00:57:38.514
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the shit out of both of my </v>

1276
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:42.060
<v Speaker 2>grandpas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss them all the time,</v>

1277
00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.880
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like people just shouldn't be,</v>

1278
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:48.150
<v Speaker 2>but they were from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're from a different time,</v>

1279
00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:49.043
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they weren't bad people but like </v>

1280
00:57:50.791 --> 00:57:53.070
<v Speaker 2>both of them and the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1281
00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:57.630
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like that was just,</v>

1282
00:57:57.631 --> 00:57:58.464
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just how people talked when they </v>

1283
00:58:00.421 --> 00:58:01.254
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were growing up over their </v>

1284
00:58:01.921 --> 00:58:02.400
<v Speaker 2>lives or whatever.</v>

1285
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time it was just a true </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

1286
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.300
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is in my book too,</v>

1287
00:58:06.301 --> 00:58:07.134
<v Speaker 2>but there was a fight between a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid and a black kid in the town down </v>

1288
00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.393
<v Speaker 2>town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the town square of Salon in my </v>

1289
00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:15.780
<v Speaker 2>hometown when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small town.</v>

1290
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:16.643
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's talking about it because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>white kid got the shit beat out of it </v>

1291
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:20.303
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was talking about it and so I </v>

1292
00:58:22.321 --> 00:58:26.850
<v Speaker 2>was at my grandpa's car lot the next day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he asked me what was that about,</v>

1293
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.320
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1294
00:58:28.321 --> 00:58:28.921
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1295
00:58:28.921 --> 00:58:29.754
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1296
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:34.080
<v Speaker 2>I think Jimmy called Jimmy called the n </v>
<v Speaker 2>word or something,</v>

1297
00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:36.210
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My grandpa goes,</v>

1298
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:37.543
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you want him to call </v>

1299
00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:42.270
<v Speaker 2>him Chinese?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1300
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.090
<v Speaker 2>here's I loved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1301
00:58:44.091 --> 00:58:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like it was,</v>

1302
00:58:45.331 --> 00:58:47.780
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't trying to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't trying to,</v>

1303
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1304
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:52.980
<v Speaker 2>that was his genuine first thought and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1305
00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:53.843
<v Speaker 2>he's just a product of his time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how so and that my grandpa was </v>

1306
00:58:56.401 --> 00:58:57.234
<v Speaker 2>born in 1935.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you start talking about people </v>

1307
00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:02.670
<v Speaker 2>in the 18 hundreds or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1308
00:59:02.671 --> 00:59:05.910
<v Speaker 2>trying to apply today's standards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them is ridiculous.</v>

1309
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.823
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1310
00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:07.813
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever get it the other way where </v>

1311
00:59:08.781 --> 00:59:09.614
<v Speaker 1>you'll say something about redneck </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and people that are still part </v>

1312
00:59:13.461 --> 00:59:14.860
<v Speaker 1>of that culture will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1313
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.863
<v Speaker 1>you're making us all look like idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you making us all look backwards or </v>

1314
00:59:18.231 --> 00:59:19.064
<v Speaker 1>whatever?</v>

1315
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a of,</v>

1316
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:23.540
<v Speaker 2>and especially in my hometown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot of,</v>

1317
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's selling his people out like that.</v>

1318
00:59:27.051 --> 00:59:32.051
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like exploiting them for like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gimmick or whatever,</v>

1319
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a gimmick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1320
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.580
<v Speaker 2>it is who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't look at it that way at all.</v>

1321
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody that grew up with me should know</v>

1322
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:40.910
<v Speaker 2>better because as we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

1323
00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:44.390
<v Speaker 2>like I've always been this guy that none</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them shouldn't be surprised by this.</v>

1324
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.450
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I get a lot of that.</v>

1325
00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:48.284
<v Speaker 2>But now I remember what I said earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>about rednecks and not giving a damn </v>

1326
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Speaker 2>what people think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get much of like,</v>

1327
00:59:53.481 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you shouldn't be making fun of me,</v>

1328
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:56.151
<v Speaker 2>my own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1329
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:57.830
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll just get like,</v>

1330
00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:03.100
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not in a like they're not,</v>

1331
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.790
<v Speaker 2>not in the wet.</v>

1332
01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a queer to not,</v>

1333
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.160
<v Speaker 2>not in the way that they're offended by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the redneck jokes.</v>

1334
01:00:10.161 --> 01:00:13.220
<v Speaker 2>They're offended by my ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1335
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about it.</v>

1336
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't really get a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1337
01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.320
<v Speaker 2>you're going to solve look by eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they genuinely,</v>

1338
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:21.140
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give a shit how they look to other</v>

1339
01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:21.974
<v Speaker 2>groups of people or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all this really show how </v>

1340
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:28.250
<v Speaker 2>important comedy is to almost everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you look at,</v>

1341
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 2>at foxworthy and those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the redneck comedy tour,</v>

1342
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:32.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it's called,</v>

1343
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.100
<v Speaker 2>blue collar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue collar comedy tour.</v>

1344
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1345
01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:39.500
<v Speaker 2>that was finally an outlet for some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that we're talking about,</v>

1346
01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:40.334
<v Speaker 2>to just have their shit hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just an incredibly powerful </v>

1347
01:00:44.331 --> 01:00:45.081
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1348
01:00:45.081 --> 01:00:45.741
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1349
01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:46.574
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree and totally think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that comedy is more important now than </v>

1350
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:50.990
<v Speaker 2>it's been in a long time.</v>

1351
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:52.560
<v Speaker 2>A weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1352
01:00:52.561 --> 01:00:53.301
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1353
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:54.134
<v Speaker 2>I didn't check this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just in the middle of another </v>

1354
01:00:55.101 --> 01:00:59.530
<v Speaker 2>interview for a UK magazine and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to this,</v>

1355
01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 2>a British reporter and she was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1356
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:06.620
<v Speaker 2>she asked me a question apparently </v>
<v Speaker 2>Armando Iannucci,</v>

1357
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:07.454
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that his iep for vape and he made a in </v>

1358
01:01:09.921 --> 01:01:11.990
<v Speaker 2>the loop the movie and before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UK,</v>

1359
01:01:11.991 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 2>the thick of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of that guy,</v>

1360
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:18.470
<v Speaker 2>colossal fanny's when my favorite comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>writers on planet Earth and she just.</v>

1361
01:01:18.471 --> 01:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you hear what he said the other day?</v>

1362
01:01:20.181 --> 01:01:21.014
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was news over there or </v>

1363
01:01:22.821 --> 01:01:23.654
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said that according to her he </v>

1364
01:01:26.361 --> 01:01:27.194
<v Speaker 2>said that he thinks that it's time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>step away from joking about a lot of </v>

1365
01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:38.090
<v Speaker 2>these things because we need to take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously and not joke about it.</v>

1366
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.920
<v Speaker 2>And I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1367
01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:40.754
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still love his work and I'm a huge </v>

1368
01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:44.444
<v Speaker 2>fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could not possibly disagree more </v>

1369
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:47.790
<v Speaker 2>strongly with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're talking about,</v>

1370
01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a comedy writer,</v>

1371
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:51.434
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's my whole job is to make fun </v>

1372
01:01:54.651 --> 01:01:55.484
<v Speaker 2>of Shit and I think you need comedy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>times like this because it otherwise </v>

1373
01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:00.584
<v Speaker 2>it's just darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it easier to deal with because </v>

1374
01:02:03.641 --> 01:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1375
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.133
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1376
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.950
<v Speaker 2>people do need to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

1377
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:12.370
<v Speaker 2>The people like politicians and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually in the field or whatever.</v>

1378
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 2>They do need to take this shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

1379
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.390
<v Speaker 2>They absolutely do because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious.</v>

1380
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.300
<v Speaker 2>But I'm a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to take it.</v>

1381
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.580
<v Speaker 2>That's not my role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My role is to take the piss out of it,</v>

1382
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1383
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.720
<v Speaker 2>his vernacular and like I don't know why</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would stop now.</v>

1384
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.870
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more important now than ever it is.</v>

1385
01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:32.670
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he,</v>

1386
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.350
<v Speaker 2>if he didn't actually say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

1387
01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.213
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to click and send it </v>

1388
01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 2>directly to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But according to a British reporter,</v>

1389
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:43.440
<v Speaker 2>that was a quote from him and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just kind of floored,</v>

1390
01:02:43.441 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1391
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:45.630
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not opposite.</v>

1392
01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're comics,</v>

1393
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean people that I generally respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like where they've gone off the deep</v>

1394
01:02:52.261 --> 01:02:53.520
<v Speaker 2>end where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1395
01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:55.490
<v Speaker 2>they're not being funny anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1396
01:02:55.491 --> 01:02:59.070
<v Speaker 2>they're just preaching all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like if George Carlin was around,</v>

1397
01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 2>and I say this on the show almost every </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

1398
01:03:00.421 --> 01:03:01.830
<v Speaker 2>like every morning I wake up and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1399
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:03.070
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the hell is George Carlin?</v>

1400
01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:06.840
<v Speaker 2>And when we need it more than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would still be being funny about this</v>

1401
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:07.630
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>

1402
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 2>And that goes to prove your point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need.</v>

1403
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1404
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did it.</v>

1405
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:15.560
<v Speaker 2>We did a New Yorker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>La guy and a redneck.</v>

1406
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:17.520
<v Speaker 2>We did an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has been an hour.</v>

1407
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look down once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even stop.</v>

1408
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.230
<v Speaker 2>We said we were going to stop once we </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolled right through.</v>

1409
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flew by.</v>

1410
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:23.963
<v Speaker 2>It flew by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling we're going to cross </v>

1411
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:26.580
<v Speaker 2>paths again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1412
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so too.</v>
