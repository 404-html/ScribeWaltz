1
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.353
<v Speaker 1>I want to start this week off by abiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>by one of the rules that I set up when </v>

2
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>we launched this operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that if you guys fact check me,</v>

3
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:09.324
<v Speaker 1>I would address it on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did actually make a minor error last </v>

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.231
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

5
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:14.064
<v Speaker 1>while talking to my guest marginalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mistakenly said that Ben Carson was a </v>

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientist when in fact he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurosurgeon.</v>

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>A that was really just a slip of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue,</v>

8
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>but a couple of you called me out on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to correct myself.</v>

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

10
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>whether he's a neuroscientist or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurosurgeon,</v>

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>one thing I hope he will not become </v>
<v Speaker 1>president of the United States.</v>

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>We've got a really great response to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview with Magii last week.</v>

13
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we finished,</v>

14
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

15
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>we had been part of an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that needs to be had more.</v>

16
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.743
<v Speaker 1>This of course is the irony of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressives that bash people like Majid </v>

17
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:46.384
<v Speaker 1>and Sam Harris here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have two people from very different </v>

18
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>walks of life trying to promote secular </v>
<v Speaker 1>values and coexistence.</v>

19
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Whether you agree with them or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on every point is totally irrelevant.</v>

20
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:56.814
<v Speaker 1>It should be obvious to anyone with half</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brain that these are the guys trying </v>

21
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>to find a peaceful way forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take my word for it.</v>

22
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>They'll listen to them speak themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

23
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you can disagree with them on where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand on certain issues,</v>

24
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>yet acknowledged that they're having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult dialogue,</v>

25
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:12.474
<v Speaker 1>unexplainably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heated topics that most people are </v>

26
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>completely afraid to have in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

27
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>When a journalist called modular porch </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey and Sam a racist,</v>

28
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:20.214
<v Speaker 1>it exposes who the real extremists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in case you missed it on Friday nights </v>

29
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.723
<v Speaker 1>realtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher had an excellent sit down </v>

30
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>with Richard Dawkins on this new split </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left.</v>

31
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.793
<v Speaker 1>I was thrilled to hear Bill Maher </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually use the phrase regressive </v>

32
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>leftist bill credited Sam Harris for </v>
<v Speaker 1>coining the phrase though,</v>

33
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Majid was using it as far back as 2012.</v>

34
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.863
<v Speaker 1>In any event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it trickled up to bill </v>

35
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.534
<v Speaker 1>shows you that the discussions we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having here on the show as well as the </v>

36
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:45.684
<v Speaker 1>ones that you guys are having on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and youtube are actually making a </v>

37
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the beauty of the Internet.</v>

38
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>You can get issues to actually bubble up</v>
<v Speaker 1>until mainstream takes notice.</v>

39
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.153
<v Speaker 1>There is evidence of the awakening that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about all over the </v>

40
00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.184
<v Speaker 1>place right now on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone asked me if by calling these </v>

41
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.184
<v Speaker 1>people the regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm just resorting to the same type </v>

42
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>of name calling that we accuse them of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my answer to,</v>

43
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:08.514
<v Speaker 1>this is a hundred percent no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're giving a name to a problem we've </v>

44
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>all seen growing for a long time.</v>

45
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.703
<v Speaker 1>Now we can debate with them on facts if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they accept facts as such and not just </v>

46
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>cherry pick them when suitable for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

47
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.483
<v Speaker 1>The reason I feel like naming them is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important is because I now view these </v>

48
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>regressives as the left's version of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tea party.</v>

49
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>The tea party went unchecked by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right until it was too late,</v>

50
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>and now the Republican Party is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fractured mess,</v>

51
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>often only held together by its worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

52
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.603
<v Speaker 1>I really believe these regressives are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this to the left and if we don't </v>

53
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:38.994
<v Speaker 1>have the courage to stop them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a year or two from now will wonder </v>

54
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>why our system is even screwed up more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it is now.</v>

55
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.743
<v Speaker 1>That's why talking about all this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>is important and that's why we're going </v>

56
00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>to continue to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With that out of the way,</v>

57
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>it's time to sit down with the outspoken</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breitbart,</v>

58
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>conservative Milo Yiannopoulos and fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

59
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I won't let any of his sif like logic </v>
<v Speaker 1>screw with my thinking.</v>

60
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.353
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is a writer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Breitbart Dot Com and a general rabble </v>

61
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>rouser and renaissance men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos.</v>

62
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks so much for having me.</v>

63
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So when I tweeted out originally that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were coming in,</v>

64
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>half the people told me I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely hate you.</v>

65
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Half the people told me I was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love you for wrong.</v>

66
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>They're the first half or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so uh,</v>

68
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>so we actually had a drink the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

69
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.123
<v Speaker 1>We want to be totally transparent here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a drink the other night and we </v>

70
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:27.454
<v Speaker 1>talked a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've gotten to know each other </v>

71
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:33.421
<v Speaker 1>however much you can in an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are a gay conservative now.</v>

72
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I want to repeat that just so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience can be clear.</v>

73
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>You are a gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you need to repeat anything?</v>

74
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservative people.</v>

75
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.650
<v Speaker 1>People will be strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>people freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just start.</v>

77
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's just start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a conservative to you in 2015?</v>

78
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Because I think people don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of basic terms anymore,</v>

79
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.580
<v Speaker 1>much less the gay part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just.</v>

80
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.513
<v Speaker 1>What is a concern?</v>

81
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.003
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason people surprised </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a gay conservative is because we </v>

82
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:00.144
<v Speaker 2>have a slightly outdated notion of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism is now in the religious </v>

83
00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:04.584
<v Speaker 2>right in America doesn't have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>purchase on the public imagination </v>

84
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:06.954
<v Speaker 2>anymore that it wants did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a sort of part of the ripe but </v>

85
00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:11.850
<v Speaker 2>not hold of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the rice in Europe is drifting quite</v>

86
00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:14.790
<v Speaker 2>quickly to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So conservatism as a movement,</v>

87
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:16.770
<v Speaker 2>as political philosophy is a bit lost at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

88
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.843
<v Speaker 2>One thing we can say for sure is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on both sides of the political </v>

89
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:23.310
<v Speaker 2>spectrum are moving toward a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>center right libertarianism,</v>

90
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.470
<v Speaker 2>and for me the big gap between people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big sort of defining political,</v>

91
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 2>a schism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly on the Internet,</v>

92
00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 2>but I think if everybody really is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right anymore,</v>

93
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:35.280
<v Speaker 2>it's becoming between authoritarians and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians.</v>

94
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>The issue for the left being that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't much space for Libertarians,</v>

95
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.953
<v Speaker 2>they're conservatives who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly very religious or find their </v>

96
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:44.424
<v Speaker 2>own party drifting to the left are </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning to call themselves </v>

97
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 2>conservative or began to call themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians or conservator Darien.</v>

98
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:51.774
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction to talk speak in terms of </v>

99
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 2>personal liberty and freedom now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you understand it like that,</v>

100
00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>it makes much more sense why a gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>person would be one.</v>

101
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.423
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the part that we sort of fall out on </v>

102
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:02.934
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the same spot is the authoritarian </v>

103
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>and libertarian part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

104
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians.</v>

105
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I think both of us are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarians,</v>

106
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>libertarians are thought more of in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative space,</v>

107
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.773
<v Speaker 1>but if you were to give me like a three </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence synopsis of when you say to </v>

108
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a conservative,</v>

109
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.750
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the principles there?</v>

110
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

111
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>what is the basic bullet principles?</v>

112
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I think you believe in individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal responsibility.</v>

113
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 2>You believe in freedom of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of expression,</v>

114
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 2>of creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe in free markets.</v>

115
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:32.074
<v Speaker 2>You believe that the relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual in the state should be </v>

116
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 2>circumscribed quite clearly and quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisply.</v>

117
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.893
<v Speaker 2>So you believe that state has a limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>and quite well defined set of </v>

118
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities beyond which it should </v>
<v Speaker 2>not stretch.</v>

119
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.713
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe in the power and value of </v>

120
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 2>institutional authority and community </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>

121
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 2>So you believe that even if you may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

122
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 2>believe that even if you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian,</v>

123
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.273
<v Speaker 2>you still recognize that the church has </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to offer that is a valuable </v>

124
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 2>institution that keeps up kids that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to that.</v>

125
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 2>But likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions like monarchy,</v>

126
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>you respect them because you understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that even though,</v>

127
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be very difficult to defend the</v>

128
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 2>monarchy in purely logistical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

129
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>purely a logical terms these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

130
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 2>it works best in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the best system yet devised and it</v>

131
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>works brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impression,</v>

132
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 2>even if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were to design a state today,</v>

133
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't come up with it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider a lot of the commenters.</v>

134
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Are we on the wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously wrong.</v>

135
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.873
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives instinctively understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the value of tradition and </v>

136
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:28.664
<v Speaker 2>authority and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course levels wants to tear all </v>

137
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:32.144
<v Speaker 2>those things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think those are some of the things </v>

138
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 2>that people mean when they describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as conservative.</v>

139
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I think it's,</v>

140
00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a confusing term or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all our terms have become confusing,</v>

141
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I think is because a lot of times now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you sort of alluded to in America,</v>

142
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>we think of conservatives somehow as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attachment to the religious right,</v>

143
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>which is weakening a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is good.</v>

144
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.063
<v Speaker 1>And you're saying in in England it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little more of a respect for the </v>

145
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>monarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monarchy has respect for traditions,</v>

146
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

147
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>you're just in it for the man,</v>

148
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

149
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the,</v>

150
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.560
<v Speaker 2>look at how many working class </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative voters there are,</v>

151
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.680
<v Speaker 2>why would all of these people be voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>against their own interests if that were</v>

152
00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:09.514
<v Speaker 2>true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if conservatism are really about </v>

153
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:11.164
<v Speaker 2>protecting rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would millions of of people who </v>

154
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:14.614
<v Speaker 2>struggle to make rent or struggle to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids through college or struggle </v>

155
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 2>even perhaps to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

156
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 2>to feed their families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote conservative.</v>

157
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 2>They do it because they appreciate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>value of,</v>

158
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.770
<v Speaker 2>of some of the structures around that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they love and they do it because they,</v>

159
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.820
<v Speaker 2>they believe in a certain limited the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state's power.</v>

160
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:32.610
<v Speaker 2>They believe in other things that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>with conservatism.</v>

161
00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:33.444
<v Speaker 2>You why would so many people vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>against their interest and it's just </v>

162
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.513
<v Speaker 2>absurd characterization of childish </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterization of conservatism to </v>

163
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:40.444
<v Speaker 2>suggest that it is in some way just </v>
<v Speaker 2>assist them to protect them and protect </v>

164
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:43.684
<v Speaker 2>the Richard protect corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can all agree that </v>

165
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:48.010
<v Speaker 2>corporatism and I'm mature late </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism,</v>

166
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.533
<v Speaker 2>which existence of intricate symbiosis </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the private sector and in some </v>

167
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:56.140
<v Speaker 2>cases quite poisonous in that respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bailout of the banks in the UK,</v>

168
00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 2>the sorts of corporate cronyism it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens in America.</v>

169
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Plenty of it here too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

170
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:01.870
<v Speaker 2>If course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we all agree that's a bad thing,</v>

171
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:04.540
<v Speaker 2>but it is by no means restricted to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the political spectrum.</v>

172
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

173
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I always say there's a reason that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least in America,</v>

174
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one percent give basically 51 </v>

175
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:10.784
<v Speaker 1>percent of the Republicans and 49 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent to the Democrats because </v>

176
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hedging their bets.</v>

177
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it goes down to either</v>

178
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.860
<v Speaker 2>already know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

179
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

180
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.153
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take the view that conservatism </v>

181
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:21.074
<v Speaker 2>is about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

182
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sticking out for the man,</v>

183
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:24.584
<v Speaker 2>you have to explain things like why </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives give more money to </v>

184
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:26.894
<v Speaker 2>charity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why even conservatives who aren't </v>

185
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:29.534
<v Speaker 2>religious give more charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of very difficult </v>

186
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:32.054
<v Speaker 2>questions you have to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to make that argument for </v>

187
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't hold water.</v>

188
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.260
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

189
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.100
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of where I wanted to jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>off from and just get a basic,</v>

190
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.810
<v Speaker 1>a basic set of rules that were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about here and I think we,</v>

191
00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I think we sorted it not remotely the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most interesting thing about it.</v>

192
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

193
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Well now we're going to get into some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interesting stuff.</v>

194
00:08:48.331 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 1>So first thing I want to ask you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

195
00:08:49.831 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I think I found out about you originally</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of Gamer Gate that I've done one</v>

196
00:08:54.421 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>video on gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about a year ago and so basically</v>

197
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I said to the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

198
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.141
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

199
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand this thing.</v>

200
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.503
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a sense it has to do with some </v>

201
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:06.564
<v Speaker 1>people that were upset at some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>publications and then all this doxing </v>

202
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>and all and massage and yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

203
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

204
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know that I can address it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're in the thick of this thing.</v>

205
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.970
<v Speaker 1>So I thought if we do one thing I gained</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

206
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 1>can we do like a five minute really hash</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out?</v>

207
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.023
<v Speaker 1>Honest</v>

208
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 2>what Gamergate was really about five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes for you.</v>

209
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 2>We're all used to seeing these social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors to police language.</v>

210
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:30.980
<v Speaker 2>You say that</v>

211
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.080
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do plenty on that.</v>

212
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Very random things or sexist or racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>or misogynist or whatever.</v>

213
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm the press in some cases,</v>

214
00:09:40.391 --> 00:09:42.400
<v Speaker 2>reporting on things extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly now.</v>

215
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.263
<v Speaker 2>Gamergate has been a huge controversy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people who care about these things </v>

216
00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:46.390
<v Speaker 2>because both of those things have come </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

217
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.500
<v Speaker 2>It is a consumer movement that rejects </v>
<v Speaker 2>sloppy standards in,</v>

218
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.070
<v Speaker 2>in reporting about video games and video</v>
<v Speaker 2>games by the way,</v>

219
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.990
<v Speaker 2>are very important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment industry.</v>

220
00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:57.640
<v Speaker 2>They're bigger than Hollywood now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 97,</v>

221
00:09:57.641 --> 00:09:59.590
<v Speaker 2>90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably about by now $90,000,000,000</v>

222
00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:00.424
<v Speaker 2>industry rejects sloppy reporting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and all sorts of horrible </v>

223
00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 2>infractions of journalistic ethics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicts of interest.</v>

224
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Almost it.</v>

225
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.553
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to stay on that though for a </v>

226
00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:07.754
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically the game companies were </v>

227
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:12.080
<v Speaker 1>sort of paying the writers to give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>better reviews.</v>

228
00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:12.914
<v Speaker 1>Is that</v>

229
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.483
<v Speaker 2>things like that going on if 10 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping with people and writing things </v>

230
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 2>about them a bit too closely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't have.</v>

231
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very fast growing industry,</v>

232
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.423
<v Speaker 2>so the presses nascent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the presses grown up very fast and what </v>

233
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.230
<v Speaker 2>was previously a trade press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

234
00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:28.064
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree cutters weekly or the stamp </v>

235
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:30.444
<v Speaker 2>collectors monthly or whatever has </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly become a consumer press and it </v>

236
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 2>hasn't necessarily improved it standards</v>
<v Speaker 2>commensurate with that.</v>

237
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 2>The second half of it is the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors who mentioned briefly.</v>

238
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:40.704
<v Speaker 2>There is a sort of insurgent move in </v>
<v Speaker 2>video games from a couple of wacky left </v>

239
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:50.100
<v Speaker 2>wing feminists and these are sort of far</v>
<v Speaker 2>left Israel hating Socialist Weirdos.</v>

240
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm fall a feminist to say that every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every video game is problematic.</v>

241
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 2>That there is something wrong with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these video games and if for some reason</v>

242
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.710
<v Speaker 2>the journalists have sucked all this up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have bought it all in a digit,</v>

243
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the same journalists who protected video</v>
<v Speaker 2>games when the religious right in the 19</v>

244
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:04.914
<v Speaker 2>eighties and nineties said that video </v>
<v Speaker 2>games turn kids into killers and </v>

245
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.650
<v Speaker 2>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which there is no evidence of right.</v>

246
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:11.700
<v Speaker 2>We have one more slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None whatsoever.</v>

247
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.593
<v Speaker 2>None whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

248
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.493
<v Speaker 2>Those same journalists nonetheless have </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolled over and accepted the feminist </v>

249
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>critique of video games and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

250
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games got me get violent,</v>

251
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 2>but they can make you sexist now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

252
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 2>there is no evidence whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the case.</v>

253
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.503
<v Speaker 2>The research is the most generous you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be is to say the research is that </v>

254
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 2>the jury is out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the most,</v>

255
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 2>most of the most credible research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

256
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:34.014
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing</v>

257
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.530
<v Speaker 1>to be real clear on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be like for example,</v>

258
00:11:36.531 --> 00:11:37.364
<v Speaker 1>in a game like grand theft auto where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can literally grab a woman out of </v>

259
00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:43.730
<v Speaker 1>her car hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do that to a man too,</v>

260
00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:44.564
<v Speaker 1>so you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would argue that that that's not </v>

261
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>what the anti woman because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

262
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a festival.</v>

263
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:51.470
<v Speaker 1>It's imaginary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>

264
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

265
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>it's on his computer</v>

266
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 2>screen and second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what much of the evidence shows actually</v>

267
00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:58.663
<v Speaker 2>is that people who get stuff out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their system and it's mainly boys who </v>

268
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:01.714
<v Speaker 2>get the stuff out of their system </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing video games on nicer to people </v>

269
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 2>in the real world because it's that sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of boyish testosterone thing.</v>

270
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:08.014
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even as homosexual is we have some </v>

271
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:12.060
<v Speaker 2>understanding of that male need to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of win and crushed and you know,</v>

272
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.610
<v Speaker 2>and do that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

273
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 2>you probably play sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

275
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:16.490
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

276
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

277
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.430
<v Speaker 2>I take that out horizontally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is,</v>

278
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 2>there is that sort of male need to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:24.190
<v Speaker 2>get that sort of testosterone energy out</v>
<v Speaker 2>for system.</v>

280
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when boys do that in video games,</v>

281
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.770
<v Speaker 2>much of the evidence shows that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave nicer and rural life.</v>

282
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.633
<v Speaker 2>Now some have some studies say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>video games can make you hyper </v>

283
00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:34.120
<v Speaker 2>competitive.</v>

284
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.953
<v Speaker 2>So the FIFA Games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the football games can leave somebody a </v>

285
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 2>bit more competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can raise testosterone levels.</v>

286
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:38.824
<v Speaker 2>But that's a very temporary effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's absolutely no evidence </v>

287
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:42.514
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The video games can make is sexist and </v>

288
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of Cherry picked insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminists.</v>

289
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean just just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the most barmy bunkers,</v>

290
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 2>all of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get onto feminism later,</v>

291
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you imagine the most wacky,</v>

292
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 2>stereotypical blue haired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overweight,</v>

293
00:12:57.461 --> 00:12:58.890
<v Speaker 2>furious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

294
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 2>fact free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible lesbian.</v>

295
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lesbian and a feminist whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbians.</v>

296
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist kind of lunatic.</v>

297
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the sort of person that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing video games.</v>

298
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 2>And very often the people don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>play video games.</v>

299
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:14.614
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is another chapter in the culture </v>

300
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 2>wars which were used to from the movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and from books.</v>

301
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:22.231
<v Speaker 2>And so the gate know game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ordinary gamers have put up for 10 years</v>

302
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:24.904
<v Speaker 2>or more with their own press calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>them man babies and misogynists beating </v>

303
00:13:27.951 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 2>up on them basically because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trendy thing to do because these days,</v>

304
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.850
<v Speaker 2>progressivism and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:35.800
<v Speaker 2>sort of hating on men that kill all </v>
<v Speaker 2>white men,</v>

306
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:39.040
<v Speaker 2>kind of these feminists hashtags are </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially acceptable.</v>

307
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

308
00:13:39.391 --> 00:13:39.701
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

309
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 2>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will get no social censure from your</v>

310
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:43.024
<v Speaker 2>peers as far as a member of the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>today for tweeting one of those </v>

311
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:46.151
<v Speaker 2>hashtags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

312
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:47.340
<v Speaker 2>obviously if you did it the other way </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

313
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.850
<v Speaker 2>it would be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

314
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 2>that's become fashionable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become trendy for White,</v>

315
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.180
<v Speaker 2>sort of white guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

316
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.033
<v Speaker 2>White middle class girls become </v>
<v Speaker 2>fashionable for these people to beat up </v>

317
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 2>on themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prostrate themselves before the altar of</v>

318
00:13:57.701 --> 00:13:58.534
<v Speaker 2>womanhood and say that everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are and everything that they do is </v>

319
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:01.960
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry.</v>

320
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:02.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother guy,</v>

321
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 2>or how can I make it up to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

322
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 2>the reality is that actually these video</v>
<v Speaker 2>games quite good for people.</v>

323
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the crux of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's,</v>

324
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.930
<v Speaker 1>it's these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the gaming community that</v>

325
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 2>that is a risk that has risen up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

326
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.683
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is tired of being lied about and </v>

327
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:17.674
<v Speaker 2>slandered by its own press press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The did a really good job of defending </v>

328
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:20.554
<v Speaker 2>it when the violence stuff is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack Thompson in the nineties were </v>

329
00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:22.811
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

330
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:23.644
<v Speaker 2>it can make you violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The press did a really good job of </v>

331
00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:26.050
<v Speaker 2>rebutting him because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>

332
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:26.811
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

333
00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 2>a liberal and progressive critic comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

334
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 2>they fall over themselves to agree and </v>
<v Speaker 2>start hating on their own audience.</v>

335
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really interesting.</v>

336
00:14:33.811 --> 00:14:34.644
<v Speaker 1>And it goes to really what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of what we're going to talk </v>

337
00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:39.270
<v Speaker 1>to talk about Isabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because right.</v>

338
00:14:39.271 --> 00:14:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Joe Lieberman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

339
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the right at that time,</v>

340
00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:44.244
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's an independent now when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was railing against violence in video </v>

341
00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:50.700
<v Speaker 1>games with mortal Kombat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was very cool to say what,</v>

342
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.020
<v Speaker 1>what loser he was</v>

343
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 2>and so added touch and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

344
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:53.774
<v Speaker 2>the problem with some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with video games from the </v>

345
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.070
<v Speaker 2>gamers is they have no social capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody hates them.</v>

346
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:58.933
<v Speaker 2>The right hates video games because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>says they call a school shootings and </v>

347
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:03.320
<v Speaker 2>because they're violent and a bit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>deviant and Dorky,</v>

348
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.753
<v Speaker 2>and you've got the sort of from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious right that complains that </v>

349
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:08.200
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

350
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.330
<v Speaker 2>can introduce dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

351
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts of,</v>

352
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.893
<v Speaker 2>into people's minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to nobody was killing anybody in the </v>

353
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 2>name of God before video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

354
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I've never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about that.</v>

355
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:19.034
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

356
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.950
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of thing.</v>

357
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serial killers will get up there.</v>

358
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 2>be we're doing this in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

360
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:29.630
<v Speaker 2>And the game's press did a great job of </v>
<v Speaker 2>defending,</v>

361
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.820
<v Speaker 2>defending video games against those </v>
<v Speaker 2>charges.</v>

362
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 2>They've done a much less job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good job.</v>

363
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.113
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done no job at all of defending </v>

364
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:36.524
<v Speaker 2>it against feminists who are just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>wacky and just as crazy as the old </v>

365
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 2>religious right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

366
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 2>the feminists say all the same things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hate the same things they hate.</v>

367
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Nudity and violence are all the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

368
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.350
<v Speaker 2>This is why some very clever Brendan </v>
<v Speaker 2>O'Neill,</v>

369
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 2>who is a wonderful economist and Britain</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote in the spectator.</v>

370
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 2>A great thing about it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>provocation,</v>

371
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:52.844
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting about how feminism </v>

372
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:55.004
<v Speaker 2>looks quite like Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam in some regards there because it </v>

373
00:15:56.151 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 2>hits the same thing it hits female </v>
<v Speaker 2>nudity to and it asks for the same staff</v>

374
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:02.060
<v Speaker 2>and it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uses the same language I wrote,</v>

375
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I did a silly quiz online in my column </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

376
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anita Sarkeesian and was the leading </v>

377
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:09.860
<v Speaker 2>feminist critic of video games or Jack </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thompson who was the nineties.</v>

378
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.693
<v Speaker 2>We'll just write guy and I just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lined up a lot of quotes from each of </v>

379
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 2>them and asked to go in here to pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>which you,</v>

380
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:18.470
<v Speaker 2>who said it and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never got more than five out of 10,</v>

381
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

382
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.980
<v Speaker 2>which is my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

383
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 2>they say the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same language and it goes to that.</v>

384
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.460
<v Speaker 2>That difference is not really about left</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right.</v>

385
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not worry about politics anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most important political distinction</v>

386
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 2>in people since more of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as more of our lives move online,</v>

387
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 2>more of our discourses online as more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people navigate the Internet.</v>

388
00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:37.550
<v Speaker 2>What the Internet has done to politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>is very interesting,</v>

389
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.230
<v Speaker 2>is turned every major culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>war and every major discussion into,</v>

390
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 2>around between authoritarians want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control how other people live,</v>

391
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.583
<v Speaker 2>and Libertarians who either want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>escape into fantasy worlds because they </v>

392
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 2>want to escape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

393
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.093
<v Speaker 2>was going on in their life or simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberals like me who believe </v>

394
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 2>in freedom of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of thought,</v>

395
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 2>liberty of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of idea,</v>

396
00:16:58.161 --> 00:16:58.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

397
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.830
<v Speaker 2>and believe that it is essential for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>good of our species if you like it,</v>

398
00:17:03.831 --> 00:17:06.980
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get serious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can talk about everything openly</v>

399
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 2>and honestly and that there are no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no go areas.</v>

400
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm more what my colleague at Breitbart </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alim Bukhari Cause,</v>

401
00:17:12.481 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cultural libertarian.</v>

402
00:17:13.821 --> 00:17:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a libertarian politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

403
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:15.944
<v Speaker 2>but I believe that in culture there </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be no boundaries and that we </v>

404
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.800
<v Speaker 2>should be able to explore everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

405
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.630
<v Speaker 2>video games are sailed on all sides from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>

406
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:24.900
<v Speaker 2>from the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from everybody,</v>

407
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.753
<v Speaker 2>by people who want to restrict the </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable limits of a creative </v>

408
00:17:29.511 --> 00:17:31.070
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's dangerous.</v>

409
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it's dangerous wherever it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

410
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:33.883
<v Speaker 2>I think video games are the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting entertainment medium in </v>

411
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:37.214
<v Speaker 2>which it's happening now because it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the because gamers are the first people </v>

412
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:40.754
<v Speaker 2>who rose up and said no to the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors and it was a horrible </v>

413
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 2>and humiliating defeat for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

414
00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:45.824
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll move on to feminism </v>

415
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:49.770
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really interesting because this</v>

416
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>is sort</v>

417
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 3>of the awakening that I now see </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in our political discussion.</v>

418
00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:54.504
<v Speaker 3>People are now hitting on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian thing and fighting the </v>

419
00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:58.820
<v Speaker 3>authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

420
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.620
<v Speaker 3>But it's still relate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The machine is</v>

421
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Saunas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's trump,</v>

422
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.533
<v Speaker 2>it's farrage and Corbin in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the populist political movements </v>

423
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:08.094
<v Speaker 2>on the left and the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come from all over the counter </v>

424
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 2>counter cultural antiestablishment </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian leanings.</v>

425
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Right now Corbin in the UK is much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a socialist as much more of a of a of</v>

426
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:19.290
<v Speaker 2>a prescriptive kind of guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his supporters,</v>

427
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be able to behave terribly and </v>

428
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:22.734
<v Speaker 2>they do behave terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just this week there was spitting on </v>

429
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 2>people in the to the Tory conference in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manchester.</v>

430
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:27.564
<v Speaker 2>They want the right not just to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible things like I'd microbes to </v>

431
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 2>cultural image and they want to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to behave abominably.</v>

432
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.080
<v Speaker 2>All of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

433
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.963
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it comes from the thing I think </v>

434
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.750
<v Speaker 2>something we've all known for 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

435
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:40.584
<v Speaker 2>It's increasing dissatisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alienation from the political and media </v>

436
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 2>relates that the lot of ordinary voters </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel ordinary people.</v>

437
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I think pretty much everybody feels that</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of what they do and even,</v>

438
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.323
<v Speaker 2>and I think we'll get onto this later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even those of us who work in the media </v>

439
00:18:53.011 --> 00:18:55.500
<v Speaker 2>and have quite nice lives and come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice homes and you know,</v>

440
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 2>and don't really have much to complain </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

441
00:18:56.881 --> 00:18:57.714
<v Speaker 2>Still feel that quite acutely and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think are examples of people who </v>

442
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:01.374
<v Speaker 2>are a bit more alive to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bit more aware of the fact that you </v>

443
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.413
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that political discourse and cultural </v>

444
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 2>discussion on television has become </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

445
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:11.604
<v Speaker 2>really dull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've had people on your show </v>

446
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.540
<v Speaker 2>already and the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

447
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.413
<v Speaker 2>And you've had people in the old show </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the first three episodes who are </v>

448
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 2>very insistent about free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 2>free expression and the importance of,</v>

449
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 2>of old victorian style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberalism,</v>

450
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:24.234
<v Speaker 2>but also the importance of mischief and </v>
<v Speaker 2>joy and a little bit of fun like </v>

451
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.350
<v Speaker 2>marginal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

452
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.183
<v Speaker 2>marginal monster you had on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure it was a great lover of fun and </v>

453
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 2>mischief and loves to tease people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to lecture him and bullied him.</v>

454
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 2>And in the leftists who say to him that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not a proper Muslim or whatever,</v>

455
00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he doesn't want to pick women in</v>

456
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Burkas or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or what is this?</v>

457
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.160
<v Speaker 3>To me it seems racist if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

458
00:19:40.161 --> 00:19:41.470
<v Speaker 3>he's not being good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

459
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you see,</v>

460
00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.050
<v Speaker 3>we started with Gamergate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did.</v>

461
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 3>We see where we ended here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what they hit us.</v>

462
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then bring it home.</v>

463
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Typically the reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

464
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.280
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

465
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 2>does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Gamergate is,</v>

466
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.580
<v Speaker 2>is the sort of final,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

467
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.970
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like the final chapter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>two decades worth of Internet wars.</v>

468
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.580
<v Speaker 2>And those Internet wars have been about </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought speech,</v>

469
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.630
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

470
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.493
<v Speaker 2>You name it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every community on the Internet and </v>

471
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:07.720
<v Speaker 2>every sub community within those sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which for channel Reddit,</v>

472
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever has a dog in the fight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gamergate because they all either have a</v>

473
00:20:11.891 --> 00:20:12.724
<v Speaker 2>vested interest in free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anonymity or they have an interest in </v>

474
00:20:14.801 --> 00:20:17.440
<v Speaker 2>protecting the integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity,</v>

475
00:20:17.441 --> 00:20:20.240
<v Speaker 2>and creative expression of certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>attainment mediums or their,</v>

476
00:20:20.241 --> 00:20:22.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their individual people who have behaved</v>

477
00:20:22.481 --> 00:20:23.314
<v Speaker 2>terribly on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who saw Gamer Gate is a redemptive </v>

478
00:20:24.881 --> 00:20:26.980
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they lined up with the,</v>

479
00:20:26.981 --> 00:20:27.814
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women and went in with these mostly </v>

480
00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:32.290
<v Speaker 2>fake frets about death and rape and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of it.</v>

481
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it typical leftist feminist tactics that</v>

482
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.770
<v Speaker 2>don't stack up when you look into them </v>
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>

483
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 2>she will get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to challenge me.</v>

484
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.870
<v Speaker 2>A lining up on one side of that debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a way of indicating whether you were</v>

485
00:20:43.871 --> 00:20:44.704
<v Speaker 2>for Authoritarians or libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a sort of confluence of all </v>

486
00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:50.240
<v Speaker 2>of these arguments and wars online and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

487
00:20:50.241 --> 00:20:53.980
<v Speaker 2>and it takes you in these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>directions because in a way it's sort of</v>

488
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:54.814
<v Speaker 2>the most all encompassing a war and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most all encompassing event that's ever </v>

489
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.640
<v Speaker 2>happened on the internet because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought in everybody,</v>

490
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>all of the old battles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

491
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:05.980
<v Speaker 2>something people don't realize is when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you range up the sides on Gamer Gate,</v>

492
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 2>there are people who were involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>was five years ago.</v>

493
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 2>You kind of take picking the same sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sides.</v>

494
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.823
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the best example we have yet </v>

495
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 2>most exciting example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Culturally we haven't journalists.</v>

496
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:16.984
<v Speaker 2>There's on such a terrible idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible job of reporting on this </v>

497
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.590
<v Speaker 2>concentrated these fake rape threats.</v>

498
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives or miss the miss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the huge cultural opportunity here.</v>

499
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm shamefully so leftists have not even</v>
<v Speaker 2>bothered to make the arguments because </v>

500
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 2>they know their arguments in nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they focused on the threats.</v>

501
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 2>This was such an interesting example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was saying earlier,</v>

502
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 2>the fact that on the Internet that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not about left and right anymore.</v>

503
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:37.414
<v Speaker 2>It's about authoritarians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians and cultural libertarians </v>

504
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:42.190
<v Speaker 2>are the rising power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're the people who love me.</v>

505
00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 2>They're the people met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think much of your audience falls into</v>

506
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:45.184
<v Speaker 2>the same bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

507
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the people who love Lauren Southern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the libertarian candidate,</v>

508
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Canadian politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love Cathy Young,</v>

509
00:21:50.191 --> 00:21:51.024
<v Speaker 2>a great veteran journalist of Christina </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hoff summers at the American Enterprise </v>

510
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.501
<v Speaker 2>Institute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam Baldwin,</v>

511
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:55.080
<v Speaker 2>the actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of the,</v>

512
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.073
<v Speaker 2>even Eli Roth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a director is making a movie about </v>

513
00:21:58.241 --> 00:21:59.340
<v Speaker 2>social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where right now,</v>

514
00:21:59.341 --> 00:22:00.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

515
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.053
<v Speaker 2>cultural libertarianism is on the rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people are sick of political </v>

516
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:03.604
<v Speaker 2>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are sick of being told they're </v>

517
00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:04.721
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>

518
00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 2>misogynist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transphobic when they know they're not.</v>

519
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think by asking you about Gabriel,</v>

520
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.550
<v Speaker 3>we just hit on a zillion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hit on a zillion.</v>

521
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the best I can do.</v>

522
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.620
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to leave it there and I'm</v>

523
00:22:15.621 --> 00:22:17.420
<v Speaker 3>sure the commenters are going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>field day with it,</v>

524
00:22:17.421 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let,</v>

525
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.660
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about some other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So feminism,</v>

526
00:22:20.661 --> 00:22:23.000
<v Speaker 3>which you've already enlightened me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit on,</v>

527
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.900
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really are against feminism.</v>

528
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.920
<v Speaker 3>And before I let you do your piece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now my sense is that feminism,</v>

529
00:22:32.421 --> 00:22:36.050
<v Speaker 3>at least the way it started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that women wanted equality.</v>

530
00:22:36.051 --> 00:22:39.170
<v Speaker 3>They wanted the same equality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity that men had.</v>

531
00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:40.950
<v Speaker 3>There is no doubt that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

532
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.200
<v Speaker 3>most of these roads in our society have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been easier for men.</v>

533
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 3>I think you would argue that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed now.</v>

534
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.303
<v Speaker 3>But so what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think of the feminist </v>

535
00:22:51.381 --> 00:22:52.214
<v Speaker 3>movement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were just kicked out of the Amber </v>

536
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Rose sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

537
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.400
<v Speaker 3>two days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in your situation with you today.</v>

538
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.850
<v Speaker 3>We didn't run into him because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>given her a piece of my mind.</v>

539
00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Why would you hate feminists?</v>

540
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:01.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the picture you painted perfectly </v>

541
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:05.200
<v Speaker 2>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least it was until perhaps 10,</v>

542
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe 15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly recently.</v>

543
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.253
<v Speaker 2>It's changed very recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people instinctively agree </v>

544
00:23:10.971 --> 00:23:14.080
<v Speaker 2>with the equality of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course you have access for women.</v>

545
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.060
<v Speaker 2>They want women to have the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do anything.</v>

546
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:16.894
<v Speaker 2>They want to rise as high as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're prepared to work as hard and </v>

547
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 2>put the same amount of hours in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course I agree with that.</v>

548
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:22.504
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody agrees with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what modern intersectional </v>

549
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:27.190
<v Speaker 2>third wave as it's called feminism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

550
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.550
<v Speaker 2>which seems to me and I think to a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of women,</v>

551
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:34.510
<v Speaker 2>to primarily to be about man hating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a very angry,</v>

552
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.500
<v Speaker 2>bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a profane.</v>

553
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm lesbian of feminism.</v>

554
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right to be angry though.</v>

555
00:23:43.471 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean as the other</v>

556
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.440
<v Speaker 2>dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an oppressed class.</v>

557
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:49.043
<v Speaker 2>Well that women don't make equal money </v>
<v Speaker 2>as men or is that a myth about this all </v>

558
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:56.720
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course it's a myth.</v>

559
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those feminists missed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't die.</v>

560
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:59.463
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take all of the earnings of men </v>

561
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.390
<v Speaker 2>and all of the earnings of women and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a simple bit of maths,</v>

562
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:04.670
<v Speaker 2>then you'll get something like a 77.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

563
00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't take into account as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different choices that women make.</v>

564
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take into account a variety </v>
<v Speaker 2>of factors.</v>

565
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 2>No reputable economists takes the wage </v>
<v Speaker 2>gap seriously,</v>

566
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's repeated because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

567
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we still,</v>

568
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.930
<v Speaker 2>we saw where the stuff comes from just </v>
<v Speaker 2>this week for slut walk.</v>

569
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.773
<v Speaker 2>I was kicked out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a journalist for Time magazine </v>

570
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:24.344
<v Speaker 2>reported that 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that come out in support of the </v>

571
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 2>slut walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>

572
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.830
<v Speaker 2>It was like maybe 250.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She blathered she,</v>

573
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to sort of blame other people </v>

574
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 2>and eventually they changed it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>

575
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:36.374
<v Speaker 2>but it was still wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sort of like sloppy ideological </v>

576
00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:40.274
<v Speaker 2>reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sorry to say that the most </v>

577
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:44.000
<v Speaker 2>brazen untruths always come from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

578
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Just like most of the major plagiarism </v>
<v Speaker 2>scandals come from the left because they</v>

579
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:50.000
<v Speaker 2>believe in narrative over fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how rollingstone happened.</v>

580
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.751
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

581
00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:51.570
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

582
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 2>the fake rape in rolling stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our Duke Lacrosse happens.</v>

583
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:54.674
<v Speaker 2>It's how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

584
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.320
<v Speaker 2>all of these things happen because these</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal journalists believe that even if</v>

585
00:24:57.321 --> 00:24:58.154
<v Speaker 2>this one's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really important for us to talk </v>

586
00:24:58.881 --> 00:24:59.714
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm with you on that because even </v>

587
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:03.230
<v Speaker 2>with some of my prior guests like Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>and budget,</v>

588
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.370
<v Speaker 2>this is what they've done is what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

589
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're getting the receiving end of</v>

590
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:08.370
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

591
00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

593
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.920
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these memes of like,</v>

594
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's foot,</v>

595
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:14.720
<v Speaker 2>whether it's three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five women,</v>

596
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.270
<v Speaker 2>one in three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one in four,</v>

597
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:19.790
<v Speaker 2>one in five women are going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually assaulted on campus,</v>

598
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:21.940
<v Speaker 2>which is just nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's the wage gap,</v>

599
00:25:21.941 --> 00:25:23.990
<v Speaker 2>which is nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

600
00:25:23.991 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 2>these things become established as part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of almost almost.</v>

601
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:30.230
<v Speaker 2>They won't become almost folkloric and </v>
<v Speaker 2>look right up to the president.</v>

602
00:25:30.231 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean Obama repeat some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics,</v>

603
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:34.340
<v Speaker 2>but they're not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the work,</v>

604
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:35.174
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff summers I mentioned </v>

605
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.430
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American Enterprise Institute who to</v>

606
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.293
<v Speaker 2>very crisply and cleanly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainingly debunks this stuff I'm </v>

607
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.420
<v Speaker 2>working on getting well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's great and you should,</v>

608
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:45.254
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she takes a scalpel to these guys and </v>

609
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clinical and brilliant to watch it.</v>

610
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.653
<v Speaker 2>None of this stuff stacks up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're trying to make the case </v>

611
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:53.654
<v Speaker 2>that women have a right to be angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they should be angry because women </v>

612
00:25:56.331 --> 00:25:59.210
<v Speaker 2>have all of these injustices will ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>you what are these injustices?</v>

613
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 2>And every single one that's given by </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist,</v>

614
00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:03.200
<v Speaker 2>every example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's giving me a feminist does not stand</v>

615
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:04.034
<v Speaker 2>up to scrutiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are not an oppressed class in the </v>

616
00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:08.270
<v Speaker 2>west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no rape culture in the West.</v>

617
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.730
<v Speaker 2>We don't celebrate rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put them in prison.</v>

618
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Women don't earn less than men for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same work.</v>

619
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 2>That's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is true that you know,</v>

620
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>because women are mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are consequences when it,</v>

621
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.713
<v Speaker 2>when you get into the workplace on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a woman is paid the same work as a </v>

622
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:20.620
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>

623
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:21.463
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say there's a way this </v>

624
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:24.280
<v Speaker 2>confusion between wages and earnings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.420
<v Speaker 2>when you say seventy cents to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar,</v>

626
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:27.800
<v Speaker 2>what women here is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

627
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:29.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get page seventy seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>cents for a man's pound.</v>

628
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 2>No woman has that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen.</v>

629
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.863
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some women who work part time </v>

630
00:26:33.411 --> 00:26:34.100
<v Speaker 2>because they have children.</v>

631
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have children.</v>

632
00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:35.690
<v Speaker 2>What do you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

633
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.543
<v Speaker 2>the important thing is that we make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when women come back to work after </v>

634
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.300
<v Speaker 2>they have children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not disadvantaged for that.</v>

635
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Now where that's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>

636
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.033
<v Speaker 2>But it is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not a problem on the scale of </v>

637
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

638
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris and Majid we'll talk about,</v>

639
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening to women in the Middle East </v>

640
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.823
<v Speaker 2>and feminists will never talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this difficult stuff because they </v>

641
00:26:54.601 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to be put in a difficult</v>

642
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:59.340
<v Speaker 2>position of having to rank Islam versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

643
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.121
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

644
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:03.500
<v Speaker 1>that's where I'm western Western world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a western union,</v>

645
00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.383
<v Speaker 2>western world western feminism </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining about manspreading </v>

646
00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.920
<v Speaker 2>mansplaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this constant,</v>

647
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.440
<v Speaker 2>this constant message that men are evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>and broken and wrong,</v>

648
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.110
<v Speaker 2>toxic masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is offensive.</v>

649
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.600
<v Speaker 2>It's irritating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is wrong.</v>

650
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.583
<v Speaker 2>And it's district.</v>

651
00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.151
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

652
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:22.580
<v Speaker 1>let's go right to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

653
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 1>you wrote a piece this week about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the shooter in Oregon,</v>

654
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 1>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your piece basically was saying that men</v>

655
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:36.231
<v Speaker 1>are being abused in the media or so are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so easily dismissed in society,</v>

656
00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

657
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:39.913
<v Speaker 1>that they're acting out in crazy ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have to stop treating men like I </v>

658
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.873
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know a lot of people on the left </v>

659
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of the reasons you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing will read something like that</v>

660
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:49.250
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

661
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.780
<v Speaker 1>this is nonsense men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men have all the power.</v>

662
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I said was that it at least </v>

663
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:56.424
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>young men are acting out that we have </v>

664
00:27:58.711 --> 00:27:59.544
<v Speaker 2>these shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these shootings happening at least some </v>

665
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 2>of the reason for that is the horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>position we've put men in.</v>

666
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Now you can read everyday and major new </v>
<v Speaker 2>media publications,</v>

667
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

668
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:09.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

669
00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.813
<v Speaker 2>there is a problem intrinsically with </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a straight white male or just </v>

670
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:14.050
<v Speaker 2>being a white man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

671
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.133
<v Speaker 2>that somehow that gives you privileged </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to certain institutions that you </v>

672
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:18.594
<v Speaker 2>are somehow problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the experience of young men </v>

673
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.420
<v Speaker 2>today who go through university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our one in seven of them is,</v>

674
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.880
<v Speaker 2>it were put on Ritalin or adderall </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they are held up to a female.</v>

675
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:33.460
<v Speaker 2>But a female behavior standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the experience of boys.</v>

676
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a direct connection between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>medication and the and this.</v>

677
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there is,</v>

678
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.563
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there is a behavior not be </v>

679
00:28:41.251 --> 00:28:42.084
<v Speaker 2>upstanders babies standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there is because behavior has </v>

680
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.300
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

681
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meant behavior,</v>

682
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.400
<v Speaker 2>behavior standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

683
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:49.343
<v Speaker 2>and we're not just doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're also changing the way the </v>

684
00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:51.594
<v Speaker 2>exams are mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make them easier for women because </v>

685
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:55.200
<v Speaker 2>women don't test well and exams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So boys are struggling,</v>

686
00:28:55.201 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 2>boys are falling behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is not a controversial thing.</v>

687
00:28:57.391 --> 00:29:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows this boy's are falling </v>
<v Speaker 2>horribly behind girls in education.</v>

688
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.163
<v Speaker 2>Fewer men are going to the university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more women graduate when we get higher </v>

689
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 2>grades in the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

690
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:05.754
<v Speaker 2>Cornell study from 2015 showed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>women who have a two to one advantage </v>

691
00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>going for the same job just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's desperate to hire women.</v>

692
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.680
<v Speaker 2>The experiences of men growing up now do</v>
<v Speaker 2>not reflect these horrible headlines,</v>

693
00:29:15.681 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about straight white men.</v>

694
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think progressives have got themselves</v>

695
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:20.484
<v Speaker 2>into a really weird corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't seem to appreciate the irony </v>

696
00:29:22.381 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>of criticizing somebody for their skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>color and their orientation,</v>

697
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:25.760
<v Speaker 2>but they do it anyway,</v>

698
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would say,</v>

699
00:29:27.081 --> 00:29:28.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the group that's in power.</v>

700
00:29:28.971 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 1>So if they're being well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say yes,</v>

701
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.263
<v Speaker 2>the only claim that there is a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystical force in society known as the </v>

702
00:29:35.631 --> 00:29:36.464
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what these feminists will claim is </v>

703
00:29:38.181 --> 00:29:39.014
<v Speaker 2>that the patriarchy is responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping women down and all of these </v>

704
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 2>crazy expressions like toxic message in </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever flow from this,</v>

705
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.380
<v Speaker 2>this tired old ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

706
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.920
<v Speaker 2>about male power and an overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

707
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:56.380
<v Speaker 2>as Camille Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wonderful dissident feminist critic</v>

708
00:29:56.381 --> 00:29:56.801
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:29:56.801 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 2>if society but left in the left in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands of women,</v>

710
00:29:58.601 --> 00:29:59.434
<v Speaker 2>we'd still be living in mud huts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God for the Patriarchy Patriarchy </v>

711
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:02.554
<v Speaker 2>that got us to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the patriarchy to built the </v>

712
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy that built this floor and</v>

713
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:07.960
<v Speaker 2>the ceiling women didn't want to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the patriarchy that drives oil trucks</v>

714
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 2>in a steeple jacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

715
00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:10.210
<v Speaker 2>women don't want to do that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

716
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.343
<v Speaker 2>We're perfectly happy to complain about </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender representation when there aren't </v>

717
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:16.610
<v Speaker 2>enough women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

718
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.443
<v Speaker 2>when there aren't enough women in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a particular subject field for our </v>

719
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:20.644
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary quotas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't make it the same complaint </v>

720
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:22.890
<v Speaker 2>the other way around,</v>

721
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all of this stuff,</v>

722
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:24.983
<v Speaker 1>we're the ones that were going out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and women were taking care of </v>

723
00:30:27.661 --> 00:30:28.494
<v Speaker 1>the home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I find that argument is a little </v>

724
00:30:29.521 --> 00:30:30.354
<v Speaker 1>flimsy because</v>

725
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.230
<v Speaker 2>are there are people who say that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad way to structure society.</v>

726
00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean when we start to break down those</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender.</v>

727
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.313
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this all comes from this sort of </v>

728
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.113
<v Speaker 2>credited leftest idea that gender is </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially constructed and agenda is </v>

729
00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:42.140
<v Speaker 2>socially constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

730
00:30:42.141 --> 00:30:44.630
<v Speaker 2>If you're taught to be a boy or taught </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a girl,</v>

731
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.670
<v Speaker 2>rather than having a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

732
00:30:46.671 --> 00:30:49.640
<v Speaker 2>genetic behavior sort of encoded in you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

733
00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:51.980
<v Speaker 2>as a virtue by virtue of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>chromosomes,</v>

734
00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.641
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

735
00:30:53.641 --> 00:30:56.480
<v Speaker 2>if gender is a performance and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>social construct,</v>

736
00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.180
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why girls compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>boys and boys can't behave like girls.</v>

737
00:30:59.181 --> 00:31:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Now we're beginning to start to see that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall apart.</v>

738
00:31:01.101 --> 00:31:01.934
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways in which it falls apart </v>

739
00:31:02.571 --> 00:31:04.640
<v Speaker 2>as the transgender debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know now,</v>

740
00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.040
<v Speaker 2>now progressives are telling us the baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be born with the wrong brain.</v>

741
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:07.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could be born with a female </v>

742
00:31:08.541 --> 00:31:09.374
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there must be such a thing as a female </v>

743
00:31:10.011 --> 00:31:10.844
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So surely femininity can't be as a copy </v>

744
00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.570
<v Speaker 2>of social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make your bloody mine's up.</v>

745
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.420
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you see on this was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

746
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:19.283
<v Speaker 1>everybody was saying that Abi or most </v>
<v Speaker 1>sane people I think were saying that </v>

747
00:31:22.021 --> 00:31:25.290
<v Speaker 1>obviously Rachel Dolezal couldn't choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be black.</v>

748
00:31:25.291 --> 00:31:26.870
<v Speaker 1>She was white and she pretended</v>

749
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.013
<v Speaker 2>created by progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you said that blackness was a </v>

750
00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:31.504
<v Speaker 2>performance that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blackness was a social construct </v>

751
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 2>that race was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that rat race is a social construct.</v>

752
00:31:36.701 --> 00:31:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Of course it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

753
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 2>we know now because we have the computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>processing power to do it.</v>

754
00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:42.460
<v Speaker 2>We know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

755
00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:45.790
<v Speaker 2>when we look at the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are clusters of clusters of,</v>

756
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.653
<v Speaker 2>of information that map onto certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>geographies in that's in that </v>

757
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.520
<v Speaker 2>statistical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know now that race is real.</v>

758
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

759
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:57.070
<v Speaker 2>we know from ordinary people know from </v>
<v Speaker 2>common sense of our eyes and ears,</v>

760
00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that people look different and </v>

761
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 2>behave differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

762
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 2>we know that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but progressives for Mr,</v>

763
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.733
<v Speaker 2>variety of barmy reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best known to themselves have been </v>

764
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.120
<v Speaker 2>claiming that's gender and race are </v>
<v Speaker 2>social constructs.</v>

765
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff is starting to fall apart</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

766
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Is the gender one falling part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to Belabor this point,</v>

767
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:18.560
<v Speaker 1>but the gentleman's fully believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can be trans because I,</v>

768
00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some trans people.</v>

769
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:21.604
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt</v>

770
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say what I said.</v>

771
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.323
<v Speaker 2>What I said was I'm transgender debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>is very interesting and very dangerous </v>

772
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:29.770
<v Speaker 2>for progressives and they haven't yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with this.</v>

773
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can be born with the wrong brain,</v>

774
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.773
<v Speaker 2>if you can be born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can be born a man with a woman's </v>

775
00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:37.054
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means is such a thing as a woman's </v>

776
00:32:38.141 --> 00:32:38.974
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

777
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.973
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what transgender patients will do is </v>

778
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:43.690
<v Speaker 2>they start hacking away at themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them,</v>

779
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an anatomically more like </v>

780
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:46.634
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're somewhere between the two </v>

781
00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:50.390
<v Speaker 2>genders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the end of it,</v>

782
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're not functioning women,</v>

783
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 2>but they look a bit more like women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

784
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.093
<v Speaker 2>and some of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things work a bit more like women </v>

785
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.980
<v Speaker 2>and they have the appearance of women </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they say they have a woman's brain.</v>

786
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 2>If you're gonna have a woman's brain.</v>

787
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.193
<v Speaker 2>There is such a thing as a woman's brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's a biological basis for </v>

788
00:33:04.731 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 2>certain behavioral differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you were asking me about sort of men</v>

789
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:11.740
<v Speaker 2>going out to forage may not maybe no bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that we let men be career,</v>

790
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:12.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the hunter gatherers and women may </v>

791
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 2>indeed be happier focusing on bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

792
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.340
<v Speaker 2>bringing up children and building a </v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

793
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Certainly the women that I know that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their twenties that have been told,</v>

794
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 2>especially in their thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been told they can have it all.</v>

795
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 2>They can have a career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're living in a horrible apartment.</v>

796
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:28.274
<v Speaker 2>They don't live with a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're miserable or hay or their </v>

797
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:30.590
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not happy people.</v>

798
00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.693
<v Speaker 2>They've been encouraged to be single,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraged by feminism particularly to </v>

799
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:35.670
<v Speaker 2>look how they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

800
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.760
<v Speaker 2>this fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fat positivity.</v>

801
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:38.594
<v Speaker 2>That is another feminist trope is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look like what you want their </v>

802
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:43.190
<v Speaker 2>self esteem shouldn't depend on what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man thinks of you.</v>

803
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

804
00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:45.950
<v Speaker 2>it should because if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

805

<v Speaker 2>and have a nice happy life.</v>

807
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 2>There are certain things that men liking</v>
<v Speaker 2>women like stay thin.</v>

808
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:52.911
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

809
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:54.290
<v Speaker 2>and you may not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fact.</v>

810
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.513
<v Speaker 2>As gay men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that men are visual animals </v>

811
00:33:56.991 --> 00:33:57.950
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

812
00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.930
<v Speaker 2>some guys like fat girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not many.</v>

813
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>

814
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.493
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're listening to feminists who </v>

815
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:03.134
<v Speaker 2>were telling you can grow blue armpit </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair and you can burp and Fart and </v>

816
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 2>swear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be Lena Dunham,</v>

817
00:34:07.911 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 2>this disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quivering,</v>

818
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:10.540
<v Speaker 2>massive horror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

819
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and men will like you.</v>

820
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.793
<v Speaker 2>That's a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will not like you and you'll be alone </v>

821
00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:17.540
<v Speaker 2>and you'll be miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people here are going to</v>

822
00:34:17.541 --> 00:34:17.961
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

823
00:34:17.961 --> 00:34:18.794
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of somehow this is some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your gay rage or misogyny coming out in </v>

824
00:34:22.371 --> 00:34:23.160
<v Speaker 2>some of this stuff.</v>

825
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 2>So let's say I don't have a dog in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

826
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

827
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're thin or fat as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

828
00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:29.354
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to fuck you either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what I want is for people </v>

829
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:33.374
<v Speaker 2>to be happy and I see people not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy because I see that women are </v>

830
00:34:35.601 --> 00:34:38.000
<v Speaker 2>moving in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous direction.</v>

831
00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:43.001
<v Speaker 2>Told lies by Wacky fall f feminist </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazies who want to control other people</v>

832
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:44.054
<v Speaker 2>because they're hurting inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in many cases very often it's </v>

833
00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:47.654
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 year old bitter old woman trying to </v>

834
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 2>lecture 20 year old girls on how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave.</v>

835
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.970
<v Speaker 2>It's an ugly woman on woman form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence if you like a modern feminism.</v>

836
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:56.804
<v Speaker 2>It is a nasty thing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see women get drawn into this and </v>

837
00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:01.424
<v Speaker 2>I find it sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is of course one great hope </v>

838
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.190
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a silver lining to all this,</v>

839
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:08.400
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

840
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.210
<v Speaker 2>feminism is collapsing in popularity </v>
<v Speaker 2>among women.</v>

841
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in just a few years.</v>

842
00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:14.024
<v Speaker 2>The number of American women who </v>
<v Speaker 2>described themselves as feminist has </v>

843
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:16.124
<v Speaker 2>gone from 28 to 18 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can read in Vox is not somewhere </v>

844
00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:19.274
<v Speaker 2>that would advertise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This may just be because of the success </v>

845
00:35:21.921 --> 00:35:22.754
<v Speaker 2>of the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women who don't identify as feminists </v>

846
00:35:25.641 --> 00:35:29.270
<v Speaker 2>and they don't identify as feminists </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they see in feminism or IC,</v>

847
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 2>which is turned into a bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty,</v>

848
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.193
<v Speaker 2>ugly man hating empty horror show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly you read these blogs like </v>

849
00:35:38.131 --> 00:35:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Jenzabar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know which a rail against men.</v>

850
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.993
<v Speaker 2>Most women don't hate men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most women don't want to beat up on </v>

851
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:46.440
<v Speaker 2>people for being straight or being white</v>
<v Speaker 2>or being a male.</v>

852
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Most people quite like a boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.373
<v Speaker 2>so they see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have anything in common with </v>

854
00:35:50.641 --> 00:35:51.474
<v Speaker 2>these angry gender warriors who want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deny basic human nature and who make </v>

855
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.930
<v Speaker 2>claims and give instructions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost designed to make women miserable.</v>

856
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:58.943
<v Speaker 2>And I think most women recognize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why feminism is falling off a </v>

857
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 2>cliff with women.</v>

858
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I love how you wrap up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the things I disagree with in the,</v>

859
00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 1>in the social justice warrior prism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's my.</v>

860
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.483
<v Speaker 1>That's my weak spot because I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that that I have to sort of </v>

861
00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:12.480
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge some of what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

862
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.291
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

863
00:36:13.291 --> 00:36:14.640
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do one more thing and then I,</v>

864
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:16.670
<v Speaker 1>and then I want to spend the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>second half of this really on,</v>

865
00:36:16.671 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 1>on one topic specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to talk about atheism because</v>

866
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 1>it's been one of the so boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

867
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.030
<v Speaker 1>So just a couple of people wrong in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>room being very angry on the Internet.</v>

868
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.010
<v Speaker 1>So you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

869
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:29.844
<v Speaker 1>I sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost think that atheists don't </v>

870
00:36:31.051 --> 00:36:31.884
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

871
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.650
<v Speaker 2>that there's some lesbians don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're already.</v>

872
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to force you.</v>

873
00:36:36.301 --> 00:36:37.570
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are a,</v>

874
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.800
<v Speaker 2>you acknowledged that there are lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong people in the world,</v>

875
00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:41.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the wrong kinds of wrong </v>

876
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.530
<v Speaker 2>people are atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing I find fun about it,</v>

877
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really care if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes in God and I hope they do.</v>

878
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:49.164
<v Speaker 2>I wish they did because I know it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite nice if they join me up there in </v>

879
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 2>40 slash 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something up there.</v>

880
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I've got a first class ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loves me.</v>

881
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm very confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing up there.</v>

882
00:37:00.841 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 2>There's a lighting grid have been built </v>
<v Speaker 2>by men.</v>

883
00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

884
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I.</v>

885
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.310
<v Speaker 2>The reason I haven't go atheists because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun because they're so thin skin.</v>

886
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:12.144
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>

887
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.163
<v Speaker 2>They're like libertarians or they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cyclists or Liberal Democrats in </v>

888
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:19.210
<v Speaker 2>the UK or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other sort of feminists.</v>

889
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.780
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so easy to wind up.</v>

890
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:22.614
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how many atheists it takes to </v>

891
00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:26.220
<v Speaker 2>change a light bulb and before you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>even given the punchline,</v>

892
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.640
<v Speaker 2>people are furious and there's a reddit </v>
<v Speaker 2>thread about it and they're just so much</v>

893
00:37:29.641 --> 00:37:29.810
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

894
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:30.643
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why will you be going after the </v>

895
00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:32.900
<v Speaker 1>people that it's easy to go after?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

896
00:37:32.901 --> 00:37:35.020
<v Speaker 1>every poll shows that the most hated</v>

897
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.290
<v Speaker 2>my in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would know these victims.</v>

898
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.343
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people have some of the most </v>

899
00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:42.750
<v Speaker 2>celebrated public intellectuals on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

900
00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:43.584
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the late Christopher Christopher </v>

901
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.413
<v Speaker 2>hitchens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people have huge public </v>

902
00:37:46.741 --> 00:37:47.970
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millet,</v>

903
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.170
<v Speaker 2>militant atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'd like.</v>

904
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 2>If he is Mr trendiest thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

905
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Every journalist is an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in the media,</v>

906
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:53.921
<v Speaker 2>as an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

907
00:37:53.921 --> 00:37:54.754
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to get somebody laugh</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you or look at you weirdly for </v>

908
00:37:57.151 --> 00:37:57.984
<v Speaker 2>announcing you're an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you announced you're a Christian or a </v>

909
00:37:59.311 --> 00:38:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Muslim or if or maybe especially a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

910
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of bad things happen to you,</v>

911
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:05.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>

912
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.880
<v Speaker 2>nobody looks at you funny except me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably one person.</v>

913
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.440
<v Speaker 2>If you announced that you were an </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist,</v>

914
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:13.950
<v Speaker 2>so don't be that victim because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know this is,</v>

915
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.873
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a privileged group in society </v>

916
00:38:16.231 --> 00:38:20.520
<v Speaker 2>that I find it funny to take the Mickey </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of because they are so touchy.</v>

917
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:21.523
<v Speaker 1>This is interesting because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you were talking about </v>

918
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Gamergate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what you liked is that there was</v>

919
00:38:24.981 --> 00:38:26.840
<v Speaker 1>this groundswell coming up from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>

920
00:38:26.841 --> 00:38:27.674
<v Speaker 1>fighting this authoritarian sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think religion people have that again </v>

921
00:38:29.991 --> 00:38:32.420
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we're there yet.</v>

922
00:38:32.421 --> 00:38:34.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that angle and this is what all my</v>

923
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>friends on the say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

924
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.980
<v Speaker 2>the bridge is now are the ones being </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed and Christians are being.</v>

925
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go so far as to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed,</v>

926
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 2>but saying it's basically crazy as is </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

927
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.713
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go as far as to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians are an oppressed class in </v>

928
00:38:48.131 --> 00:38:48.964
<v Speaker 2>this country because I don't think there</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't many press clusters in this </v>

929
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:52.100
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do anything.</v>

930
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe black people still.</v>

931
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the only one in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

932
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:56.763
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're an oppressed </v>

933
00:38:57.791 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think,</v>

934
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been very ashamed of my fellow,</v>

935
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.573
<v Speaker 2>my fellow homosexuals in the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have behaved toward Christians in some </v>

936
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 2>of the media circus that happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

937
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I have so I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go with you on that.</v>

938
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Plead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plead deeply,</v>

939
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:11.494
<v Speaker 2>horrifying to watch gay people treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians as gays were treated for </v>

940
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.310
<v Speaker 2>barely two decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

941
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think there's some value there,</v>

942
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.210
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>

943
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:20.043
<v Speaker 2>I have noticed I did a David Webb who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a guest on our show in a </v>

944
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.460
<v Speaker 2>couple weeks from Fox News and on Sirius</v>
<v Speaker 2>Xm.</v>

945
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.413
<v Speaker 2>I was on his show when gay marriage was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was being passed by the Supreme Court </v>

946
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 2>and the law was being struck down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shame is shame and we'll get to that too</v>

947
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 2>in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he said to me,</v>

948
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 2>it just literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the first day was the day</v>

949
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:41.440
<v Speaker 2>that had happened was that we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>really already start being a.</v>

950
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.393
<v Speaker 2>We should start policing the gaze to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure we don't start pressing </v>

951
00:39:45.191 --> 00:39:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't that.</v>

952
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.613
<v Speaker 2>Don't we have to give it a little time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't we have to let gays have a little </v>

953
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:54.340
<v Speaker 2>time to work with to be bullied someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>before suddenly accusing them?</v>

954
00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:54.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

955
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.010
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to give gay people anytime</v>

956
00:39:57.011 --> 00:39:58.680
<v Speaker 2>to be bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have shown and this is a,</v>

957
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:59.650
<v Speaker 2>this is what you are.</v>

958
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.510
<v Speaker 2>This is something that I always find </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about people,</v>

959
00:40:01.511 --> 00:40:03.910
<v Speaker 2>how they behave when they enter the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corridors of power,</v>

960
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.983
<v Speaker 2>how people behave when they are granted </v>
<v Speaker 2>the status that they have asked for for </v>

961
00:40:07.721 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 2>so long when gays are finally not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>equal in society,</v>

962
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 2>but held up as models of paragons of </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue.</v>

963
00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read it,</v>

964
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 2>you read Gawker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buzzfeed,</v>

965
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you would think they'd be engaged with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of moral objective,</v>

966
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.423
<v Speaker 2>but being gay with someone so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was better than being straight in </v>

967
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:21.334
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

968
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna say,</v>

969
00:40:22.391 --> 00:40:23.051
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

970
00:40:23.051 --> 00:40:23.884
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll perhaps discuss it in the second </v>

971
00:40:24.311 --> 00:40:25.390
<v Speaker 2>half of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think on that,</v>

972
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:26.740
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

973
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.020
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like a weird proposition </v>
<v Speaker 2>and therefore on the face of it.</v>

974
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 2>But if you read buzzfeed or vox or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Corker,</v>

975
00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.350
<v Speaker 2>you'll get that impression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

976
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think gay people deserve anytime</v>

977
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.660
<v Speaker 2>to be bullies to settle into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

978
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.260
<v Speaker 2>their position or authority.</v>

979
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And I think it does gay people a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage to see these bitter,</v>

980
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:42.904
<v Speaker 2>hysterical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nasty Queens bullying and lecturing and </v>

981
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:46.924
<v Speaker 2>hectoring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary decent law abiding people of </v>

982
00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:49.954
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was utterly deplorable </v>

983
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.570
<v Speaker 2>when that couple who staged a renew of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the vowels,</v>

984
00:40:55.571 --> 00:40:56.404
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even have a wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they staged a renewal of the vows </v>

985
00:40:58.061 --> 00:40:58.894
<v Speaker 2>because already had the wedding solely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed to get a photo opportunity </v>

986
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:03.190
<v Speaker 2>with pizzas from memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pizza,</v>

987
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.053
<v Speaker 2>which they they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tricked this Christian Christian </v>

988
00:41:05.951 --> 00:41:09.920
<v Speaker 2>pizzeria into catering their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now set aside the horror,</v>

989
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I think most gay people will feel about </v>
<v Speaker 2>pizza and whether the carb would.</v>

990
00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:16.534
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm Greek and 13 showing I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>told you a cameraman to shoot me from </v>

991
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.610
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Set that aside,</v>

992
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 2>or how hollow and bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a terror,</v>

993
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.423
<v Speaker 2>what an awful kind of human being you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to be to turn your special </v>

994
00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:27.694
<v Speaker 2>day of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Send a day of appreciation and </v>

995
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:32.710
<v Speaker 2>celebration between you and your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that you love into an a cheap</v>

996
00:41:32.711 --> 00:41:37.650
<v Speaker 2>political stump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that you think that gay people in</v>

997
00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:40.790
<v Speaker 2>many cases turn themselves into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst kind of grandstanding bigots.</v>

998
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:41.624
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not need time to settle in </v>

999
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:43.430
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very much settled.</v>

1000
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.311
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1001
00:41:44.311 --> 00:41:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of with you on that because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do understand that.</v>

1002
00:41:46.931 --> 00:41:47.764
<v Speaker 3>Look this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they purposely did this for a Christian </v>

1003
00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Baker had they went to have they go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>an orthodox Jewish Baker or,</v>

1004
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.170
<v Speaker 3>or a Muslim baker and forced them to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1005
00:41:56.171 --> 00:41:58.060
<v Speaker 3>The media wouldn't have nearly the fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they had,</v>

1006
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.073
<v Speaker 3>but so just wrapping this around atheism</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we're going to do everything </v>

1007
00:42:01.721 --> 00:42:03.820
<v Speaker 3>else we're going to do is gay for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of this after,</v>

1008
00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:04.654
<v Speaker 3>after this final question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's exhausting learning about </v>

1009
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.730
<v Speaker 3>what position of power do you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1010
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.770
<v Speaker 3>that I don't see atheists in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

1011
00:42:11.771 --> 00:42:12.604
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a couple cool thought of </v>

1012
00:42:13.841 --> 00:42:15.340
<v Speaker 3>atheists out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1013
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.130
<v Speaker 3>So not about Neil degrasse Tyson or </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to someone about it because it's</v>

1014
00:42:18.131 --> 00:42:20.640
<v Speaker 3>not about positions of power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about,</v>

1015
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:21.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>

1016
00:42:21.431 --> 00:42:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Social cache,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1017
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.810
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main,</v>

1018
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.753
<v Speaker 3>the average atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which an atheist is only brought </v>

1019
00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:28.390
<v Speaker 3>together by the lack of belief in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>deity.</v>

1020
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.480
<v Speaker 3>A what</v>

1021
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.430
<v Speaker 2>brought together by um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1022
00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:36.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of whispery facial hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible spectacle,</v>

1023
00:42:36.301 --> 00:42:39.960
<v Speaker 2>sort of long ginger ponytails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

1024
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.030
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thin skinned,</v>

1025
00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.360
<v Speaker 2>natural sort of demeanor to hair trigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>temper.</v>

1026
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:49.830
<v Speaker 2>These are the primary characteristics of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an atheist looking at socks and sandals.</v>

1027
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Terrible cheap Chinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1028
00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.290
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want to consider.</v>

1029
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.380
<v Speaker 2>If that's what you want to respond to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then go right ahead.</v>

1030
00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.333
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic Catholics have all the best </v>

1031
00:43:02.821 --> 00:43:03.770
<v Speaker 2>outfits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.740
<v Speaker 2>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>older men in dresses.</v>

1033
00:43:04.741 --> 00:43:05.574
<v Speaker 2>What's not to love whenever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want everyone to have a sense of </v>

1034
00:43:07.231 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 2>style and you become a Muslim or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic.</v>

1035
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1036
00:43:10.861 --> 00:43:11.694
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1037
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.780
<v Speaker 2>atheists are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not just acceptable,</v>

1038
00:43:15.781 --> 00:43:16.614
<v Speaker 2>but it is the norm in any metropolitan </v>
<v Speaker 2>city in Europe or in America to be an </v>

1039
00:43:20.071 --> 00:43:21.510
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is normal to be an atheist.</v>

1040
00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:22.860
<v Speaker 2>People look at you weird if you're not</v>

1041
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:23.803
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>

1042
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:25.510
<v Speaker 3>So what's the problem with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1043
00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.760
<v Speaker 3>that's the part I think it's funny to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take the piss out of them.</v>

1044
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 3>You just want to make fun of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though I enjoy making fun.</v>

1045
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:31.323
<v Speaker 2>The Mondrian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making fun out of everybody and you're </v>

1046
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.000
<v Speaker 2>making fun of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed making fun of myself.</v>

1047
00:43:34.001 --> 00:43:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I make fun out of myself all day on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter feed.</v>

1048
00:43:35.801 --> 00:43:36.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what</v>

1049
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.070
<v Speaker 3>provocateurs do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1050
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.010
<v Speaker 3>well I can accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will grant you that,</v>

1051
00:43:41.011 --> 00:43:42.780
<v Speaker 3>but I won Niger one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that little section,</v>

1052
00:43:42.781 --> 00:43:43.500
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1053
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.080
<v Speaker 3>you can have one hour if you can have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1054
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.900
<v Speaker 3>I want to spend the rest of the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about a whole bunch of gay stuff</v>

1055
00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:53.250
<v Speaker 3>because I mentioned on the show a week </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've done five of these here.</v>

1056
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.860
<v Speaker 3>I think this is our fifth episode since </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been with aura.</v>

1057
00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I've only watched once mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about being gay.</v>

1058
00:43:58.651 --> 00:43:59.484
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't make it an issue unless it's </v>

1059
00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:04.050
<v Speaker 3>relevant and it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1060
00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:05.670
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gay.</v>

1061
00:44:05.671 --> 00:44:06.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1062
00:44:06.781 --> 00:44:08.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm married to do pretty gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1063
00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:09.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1064
00:44:09.961 --> 00:44:12.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1065
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you will selling,</v>

1066
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.163
<v Speaker 3>selling out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling out to the Hetero picture </v>

1067
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:18.030
<v Speaker 3>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1068
00:44:18.031 --> 00:44:18.960
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll get to those.</v>

1069
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.540
<v Speaker 3>I know you have a better game.</v>

1071
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 2>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1072
00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Anything more awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before</v>

1073
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:28.320
<v Speaker 3>we do that portion of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hilarious.</v>

1074
00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:30.990
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the liberal here married one.</v>

1075
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.030
<v Speaker 3>The conservative one is the one railing </v>
<v Speaker 3>against marriage.</v>

1076
00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:33.890
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating.</v>

1077
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's sad that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1078
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 3>I want heterosexual to come back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>institution of marriage.</v>

1079
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 3>I want them to realize that it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1080
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 3>I want them to become more socially </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative in that regard.</v>

1081
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't want gay people being growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1082
00:44:44.961 --> 00:44:45.794
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're just going to go all in on </v>

1083
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:47.310
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll reverse my question.</v>

1084
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 3>So go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

1085
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.640
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think being gay</v>

1086
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.170
<v Speaker 2>particularly fun and I wouldn't choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>it for my children.</v>

1087
00:44:53.171 --> 00:44:55.150
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Sally Cohen who said that they'd</v>

1088
00:44:55.151 --> 00:44:57.250
<v Speaker 2>like so that she'd like to have a gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>

1089
00:44:57.251 --> 00:44:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was deplorable and sadistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and incredibly selfish.</v>

1090
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.713
<v Speaker 3>So meaning what if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if salsify has come to a place of </v>

1091
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:05.400
<v Speaker 3>realization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what she said was if she could,</v>

1092
00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 3>if she said what she said was if she </v>
<v Speaker 3>could pick,</v>

1093
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:07.674
<v Speaker 3>she'd rather have a gay kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that was a horrible thing </v>

1094
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:11.940
<v Speaker 3>to say because what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your last child?</v>

1095
00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.950
<v Speaker 3>My Trans Life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much more miserable.</v>

1096
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's getting easier every day.</v>

1097
00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:17.220
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that when,</v>

1098
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how old are you?</v>

1099
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh Gee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't ask again.</v>

1100
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:23.960
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you really aren't a proper gay.</v>

1101
00:45:23.961 --> 00:45:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible failure as a gay man lady.</v>

1102
00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.540
<v Speaker 3>What point b?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot,</v>

1103
00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:30.403
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot easier for you than it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a 30 year old gay man 10 years ago </v>

1104
00:45:34.341 --> 00:45:38.600
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to be way shobin the </v>
<v Speaker 3>normalcy that will,</v>

1105
00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:44.310
<v Speaker 2>you're confusing two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a sort of practical,</v>

1106
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.673
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ease with which a gay person can go </v>

1107
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 2>through life because there is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entrenched homophobia if you like it</v>

1108
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.290
<v Speaker 2>in wider society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The um,</v>

1109
00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.120
<v Speaker 2>the fact that gay people can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can show,</v>

1110
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 2>can have a relationship and live </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and nobody really cares.</v>

1111
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:01.350
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think anybody cares anymore.</v>

1112
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I've said that for a long time.</v>

1113
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sick of talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I don't.</v>

1114
00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.253
<v Speaker 3>All I wanted was equal rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to be treated better than </v>

1115
00:46:09.231 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think gay people</v>

1116
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.143
<v Speaker 2>for getting married and in relationships</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a shame because I quite like the </v>

1117
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:15.104
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a naughty sort of aspects of gay </v>

1118
00:46:17.511 --> 00:46:18.344
<v Speaker 2>life and I think that it's part of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay privileged to be able to tumble out </v>

1119
00:46:20.601 --> 00:46:22.250
<v Speaker 2>of a nightclub at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM with,</v>

1120
00:46:22.251 --> 00:46:23.084
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of dormant on my arm and he hops </v>

1121
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.910
<v Speaker 2>off off my face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1122
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.043
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do that while still having other </v>

1123
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.560
<v Speaker 3>people like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like you getting married,</v>

1124
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 3>getting a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in a little house in a horrible,</v>

1125
00:46:38.021 --> 00:46:40.150
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no self respecting gay home,</v>

1126
00:46:40.151 --> 00:46:40.984
<v Speaker 3>enough to feed something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I doesn't know what you're doing with </v>

1127
00:46:43.491 --> 00:46:44.750
<v Speaker 3>your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

1128
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.930
<v Speaker 3>He'll come home and come and sit down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I tell him who's cooking tonight.</v>

1129
00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I do?</v>

1130
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right then.</v>

1131
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's awful,</v>

1132
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.310
<v Speaker 3>awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful.</v>

1133
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.680
<v Speaker 3>But you shouldn't be in house long </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

1134
00:46:53.681 --> 00:46:56.530
<v Speaker 3>You've got to keep that alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really do you really believe that?</v>

1135
00:46:56.531 --> 00:46:57.364
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get what you're doing here on the </v>

1136
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:00.250
<v Speaker 3>snark level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1137
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:01.323
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think there's some value in this </v>

1138
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:03.350
<v Speaker 3>cause</v>

1139
00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's because gape.</v>

1140
00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:09.483
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality is a dissident apple </v>

1141
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.430
<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that in a,</v>

1142
00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:16.550
<v Speaker 2>in a morally neutral sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just mean it's the other.</v>

1143
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.443
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that in using the term </v>

1144
00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.100
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you mean?</v>

1145
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.963
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say apartment.</v>

1146
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1147
00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1148
00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.350
<v Speaker 2>let's set the religion stuff aside </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was going to get into a rabbit</v>

1149
00:47:27.351 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 2>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say you know,</v>

1150
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.950
<v Speaker 2>what is not the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is an abhorrent sexuality that Mother</v>

1151
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Nature May do for a variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1152
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:35.403
<v Speaker 2>There's some evidence that people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher iqs are more likely to engage in </v>

1153
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.733
<v Speaker 2>different sexual appetites is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons why gay people have </v>

1154
00:47:41.381 --> 00:47:43.990
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately higher iqs and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons I think,</v>

1155
00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:45.490
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guests would get back in the closet</v>

1156
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:46.324
<v Speaker 2>because we're making society stupider </v>
<v Speaker 2>because gay people aren't reading </v>

1157
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1158
00:47:48.701 --> 00:47:49.534
<v Speaker 2>it was previously you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have a marriage with a woman </v>

1159
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:51.933
<v Speaker 2>and you would have a couple of kids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay men were still in the gene pool </v>

1160
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:54.574
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've taken themselves out and they </v>

1161
00:47:55.391 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 2>don't have their own biological children</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1162
00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:57.664
<v Speaker 2>Like you've got your sort of two to five</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the smartest men in </v>

1163
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 2>population not breeding in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:01.970
<v Speaker 3>What people keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we going to have kids?</v>

1165
00:48:01.971 --> 00:48:02.541
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1166
00:48:02.541 --> 00:48:03.590
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do,</v>

1167
00:48:03.591 --> 00:48:04.424
<v Speaker 3>you should have your own biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>children because you're smarter than </v>

1168
00:48:05.781 --> 00:48:08.660
<v Speaker 3>most people in your lab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you catch that?</v>

1169
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:11.280
<v Speaker 3>What we're going to keep trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1170
00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.640
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so into your thing.</v>

1171
00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 3>They're being serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1172
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.290
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1173
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1174
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:16.881
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1175
00:48:16.881 --> 00:48:17.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1176
00:48:17.271 --> 00:48:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

1177
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:22.240
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:24.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a silly thing,</v>

1179
00:48:24.081 --> 00:48:24.914
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly true that the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>average intelligence society sort of </v>

1180
00:48:28.011 --> 00:48:30.380
<v Speaker 2>chugging up with slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is definitely being retarded.</v>

1181
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.243
<v Speaker 2>If a five to 10 percent of two to five </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent rather have the smartest people </v>

1182
00:48:34.821 --> 00:48:36.260
<v Speaker 2>in society aren't breathing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1183
00:48:36.261 --> 00:48:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a silly argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1184
00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:38.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1185
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I do think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a shame when,</v>

1186
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.113
<v Speaker 2>as a gay is just one of those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Mother Nature has selected to be </v>

1187
00:48:46.911 --> 00:48:49.400
<v Speaker 2>different and to test stuff out and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>push the boundaries,</v>

1188
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:51.170
<v Speaker 2>which we'll come onto in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In respect to free speech,</v>

1189
00:48:51.171 --> 00:48:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1190
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.520
<v Speaker 2>that you sort of buy into precisely the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1191
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.473
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of socially conservative </v>

1192
00:48:57.021 --> 00:48:57.854
<v Speaker 2>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I love and I recognize the </v>

1193
00:48:58.791 --> 00:49:01.150
<v Speaker 2>building blocks of society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recognize at the basis of elephants,</v>

1194
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.433
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated</v>

1195
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.113
<v Speaker 2>as a homosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not escapes that shouldn't have them as </v>

1196
00:49:07.641 --> 00:49:09.470
<v Speaker 2>a homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should recognize that your,</v>

1197
00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.693
<v Speaker 2>your evolutionary function is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment with different models of </v>

1198
00:49:14.421 --> 00:49:15.254
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1199
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:16.123
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways in which gay culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>and society has done is the sort of sex </v>

1200
00:49:19.161 --> 00:49:21.900
<v Speaker 2>matt hedonism that I enjoy that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1201
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry that you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any more because you have</v>

1202
00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:25.244
<v Speaker 2>this horrible.</v>

1203
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Well I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1204
00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:28.903
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're combining different things </v>

1205
00:49:30.111 --> 00:49:31.550
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first off,</v>

1206
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.010
<v Speaker 3>the sense that a lot of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying is you just,</v>

1207
00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.810
<v Speaker 3>you long for the day probably when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were 22 and you were out every night and</v>

1208
00:49:38.811 --> 00:49:40.630
<v Speaker 3>doing all kinds of drugs and having all </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of.</v>

1209
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:42.980
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'd last week,</v>

1210
00:49:42.981 --> 00:49:45.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you on for that day and a lot of,</v>

1211
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:48.620
<v Speaker 3>a lot of mainstream gay look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in West Hollywood.</v>

1212
00:49:48.621 --> 00:49:52.940
<v Speaker 3>I see what the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think gay people have become very,</v>

1213
00:49:52.941 --> 00:49:55.700
<v Speaker 3>very dull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a shame isn't that?</v>

1214
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:57.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good because we assess,</v>

1215
00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.360
<v Speaker 3>we have equality.</v>

1216
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.590
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would we want to be equal?</v>

1217
00:50:01.591 --> 00:50:02.424
<v Speaker 2>We were already superior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would we want to go down to a </v>

1218
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:06.390
<v Speaker 2>quality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absurd to me.</v>

1219
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.151
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
00:50:07.151 --> 00:50:10.290
<v Speaker 2>we have gay people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mother Nature makes mistakes and make so</v>

1221
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:11.430
<v Speaker 2>great discoveries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will be great.</v>

1222
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.140
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] called the gate geniuses in </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

1223
00:50:13.141 --> 00:50:14.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's cheering or you know,</v>

1224
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Abe Lincoln reportedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1225
00:50:16.801 --> 00:50:17.960
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Roman emperors,</v>

1226
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:18.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what Mother Nature does with </v>

1227
00:50:20.131 --> 00:50:25.050
<v Speaker 2>these special people at the top end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the intelligence and sort of decisions a</v>

1228
00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.213
<v Speaker 2>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

1229
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.590
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1230
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 2>what steve jobs will called the crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>

1231
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:30.044
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why the tech and gaming </v>

1232
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:31.964
<v Speaker 2>industry so disproportionately I'm gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Trans because it's those special </v>

1233
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:36.074
<v Speaker 2>people that have brains wired slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently from others who could make </v>

1234
00:50:38.061 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 2>those great leaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can consider problems differently,</v>

1235
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.430
<v Speaker 2>who could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are generally more creative and more</v>

1236
00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:45.220
<v Speaker 3>what I'm with you on the music</v>

1237
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:49.120
<v Speaker 2>as a why as a member of the game master </v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

1238
00:50:49.121 --> 00:50:51.850
<v Speaker 2>would you want to slump down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of heterosexuality</v>

1239
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:53.993
<v Speaker 3>because you should have the option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling you what to do if you </v>

1240
00:50:57.601 --> 00:50:58.434
<v Speaker 3>want the option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm telling you as you made the </v>

1241
00:50:58.921 --> 00:51:01.910
<v Speaker 3>wrong choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1242
00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.753
<v Speaker 3>So you don't think that a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are doing all the things </v>

1243
00:51:06.541 --> 00:51:09.120
<v Speaker 3>that I did them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of those things,</v>

1244
00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.171
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>

1245
00:51:10.171 --> 00:51:11.520
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did all that.</v>

1246
00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.990
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1247
00:51:12.991 --> 00:51:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I look back on much of it very fondly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

1248
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.553
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people call me a traitor to my </v>

1249
00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.380
<v Speaker 3>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tracy Tracy,</v>

1250
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.493
<v Speaker 2>at least that moment to fill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my agent would allow me to tell </v>

1251
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.270
<v Speaker 2>you why come to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1252
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1253
00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:28.180
<v Speaker 3>but wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the things that you,</v>

1254
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I think you're looking at this in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>nostalgic way of fun,</v>

1255
00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:34.470
<v Speaker 3>but there was the sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wouldn't you trade some of that?</v>

1256
00:51:34.471 --> 00:51:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about all the people that</v>

1257
00:51:35.731 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 3>are having promiscuous sex and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>

1258
00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:42.690
<v Speaker 3>are those numbers going to directly go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down because</v>

1259
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.250
<v Speaker 2>care about sexually transmitted </v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>

1260
00:51:45.251 --> 00:51:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about that.</v>

1261
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:52.090
<v Speaker 2>What I care about is the fact that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a serious point here.</v>

1262
00:51:52.091 --> 00:51:54.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the foreigner living those</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun lifestyles,</v>

1263
00:51:54.101 --> 00:51:55.580
<v Speaker 2>and I mentioned Steve Jobs earlier and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1264
00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:56.414
<v Speaker 2>but much moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of his innovations come from the </v>

1265
00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.700
<v Speaker 2>faculty took Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1266
00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Gay people have a license to experiment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and license to explore.</v>

1267
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.633
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's one of the reasons why I'm gay </v>

1268
00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.370
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so,</v>

1269
00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:08.020
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1270
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:09.453
<v Speaker 2>to do with exploring boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing the limits of acceptable </v>

1271
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:13.840
<v Speaker 2>discourse and speech and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1272
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:17.880
<v Speaker 3>Those are all the things that I love </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I know you don't because you slid,</v>

1273
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 3>slid into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm honoring all the slit,</v>

1274
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.820
<v Speaker 2>boring domesticity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is precisely with those,</v>

1275
00:52:24.821 --> 00:52:28.090
<v Speaker 2>put those horizon broadening experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have given up as a,</v>

1276
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.193
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a housewife or house husband or </v>

1277
00:52:30.191 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1278
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I think two weeks of having home cooked </v>
<v Speaker 3>meals and watching that for two weeks,</v>

1279
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.570
<v Speaker 3>if I wanted to enjoy myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to kill myself and people call me</v>

1280
00:52:39.571 --> 00:52:40.020
<v Speaker 3>a traitor,</v>

1281
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.530
<v Speaker 2>my sexuality please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1282
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:42.670
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1283
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:43.503
<v Speaker 2>I think that gay people are one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups in which mother nature sort of </v>

1284
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.823
<v Speaker 2>one of the groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mother Nature's given license to go go </v>

1285
00:52:49.361 --> 00:52:52.510
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why so many great artists and</v>

1286
00:52:52.511 --> 00:52:55.480
<v Speaker 2>inventors and authors and all ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay,</v>

1287
00:52:55.481 --> 00:52:55.971
<v Speaker 2>lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1288
00:52:55.971 --> 00:52:56.804
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we have a unique license and </v>

1289
00:52:58.901 --> 00:53:01.300
<v Speaker 2>unique opportunity in insight into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fringes,</v>

1290
00:53:01.301 --> 00:53:04.900
<v Speaker 2>into the that the edge of culture that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes stuff interesting.</v>

1291
00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:08.380
<v Speaker 2>We have an ability to push further than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than ordinary people can.</v>

1292
00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.900
<v Speaker 2>We can say things they can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1293
00:53:10.901 --> 00:53:11.734
<v Speaker 2>I can go on TV and say all manner of </v>
<v Speaker 2>outrageous things about feminism only </v>

1294
00:53:14.771 --> 00:53:15.940
<v Speaker 2>because I'm homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1295
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think I could get away with those</v>

1296
00:53:18.191 --> 00:53:19.024
<v Speaker 3>same things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously we have a little </v>

1297
00:53:19.781 --> 00:53:21.010
<v Speaker 3>different effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People always say to me,</v>

1298
00:53:21.011 --> 00:53:21.844
<v Speaker 3>you don't see gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I know you wouldn't able to you </v>

1299
00:53:23.151 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 3>would you say it as compliment kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my thing,</v>

1300
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.173
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People know that I'm going to do this </v>

1301
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:29.063
<v Speaker 2>sort of social justice proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to argue that a </v>

1302
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:32.970
<v Speaker 2>flamboyant homosexual who never shuts up</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1303
00:53:32.971 --> 00:53:34.110
<v Speaker 2>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:36.690
<v Speaker 2>black boyfriends is in any way bigoted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1305
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:37.703
<v Speaker 2>So it gives me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have established myself in the public </v>

1306
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public imagination in a way that you</v>

1307
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:42.180
<v Speaker 2>haven't.</v>

1308
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.440
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically,</v>

1309
00:53:43.441 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what this is about you like while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in some ways rail against these</v>

1310
00:53:47.581 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 1>people that want to be protected like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the feminists or whatever you do.</v>

1311
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:51.714
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

1312
00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:52.893
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy using their weapons against them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm perfectly open to use a weapon </v>

1313
00:53:54.661 --> 00:53:57.400
<v Speaker 2>against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I didn't have too much.</v>

1314
00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.073
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be trolling people for </v>

1315
00:53:59.561 --> 00:54:00.600
<v Speaker 2>my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I don't,</v>

1316
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would much rather it were the case</v>

1317
00:54:03.301 --> 00:54:05.670
<v Speaker 2>that everybody had free open frank </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

1318
00:54:05.671 --> 00:54:07.290
<v Speaker 2>But as the media as currently </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituted,</v>

1319
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:08.124
<v Speaker 2>if you want to push forward to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion outside the realms of </v>

1320
00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:13.260
<v Speaker 2>academia in the public square talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary people.</v>

1321
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:14.423
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write for a publication that sort of </v>

1322
00:54:15.121 --> 00:54:17.580
<v Speaker 2>mid Brown midmarket publication for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

1323
00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.553
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of Digital Media Company of a </v>

1324
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:20.740
<v Speaker 2>tabloid newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1325
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I wanna talk to everybody and to push </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate forward in those environments.</v>

1326
00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:24.654
<v Speaker 2>You do have to play by the rules and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those rules are based on </v>

1327
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:28.700
<v Speaker 2>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think are absurd and obscene.</v>

1328
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:29.543
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I will certainly play along with </v>

1329
00:54:30.751 --> 00:54:35.751
<v Speaker 2>them if it helps because it's so long as</v>
<v Speaker 2>as progressives and feminists refused to</v>

1330
00:54:36.061 --> 00:54:38.790
<v Speaker 2>have a debate on the base of the facts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and insist on having a debate,</v>

1331
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basis of identity and skin color </v>

1332
00:54:41.731 --> 00:54:42.570
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

1333
00:54:42.571 --> 00:54:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I can beat them in that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1334
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to beat you on any playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>field on any battlefield you choose.</v>

1335
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:49.014
<v Speaker 2>They've chosen identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can beat them there if they ever want </v>

1336
00:54:50.761 --> 00:54:51.920
<v Speaker 2>to come to the table and debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

1337
00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:53.683
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto something </v>

1338
00:54:54.471 --> 00:54:56.300
<v Speaker 1>interesting there that you'll use their </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

1339
00:54:56.301 --> 00:54:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't like their weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>

1340
00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.110
<v Speaker 1>that you're using their weapons against </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1341
00:55:00.111 --> 00:55:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I think in a cheeky sense were you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1342
00:55:02.541 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 1>that you're a wink to what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1343
00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:07.620
<v Speaker 2>anybody who reads my twitter feed knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1344
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:08.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what's up.</v>

1345
00:55:08.861 --> 00:55:10.540
<v Speaker 2>I know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they still lose.</v>

1346
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.393
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1347
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:12.370
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1348
00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:16.030
<v Speaker 1>so part of the reason why I wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is because I do find that again,</v>

1349
00:55:16.031 --> 00:55:16.864
<v Speaker 1>while we come from different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we literally come from different </v>

1350
00:55:18.491 --> 00:55:21.580
<v Speaker 1>countries but come from different </v>
<v Speaker 1>political parts of this that you really,</v>

1351
00:55:21.581 --> 00:55:24.100
<v Speaker 1>at least in American media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only get one gay,</v>

1352
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:24.993
<v Speaker 1>only one gay gets out there and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bravo gay that's either on tv because </v>

1353
00:55:28.421 --> 00:55:29.254
<v Speaker 1>they're a Fashionista or they're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sidekick to one of the housewives or </v>

1354
00:55:33.371 --> 00:55:36.100
<v Speaker 1>they're somehow involved in pop culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1355
00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Or every now and again someone can break</v>
<v Speaker 1>free like an Anderson Cooper,</v>

1356
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.700
<v Speaker 1>but then sort of have to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>asexual,</v>

1357
00:55:42.701 --> 00:55:44.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never talk about their life.</v>

1358
00:55:44.801 --> 00:55:48.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is sort of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we both break that,</v>

1359
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.780
<v Speaker 1>that paradigm.</v>

1360
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's probably because we are</v>

1361
00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:52.863
<v Speaker 2>cultural libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would certainly describe myself as </v>

1362
00:55:54.671 --> 00:55:57.610
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd probably agree with that.</v>

1363
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that we are those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurgent,</v>

1364
00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:02.560
<v Speaker 2>countercultural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new media personalities.</v>

1365
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.830
<v Speaker 2>We exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may not like to hear this,</v>

1366
00:56:05.831 --> 00:56:08.770
<v Speaker 2>but we exist on a spectrum with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like trump and ann coulter,</v>

1367
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:09.883
<v Speaker 2>a motor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably only went more on the </v>

1368
00:56:10.511 --> 00:56:11.344
<v Speaker 2>serious end of it simply in tapping into</v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary people's frustrations with the </v>

1369
00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 2>limits and absurdities of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1370
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:21.610
<v Speaker 2>what they see on broadcast television </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they read in the newspapers.</v>

1371
00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:22.683
<v Speaker 2>There is an alternative way of having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion which is more honest and </v>

1372
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:25.804
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1373
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.191
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1374
00:56:27.191 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 2>this kind of thing could not happen on </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast television for example.</v>

1375
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:31.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem for the media.</v>

1376
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:31.834
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly one of the reasons everybody </v>

1377
00:56:33.671 --> 00:56:34.450
<v Speaker 2>hates them.</v>

1378
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1379
00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.013
<v Speaker 2>and I think we both started taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of that fact as far as </v>

1380
00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 2>sexuality goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I find interesting about,</v>

1381
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:42.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liberal and conservative homosexual </v>

1382
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:44.463
<v Speaker 2>agreeing on so much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism is that from my point </v>

1383
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:52.270
<v Speaker 2>of view of homosexuality is where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment and you know,</v>

1384
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.313
<v Speaker 2>Drag Queen Culture for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is all about pushing the boundaries of </v>

1385
00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 2>acceptable language and thought we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the threats to freedom of speech.</v>

1386
00:56:59.171 --> 00:57:00.004
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see the authoritarian threat of </v>

1387
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.823
<v Speaker 2>coming over the horizon a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>before anybody else and we're in a </v>

1388
00:57:05.561 --> 00:57:07.720
<v Speaker 2>position to warn other people about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1389
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.630
<v Speaker 2>and as a very serious point about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not just that,</v>

1390
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transsexuals to hate drag queens,</v>

1391
00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:14.254
<v Speaker 2>which is one front in this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive fracturing because drag </v>

1392
00:57:16.541 --> 00:57:17.261
<v Speaker 2>queens loves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1393
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:19.240
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of no holds bar Joan River </v>
<v Speaker 2>style comedy,</v>

1394
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:20.800
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the essence of,</v>

1395
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.110
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of gay identity,</v>

1396
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:22.953
<v Speaker 2>sort of pushing those boundaries in </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimentation and transgender people </v>

1397
00:57:26.891 --> 00:57:28.690
<v Speaker 2>who have kind of fallen into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian mode,</v>

1398
00:57:28.691 --> 00:57:29.524
<v Speaker 2>hate that kind of stuff.</v>

1399
00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:31.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about that,</v>

1400
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:32.674
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about our community fracturing if </v>

1401
00:57:33.191 --> 00:57:34.024
<v Speaker 2>you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also that we see some of the </v>

1402
00:57:35.591 --> 00:57:38.080
<v Speaker 2>serious consequences to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>infringements on,</v>

1403
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:42.580
<v Speaker 2>on culture because of course politics is</v>
<v Speaker 2>downstream from culture and what becomes</v>

1404
00:57:42.581 --> 00:57:43.414
<v Speaker 2>not unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sans Politics becomes unacceptable to </v>

1405
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:45.604
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what becomes unacceptable in culture </v>

1406
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.680
<v Speaker 2>becomes an and politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1407
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:49.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we recognize and we see the warning </v>

1408
00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.313
<v Speaker 2>signs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're sort of the canary in the coal </v>

1409
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:54.131
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1410
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gamers did this too,</v>

1411
00:57:56.651 --> 00:57:58.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gamers engaged very,</v>

1412
00:57:58.511 --> 00:58:01.870
<v Speaker 2>very similarly because gamers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>marginalized people in many cases.</v>

1413
00:58:01.871 --> 00:58:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm just proportionately ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority,</v>

1414
00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:04.774
<v Speaker 2>just fortunately gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately transgender in my </v>

1415
00:58:06.071 --> 00:58:06.904
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Often marginalized personalities are </v>

1416
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:09.303
<v Speaker 2>often people who are retreating into </v>
<v Speaker 2>video games maybe because they have </v>

1417
00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.660
<v Speaker 2>great social skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often very bright,</v>

1418
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.750
<v Speaker 2>sort of brilliant kind of autistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1419
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.673
<v Speaker 2>methodical.</v>

1420
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm very male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant minds and very funny,</v>

1421
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes don't have those social </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills.</v>

1422
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.793
<v Speaker 2>And in that way they're quite similar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>gates because they had to occupy a </v>

1423
00:58:25.781 --> 00:58:26.614
<v Speaker 2>fairly unique position in the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of society and I think gamers </v>

1424
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:33.760
<v Speaker 2>did in their own industry what gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people ought to be doing in public life,</v>

1425
00:58:33.761 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 2>which is precisely that being a canary </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the coal mine and saying,</v>

1426
00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:36.844
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sort of nannying hectoring </v>

1427
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:41.163
<v Speaker 2>language policing that's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive media today is a problem as </v>

1428
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:44.830
<v Speaker 2>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

1429
00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the first signs are the policing</v>

1430
00:58:47.771 --> 00:58:49.750
<v Speaker 2>of gay sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a piece in,</v>

1431
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 2>in the daily beast I think that said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1432
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:53.794
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men who express a racial preference on </v>

1433
00:58:56.601 --> 00:58:57.434
<v Speaker 2>their grindr profile are racist now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously an absurd thing to say </v>

1434
00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 2>it's completely stupid and it was some </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot middle class white woman,</v>

1435
00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who decided that she was going to police</v>

1436
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.600
<v Speaker 2>gay sexuality today just as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1437
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:10.360
<v Speaker 2>just as we were getting to a position of</v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance,</v>

1438
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:11.194
<v Speaker 2>suddenly there's someone coming up </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming over the horizon to police gay </v>

1439
00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening for two reasons.</v>

1440
00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.330
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay.</v>

1441
00:59:16.331 --> 00:59:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Men have high status in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become very molly cold,</v>

1442
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:20.014
<v Speaker 2>very celebrated in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've sort of acquired a kind of </v>

1443
00:59:22.491 --> 00:59:23.324
<v Speaker 2>privilege and when the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left is constantly engaged in the </v>

1444
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:28.400
<v Speaker 2>business of ranking people according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their oppression rating.</v>

1445
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 2>And Gay men don't school very well in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those games because,</v>

1446
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.193
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we looked,</v>

1447
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.150
<v Speaker 2>we looked good and we have money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're know we're,</v>

1448
00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 2>we've basically become another kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>white man.</v>

1449
00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:38.063
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would say that basically the </v>

1450
00:59:38.621 --> 00:59:39.454
<v Speaker 1>progressives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as I'm now calling them the </v>

1451
00:59:40.421 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 1>regressives basically you're done with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gays.</v>

1452
00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1453
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.720
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the world game sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1454
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.250
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all for it done with you now</v>

1455
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.200
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1456
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.033
<v Speaker 2>they've got your gay marriage and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are going to find increasingly that </v>

1457
00:59:52.261 --> 00:59:53.094
<v Speaker 2>they come off to you and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come after you because you're being </v>

1458
00:59:54.751 --> 00:59:56.580
<v Speaker 2>too racially insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna come after you because you</v>

1459
00:59:56.581 --> 00:59:58.770
<v Speaker 2>use the wrong pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to come after you absurdly</v>

1460
00:59:58.771 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 2>and brilliantly for massage one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1461
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people,</v>

1462
01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.810
<v Speaker 2>people make arguments to me sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they say,</v>

1463
01:00:03.811 --> 01:00:04.644
<v Speaker 2>and it's not as credible in your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can understand how we construct </v>

1464
01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:07.644
<v Speaker 2>the argument as bonkers as is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they make arguments that basically </v>

1465
01:00:09.631 --> 01:00:10.780
<v Speaker 2>boiled down to your sacrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Associates do,</v>

1466
01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:11.980
<v Speaker 2>you went gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1467
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:12.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1468
01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:13.860
<v Speaker 2>you hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hate women so much.</v>

1469
01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I can tell why you while you sleep with </v>
<v Speaker 2>men now happens to be that.</v>

1470
01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I do think there's a large element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice in my sexual orientation,</v>

1471
01:00:19.771 --> 01:00:22.050
<v Speaker 2>although that goes entirely against a </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive consensus.</v>

1472
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.120
<v Speaker 2>We'll do a whole thing on that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another show,</v>

1473
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.033
<v Speaker 2>but it's an extraordinary thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they now coming off to gay people for </v>

1474
01:00:28.351 --> 01:00:30.840
<v Speaker 2>being misogynistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for being racist or sorts.</v>

1475
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Your no longer of any use to your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>site,</v>

1476
01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:34.283
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have used you and they have a </v>

1477
01:00:36.271 --> 01:00:37.690
<v Speaker 2>wedding ring on your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1478
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:42.030
<v Speaker 2>they have domesticated view like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would a dog like you did your dog.</v>

1479
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.130
<v Speaker 2>They have put you in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1480
01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:44.993
<v Speaker 2>they have made sure you got the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics that you say the right things </v>

1481
01:00:46.441 --> 01:00:49.320
<v Speaker 2>in public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have domesticated and delineated.</v>

1482
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.333
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the sort of useful liberal gay </v>

1483
01:00:52.891 --> 01:00:53.724
<v Speaker 2>idiots and put them all in little </v>
<v Speaker 2>ghettos in cities like the Castro and </v>

1484
01:00:56.671 --> 01:01:00.070
<v Speaker 2>West Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now you are the product and the um,</v>

1485
01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.370
<v Speaker 2>and the chattel of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the liberal.</v>

1486
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:05.760
<v Speaker 2>So I know both into you don't mean me </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>

1487
01:01:05.761 --> 01:01:06.594
<v Speaker 2>Now I do know they know I do many news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know that I stand for into all </v>

1488
01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:10.021
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1489
01:01:10.021 --> 01:01:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I stand again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it a sort of gay marriage as a way of</v>

1490
01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:13.420
<v Speaker 2>controlling gate.</v>

1491
01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect that along the way,</v>

1492
01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:16.504
<v Speaker 1>if you met the right person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want to marry that person for </v>

1493
01:01:19.211 --> 01:01:20.380
<v Speaker 1>all the romance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1494
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I might move them into the west wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't marry them.</v>

1495
01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.331
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1496
01:01:25.331 --> 01:01:26.164
<v Speaker 1>So we do have to wrap up here and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way we could have done three hours here </v>

1497
01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>and we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do this again for sure.</v>

1498
01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>At this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get to this,</v>

1499
01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:33.003
<v Speaker 1>this piece that has been the throughline</v>
<v Speaker 1>to everything we've been discussing </v>

1500
01:01:35.351 --> 01:01:36.184
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1501
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>this authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left this,</v>

1502
01:01:38.431 --> 01:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>this regressive piece where there have </v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem relentless.</v>

1503
01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:43.623
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could use the example of the gay </v>

1504
01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>rights groups here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1505
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:47.823
<v Speaker 1>glad or the HRC who will relent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will attack the pizza makers </v>

1506
01:01:50.771 --> 01:01:51.604
<v Speaker 1>relentlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll say nothing when gays are </v>

1507
01:01:53.081 --> 01:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>thrown off the roof in Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Iran,</v>

1508
01:01:55.421 --> 01:01:56.254
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Kind of</v>

1510
01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.980
<v Speaker 2>gay speak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1511
01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:00.023
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only guy there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a sort of person in America </v>

1512
01:02:02.311 --> 01:02:02.940
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry to interrupt you,</v>

1513
01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.773
<v Speaker 2>but there's this sort of person in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America today who is a homosexual </v>

1514
01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:08.190
<v Speaker 2>discrimination against it's gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives.</v>

1515
01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:09.243
<v Speaker 2>It was much more difficult to admit </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a gay conservative then you just </v>

1516
01:02:11.001 --> 01:02:11.321
<v Speaker 2>met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gay,</v>

1517
01:02:11.321 --> 01:02:11.971
<v Speaker 2>you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gay,</v>

1518
01:02:11.971 --> 01:02:13.590
<v Speaker 2>you get slaps on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get applause.</v>

1519
01:02:13.591 --> 01:02:14.101
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh whoa.</v>

1520
01:02:14.101 --> 01:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Is Me Brave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1521
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:16.343
<v Speaker 2>all of the sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the social signaling about being </v>

1522
01:02:17.461 --> 01:02:21.210
<v Speaker 2>homosexual is positive with one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a conservative other gays,</v>

1523
01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>the gay establishment and brainstorm </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice wrote an amazing essay about this</v>

1524
01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:25.644
<v Speaker 2>in out magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called something like in the rain </v>

1525
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:29.100
<v Speaker 2>and the magical gail that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>should read.</v>

1526
01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:29.943
<v Speaker 2>It explains how the gay establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically now done with gays </v>

1527
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:38.350
<v Speaker 2>and it's sort of a self perpetuating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of institutions to,</v>

1528
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.353
<v Speaker 2>to push leftist socialist principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got nothing to do with gay rights </v>

1529
01:02:41.071 --> 01:02:42.360
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1530
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.470
<v Speaker 2>we'll treat you as what you would call </v>
<v Speaker 2>an uncle Tom in race terms.</v>

1531
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:47.371
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1532
01:02:47.371 --> 01:02:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I have never in my career as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposeful provocateur.</v>

1533
01:02:51.061 --> 01:02:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't play the victim on twitter or in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my columns because,</v>

1534
01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:54.114
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should,</v>

1535
01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 2>if you should take as well as you gave </v>
<v Speaker 2>them a rule,</v>

1536
01:02:57.751 --> 01:02:59.840
<v Speaker 2>all gay people on quite early in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1537
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but you think that one thing</v>

1538
01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:04.760
<v Speaker 1>that's shifting,</v>

1539
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really long quietly.</v>

1540
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:07.741
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1541
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:08.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1542
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I think you should be able to take it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>given.</v>

1543
01:03:11.501 --> 01:03:12.334
<v Speaker 2>And I never played the victim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never had so much really </v>

1544
01:03:15.721 --> 01:03:16.554
<v Speaker 2>poisonous vitriolic nastiness as from </v>
<v Speaker 2>other gays who think that my politics </v>

1545
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:20.964
<v Speaker 2>are wrong.</v>

1546
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:23.760
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did the ultimate success here?</v>

1547
01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:24.594
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been arguing for a while now that </v>

1548
01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:27.900
<v Speaker 1>by gay marriage being legal now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1549
01:03:27.901 --> 01:03:28.820
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the longterm,</v>

1550
01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:29.663
<v Speaker 1>you actually help the Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this was such an idiotic issue </v>

1551
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>for so many people have to vote us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that I had to vote on it.</v>

1552
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that it was the deciding factor,</v>

1553
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.233
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to vote on whether I could get </v>

1554
01:03:40.561 --> 01:03:42.920
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking nonsensical and,</v>

1555
01:03:42.921 --> 01:03:43.754
<v Speaker 1>and painful and pathetic way to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I actually think ultimately this may </v>

1556
01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>turn into a net win for the Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

1557
01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's the case now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written about this,</v>

1558
01:03:51.651 --> 01:03:53.520
<v Speaker 2>and I call it minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the way in which,</v>

1559
01:03:53.521 --> 01:03:54.354
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the last 10 years was about setting </v>

1560
01:03:55.221 --> 01:03:56.054
<v Speaker 2>men and women against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next 10 years about all sorts of </v>

1561
01:03:57.231 --> 01:03:58.510
<v Speaker 2>other minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1562
01:03:58.690 --> 01:03:59.523
<v Speaker 2>when the Hispanic population in the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are not encumbered by the guilt of </v>

1563
01:04:02.001 --> 01:04:05.240
<v Speaker 2>slavery become the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demographic majority,</v>

1564
01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:08.210
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see some pretty brutal </v>
<v Speaker 2>policing in places like Ferguson.</v>

1565
01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1566
01:04:09.411 --> 01:04:12.320
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>white middle class guilt about,</v>

1567
01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:13.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1568
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:14.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter.</v>

1569
01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:15.374
<v Speaker 2>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1570
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Hispanic mayors in barely a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>

1571
01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be paying multimillion </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar settlements to black families.</v>

1572
01:04:21.921 --> 01:04:23.480
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna be sending police in with </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

1573
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1574
01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:25.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1575
01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.593
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of horrible things on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the horizon and it's driven by the </v>

1576
01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:31.670
<v Speaker 2>identity politics of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are crumbling but not fast enough.</v>

1577
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>My serious point about all of this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cultural libertarianism or should I</v>

1578
01:04:37.701 --> 01:04:39.320
<v Speaker 2>keep banging on about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is what we've sort of what</v>

1579
01:04:39.321 --> 01:04:40.154
<v Speaker 2>we've been talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a word that I'm glad is </v>

1580
01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:43.950
<v Speaker 2>catching on with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we just do it?</v>

1581
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.983
<v Speaker 1>I know you named a few of them before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if from the article that I saw on </v>

1582
01:04:46.581 --> 01:04:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that it was a brilliant article.</v>

1583
01:04:48.111 --> 01:04:49.670
<v Speaker 1>We'll link to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like either way,</v>

1584
01:04:49.671 --> 01:04:50.504
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But can we just name a couple of these </v>

1585
01:04:51.441 --> 01:04:52.274
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you named a few,</v>

1586
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>but Bill Maher was included.</v>

1587
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Chris rock is in there even though he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does rely a lot on his,</v>

1588
01:04:57.950 --> 01:05:00.200
<v Speaker 2>on his blackness as a source of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

1589
01:05:00.201 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 2>He noted that he is somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1590
01:05:01.951 --> 01:05:02.784
<v Speaker 2>who's spoken up about the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness or colleges and college </v>

1591
01:05:05.181 --> 01:05:06.014
<v Speaker 2>campuses and says you won't perform for </v>
<v Speaker 2>students anymore because they're too </v>

1592
01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:10.010
<v Speaker 2>touchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he understands this.</v>

1593
01:05:10.011 --> 01:05:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I think Eli Roth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1594
01:05:11.001 --> 01:05:12.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horror director,</v>

1595
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Adam Baldwin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a sort of a fancy actor and um,</v>

1596
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.640
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not with the Gamergate stuff.</v>

1597
01:05:18.641 --> 01:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got the way these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>normally work because you've got sort of</v>

1598
01:05:21.371 --> 01:05:22.204
<v Speaker 2>vanguard of hell races like me and Katie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins in the UK and Coulter perhaps </v>

1599
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.730
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1600
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>now that all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those three happened to be right wing.</v>

1601
01:05:29.711 --> 01:05:30.544
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can play well that </v>

1602
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:33.430
<v Speaker 2>thing you can place people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political spectrum.</v>

1603
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.263
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I wanted you to mention </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the names because what I liked </v>

1604
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.020
<v Speaker 2>about the article was that these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were from all over.</v>

1605
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:38.943
<v Speaker 2>I think the hell raisers tends to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative today simply because the </v>

1606
01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 2>establishment is liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1607
01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:43.973
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why then a further </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind that you've got the more </v>

1608
01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:47.344
<v Speaker 2>politically ambiguous figures like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff summers at the American </v>

1609
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Enterprise Institute or Cathy young </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist journalist,</v>

1610
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who aren't so easy to place politically.</v>

1611
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Kathy's definitely a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Christina is.</v>

1612
01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Christina is a registered Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1613
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.223
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1614
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:02.680
<v Speaker 2>but who nonetheless recognize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>excesses and they sort of in the wake of</v>

1615
01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:03.514
<v Speaker 2>the chaos created by the hell raisers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people like me kind of winding </v>

1616
01:06:06.011 --> 01:06:07.520
<v Speaker 2>people up and being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1617
01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.733
<v Speaker 2>sort of viciously teasing people I </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider to be dangerous and damaging </v>

1618
01:06:11.561 --> 01:06:13.060
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave half of it.</v>

1619
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.160
<v Speaker 2>But you're throwing bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1620
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:14.440
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1621
01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I believe all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe all of it,</v>

1622
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:17.253
<v Speaker 2>but I'm perfectly happy to accept that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>will say at the most productive way </v>

1623
01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:20.680
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1624
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:24.010
<v Speaker 2>because I think the only responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only appropriate response to outrage</v>

1625
01:06:24.011 --> 01:06:25.180
<v Speaker 2>culture is to be outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1626
01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:27.160
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to tell me that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make jokes about,</v>

1627
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.150
<v Speaker 2>about skin color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will come back at you,</v>

1628
01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1629
01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 2>with 10 poems about me being obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with black penises or whatever.</v>

1630
01:06:34.781 --> 01:06:35.531
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the record,</v>

1631
01:06:35.531 --> 01:06:38.810
<v Speaker 2>you brought a six foot six black porn </v>
<v Speaker 2>star.</v>

1632
01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:41.843
<v Speaker 2>I hired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hired a black porn star just because </v>

1633
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:46.660
<v Speaker 2>it would annoy the right people to be my</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodyguard because I get.</v>

1634
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.310
<v Speaker 2>But I get death and bomb threats </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere I go.</v>

1635
01:06:48.311 --> 01:06:49.144
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't make a big song and dance </v>
<v Speaker 2>about accept to laugh at how stupid it </v>

1636
01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:54.490
<v Speaker 2>is when I didn't believe any feminist </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb threats ever going to be credible.</v>

1637
01:06:54.491 --> 01:06:56.080
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of in Tyler and shoelaces </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

1638
01:06:56.081 --> 01:06:56.914
<v Speaker 2>let alone wire a detonator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about getting blown up </v>

1639
01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:01.420
<v Speaker 2>by feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1640
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.590
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

1641
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:03.483
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am worried about is the chilling effect </v>

1642
01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 2>that they have on free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just get back to the point.</v>

1643
01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay people,</v>

1644
01:07:08.531 --> 01:07:09.364
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is something in which </v>

1645
01:07:10.091 --> 01:07:11.860
<v Speaker 2>you and I are united,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1646
01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:14.440
<v Speaker 2>having privileged access if you'd like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1647
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the limits of acceptable speech and </v>

1648
01:07:16.811 --> 01:07:17.740
<v Speaker 2>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that great,</v>

1649
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:19.840
<v Speaker 2>that great drag Queen Joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1650
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:22.070
<v Speaker 2>which I love from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1651
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.953
<v Speaker 2>from Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which always gets shocks and a national </v>

1652
01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:27.010
<v Speaker 2>newspaper wouldn't let me publish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

1653
01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she comes on stage and she says,</v>

1654
01:07:29.501 --> 01:07:30.190
<v Speaker 2>you're like my new hair.</v>

1655
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 2>It's called the Whitney black and died </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bath.</v>

1656
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.420
<v Speaker 2>And we will get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of horrified.</v>

1657
01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.480
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gave,</v>

1658
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:38.750
<v Speaker 2>gave people live and love though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1659
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we see before everybody else,</v>

1660
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:42.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the serious consequences of this </v>

1661
01:07:44.081 --> 01:07:46.510
<v Speaker 2>sort of chilling effect on free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be and those consequences are,</v>

1662
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1663
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:49.300
<v Speaker 2>the sum total of human human knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever,</v>

1664
01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:50.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to be caught off.</v>

1665
01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Js mill classical liberal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscionable to modern feminism.</v>

1666
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:59.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe some of the central </v>
<v Speaker 2>tenants of know on which British society</v>

1667
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:01.570
<v Speaker 2>was built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is dangerous stuff.</v>

1668
01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.570
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous stuff because of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in universities too.</v>

1669
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just look at the sorts of,</v>

1670
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:07.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the,</v>

1671
01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:10.870
<v Speaker 2>the feminists hegemony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1672
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:12.370
<v Speaker 2>women's studies departments that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1673
01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.440
<v Speaker 2>that run rampant on campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yale,</v>

1674
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope</v>

1675
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 3>this is true and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm misremembering this,</v>

1676
01:08:18.471 --> 01:08:20.270
<v Speaker 3>but I saw something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1677
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Deray Mckesson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black lives matter.</v>

1678
01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 3>This guy is teaching a course at Yale </v>
<v Speaker 3>and defensive looting,</v>

1679
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:26.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this kind of stuff.</v>

1680
01:08:26.221 --> 01:08:27.900
<v Speaker 3>This is a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1681
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:30.050
<v Speaker 3>So tweet about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's real,</v>

1682
01:08:30.051 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 3>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the women's studies suffered,</v>

1683
01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:36.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many decent universities is scary.</v>

1684
01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:39.330
<v Speaker 3>It's denying human knowledge is making </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1685
01:08:39.331 --> 01:08:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And been this stuff makes it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>government policy regarding match.</v>

1686
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.400
<v Speaker 3>You're not just talking about women's </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies though,</v>

1687
01:08:43.401 --> 01:08:44.570
<v Speaker 3>because this is coming from all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

1688
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:48.500
<v Speaker 3>like Berkeley Protesting Bill Maher </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming as a progressive ISM.</v>

1689
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

1690
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.333
<v Speaker 3>I've just seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm supposed to speak at USC tomorrow </v>

1691
01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:54.710
<v Speaker 3>night and I've just seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1692
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this horrendous blog post from somebody </v>

1693
01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:00.620
<v Speaker 3>who says that I'm a sort of misogynistic</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate speech much.</v>

1694
01:09:00.621 --> 01:09:04.040
<v Speaker 3>And because I made a joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what it was.</v>

1695
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 3>It's probably some joke like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1696
01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.100
<v Speaker 3>feminist barbies just come out when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>pull the cord.</v>

1697
01:09:08.101 --> 01:09:09.860
<v Speaker 3>It says math is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's lie about rape.</v>

1698
01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:10.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1699
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some joke like that,</v>

1700
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they.</v>

1701
01:09:13.311 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 3>And they picked me out some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>misogynistic worth their words.</v>

1702
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:17.264
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the takeaway and that </v>

1703
01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:20.820
<v Speaker 3>that's really where I sort of wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>end this with you because yeah,</v>

1704
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:21.703
<v Speaker 3>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything I've tried to do with this </v>

1705
01:09:23.021 --> 01:09:26.600
<v Speaker 3>show so far is show that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with people and we can,</v>

1706
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:30.860
<v Speaker 3>we can go back and argue the tenants of </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminism or whether I think you're right</v>

1707
01:09:30.861 --> 01:09:33.320
<v Speaker 3>or wrong about men being oppressed or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1708
01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:35.150
<v Speaker 3>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gay marriage thing,</v>

1709
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:36.680
<v Speaker 3>all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1710
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:39.350
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but allow the conversation to happen and</v>

1711
01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:40.184
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what's happening and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the cultural libertarians </v>

1712
01:09:42.201 --> 01:09:43.400
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1713
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.210
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to have the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I appreciate you coming in and I want</v>
