1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.533
<v Speaker 1>As I sit here in the middle of February,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about eight months away from </v>

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Election Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that sound completely insane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:11.124
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been talking about this election </v>

5
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>for at least a year and we're still over</v>
<v Speaker 1>half a year away from it.</v>

6
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:17.454
<v Speaker 1>That is completely bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much of the election process is just </v>

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.673
<v Speaker 1>insider nonsense and day to day per so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to focus on what issues are </v>

8
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.394
<v Speaker 1>actually important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does the 24 hour cable news </v>

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>cycle thrive on election drama and </v>
<v Speaker 1>distractions,</v>

10
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>but the entire process of electing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians seems to be built on getting</v>

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>the people to actually never talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big issues in an honest way.</v>

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>We have debates with catered questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no actual debating.</v>

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.563
<v Speaker 1>We have town halls which are just forums</v>
<v Speaker 1>for talking points and social media </v>

14
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.344
<v Speaker 1>campaigns to spread candidates messages </v>
<v Speaker 1>without ever explaining how their ideas </v>

15
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>will actually solve anything.</v>

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.183
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a strange collusion between the </v>

17
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.194
<v Speaker 1>media and politicians to keep us all in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark about what's really going on </v>

18
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:02.274
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I actually want to hear candidates </v>

19
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.824
<v Speaker 1>talking about are big ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Political talking points to explain </v>

20
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>their economic philosophy and how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to be,</v>

21
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.753
<v Speaker 1>to say how they came up with a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for or against abortion and to </v>

22
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>let us know why America's role in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world should be larger or smaller.</v>

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.913
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big ideas don't fit into 32nd </v>

24
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>soundbites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving us with a media that wants views</v>

25
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:25.644
<v Speaker 1>and clicks instead of substantive debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a political class who of course are </v>

26
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.114
<v Speaker 1>all the happier to provide meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>slogans that sound good in a headline </v>

27
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.343
<v Speaker 1>but don't mean anything at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That brings me to the two people really </v>

28
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>shaking up the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this point.</v>

29
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.773
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie says he wants a political </v>

30
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

31
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>While trump says he wants to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>America great again,</v>

32
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I doubt they'll ever be another </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate like Bernie,</v>

33
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:54.621
<v Speaker 1>a world weary lifelong politician who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to fundamentally change how things</v>

34
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:58.710
<v Speaker 1>operate from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you agree or disagree with him.</v>

35
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a powerful message that of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is trump,</v>

36
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:02.334
<v Speaker 1>a billionaire who's using years of board</v>
<v Speaker 1>room and TV experience to give his </v>

37
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:06.744
<v Speaker 1>supporters whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they don't know exactly what </v>

38
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what these two men have in common though</v>

39
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:12.864
<v Speaker 1>is more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both openly mock the powerful and </v>

40
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:16.494
<v Speaker 1>corrupting influence of money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics while only existing as </v>

41
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>legitimate contenders because of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>very existence.</v>

42
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.393
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be lost on us that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the very strength of our </v>

43
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:26.814
<v Speaker 1>democratic system that allows to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to totally upend it to be </v>

44
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>surging in the polls and as warped as </v>
<v Speaker 1>our system is.</v>

45
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.403
<v Speaker 1>If the two guys who were the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>plainspoken who were being heard the </v>

46
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:37.404
<v Speaker 1>loudest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although the countdown to election 2016 </v>

47
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:40.134
<v Speaker 1>frustrates me as a political junkie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't pretend that I don't enjoy the </v>

48
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.704
<v Speaker 1>clown show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a soap opera with characters you </v>

49
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>just can't make up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>we've got the ex president's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Socialist Jew,</v>

51
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:50.124
<v Speaker 1>the billionaire and the neurosurgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically sounds like a spinoff of </v>

52
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Gilligan's island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

53
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>while Gilligan and his friends were </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually rescued from their island,</v>

54
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>the only ones who can rescue from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shipwreck ourselves,</v>

55
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>the citizens to help me navigate these </v>
<v Speaker 1>choppy waters this week is my guest,</v>

56
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the editor@largeofBreitbart.com.</v>

57
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.603
<v Speaker 1>Many of you have asked us to have a sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to dig into some of his </v>

58
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:13.534
<v Speaker 1>conservative ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can have liberal and a conservative </v>

59
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>coexist well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If thirstin howl,</v>

60
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:18.394
<v Speaker 1>the third and ginger could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling that ben and I will be </v>

61
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>able to as well.</v>

62
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.253
<v Speaker 1>Every election year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians remind us that their </v>

63
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>election is the most important of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

64
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Usually that's just more hyperbole </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense,</v>

65
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>but this time it could actually be true </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of who wins,</v>

66
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>whether it's one of these to hillary or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeb or the skipper.</v>

67
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Our system is fundamentally shaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

68
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>as evidenced by both the sanders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump surgeries.</v>

69
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.413
<v Speaker 1>Can we address real issues in the months</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come or will we keep talking about </v>

70
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:47.464
<v Speaker 1>sideshow nonsense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we get a fair election system or </v>

71
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:50.884
<v Speaker 1>will big donors always run the show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we elect officials who will </v>

72
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.274
<v Speaker 1>compromise to make the country stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>or will partisan points always win the </v>

73
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.294
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are just a few of the huge issues </v>

74
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>we have to discuss and that's not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>touching on immigration,</v>

75
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.293
<v Speaker 1>healthcare and terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people mock the idea of </v>

76
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>American exceptionalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the left,</v>

77
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>but I actually do believe in it.</v>

78
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.073
<v Speaker 1>There has never been a country in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the globe that is taken more </v>

79
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>people from across the world and help </v>
<v Speaker 1>them make a better life for themselves,</v>

80
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>their children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their children's children.</v>

81
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Even now with all of our problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people still want to come to America for</v>

82
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>a better life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have massive issues,</v>

83
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.293
<v Speaker 1>but underneath it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bedrock based in democratic </v>

84
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>principles which still makes our </v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the world truly unique.</v>

85
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean America can or should </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the world what to do,</v>

86
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to be fairer,</v>

87
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>freer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more functional whenever we can.</v>

88
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.763
<v Speaker 1>All of these reasons are why I've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>this show about ideas and not my new </v>

89
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:48.184
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an endless cycle of noise </v>

90
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>designed to keep us distracted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided.</v>

91
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Our politicians will only be better if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we demand they be better.</v>

92
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Will only demand our politicians be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better if we are better ourselves.</v>

93
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>As you guys know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to say the two things can be true</v>

94
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can have a political revolution</v>

95
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>while at the same time making America </v>
<v Speaker 1>great again.</v>

96
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.413
<v Speaker 1>This change doesn't start with trump and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanders though it starts with the </v>

97
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>government of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the people and for the people.</v>

98
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Just as the great Gilligan once said,</v>

99
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.440
<v Speaker 2>my</v>

100
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.710
<v Speaker 1>guest this week is editor in chief of </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily wire.com,</v>

101
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.633
<v Speaker 1>editor@largeofBreitbart.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a syndicated columnist and radio host </v>

102
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.520
<v Speaker 1>and in New York Times best selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>author.</v>

103
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.150
<v Speaker 1>You want me to throw in anything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got a serious resume.</v>

104
00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing some research on.</v>

105
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.710
<v Speaker 1>You pretty much do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm.</v>

107
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy that you're here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all of twitter basically saying to</v>

108
00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:48.200
<v Speaker 1>me for about six months you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to this guy.</v>

109
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy who will either convert </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to conservatism or you guys are just</v>

110
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.340
<v Speaker 1>going to hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turned into flaming Bernie Sanders.</v>

111
00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

112
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.000
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much pretty sure.</v>

113
00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.893
<v Speaker 3>That's not the direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be a conservative by the end of </v>

114
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 3>the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

115
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.821
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

116
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Let's allocate territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

117
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.840
<v Speaker 3>let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

118
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people also said that even </v>
<v Speaker 3>even liberals that,</v>

119
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.121
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

120
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.954
<v Speaker 3>Have you said I don't agree with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and a lot sometimes I don't even </v>

121
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:12.224
<v Speaker 3>like him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some principle based around </v>

122
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 3>what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty much of what I do here.</v>

123
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I wanted to have you on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for having me.</v>

124
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:21.390
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of requests to come on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

125
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Somebody invited me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

126
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's get to it.</v>

127
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 3>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were actually born in La and brought</v>

128
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 3>up in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought there were no conservatives in</v>

129
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 3>La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell are you doing here?</v>

130
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.723
<v Speaker 3>So my parents were both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They voted for Carter and 76 and they </v>

131
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 3>were Reagan Republicans.</v>

132
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.873
<v Speaker 3>And then because we're orthodox Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious Jews tend to vote Republican </v>

133
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 3>and be culturally conservative and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of the million in which I grew</v>

134
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:43.064
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I became conservative basically from </v>

135
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.661
<v Speaker 3>birth I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

136
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:49.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a new convert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

137
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 3>So how is that growing up a conservative</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a kid?</v>

138
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Because what's that saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

139
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:53.864
<v Speaker 3>if you're not liberal in your twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no a heart and if you're not </v>

140
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.060
<v Speaker 3>conservative and you're 37 or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

141
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.080
<v Speaker 3>how is that as a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

142
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 3>So it works out beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

143
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:03.240
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does,</v>

144
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 3>how is that as a kid growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your conservative as a kid?</v>

145
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't sound.</v>

146
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't sound right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow,</v>

147
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.543
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up in religious communities a </v>

148
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:12.700
<v Speaker 3>little bit different than growing up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a nonreligious communities.</v>

149
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Religious communities tend to be more </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>

150
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 3>And in La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatism is all about social issues,</v>

151
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

152
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.550
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to economics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's kind of the,</v>

153
00:07:20.551 --> 00:07:21.384
<v Speaker 3>the LDLC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people driving around in the </v>

154
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Mercedes Benz with a Bernie sanders </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticker,</v>

155
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:25.064
<v Speaker 3>but everybody knows the full of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a lot of that in beverly hills </v>

156
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

157
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

158
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:30.794
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just drive down to cars for </v>

159
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:32.594
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think any day now just give it away </v>

160
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.873
<v Speaker 3>and you enjoy yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't understand why you need my </v>

161
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You clearly have some of your own.</v>

162
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.624
<v Speaker 3>So anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in la it's all a cultural thing and </v>

163
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:41.774
<v Speaker 3>conservative versus versus leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I like to distinguish leftist from </v>

164
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 3>liberals because I don't think they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>

165
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.303
<v Speaker 3>A conservatives versus leftists in La is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very much about kind of a character </v>

166
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.213
<v Speaker 3>assumption if he or if you're a leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a good person and if you're a </v>

167
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:55.544
<v Speaker 3>conservative that means you're an </v>
<v Speaker 3>uptight John Lithgow type from </v>

168
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 3>footloose.</v>

169
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 3>You don't want anybody to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it comes down to.</v>

170
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.103
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I definitely want to dig into the </v>

171
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:04.230
<v Speaker 3>difference between liberals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftists,</v>

172
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.293
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's something you focused on a </v>

173
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:06.824
<v Speaker 3>lot from the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's something that I've focused on </v>

174
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 3>a lot in the last year from the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to dive into that,</v>

175
00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 3>but let's just do some election stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

176
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.340
<v Speaker 3>First,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get the easy stuff.</v>

177
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.453
<v Speaker 3>Fun stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

178
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 3>so this election seems completely insane</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

179
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's start with trump.</v>

180
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 3>You're big on trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

181
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 3>How you feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that.</v>

182
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 3>I think trump's a loud mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a braggart.</v>

183
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that trump is bad for American politics.</v>

184
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a couple of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I like about trump won,</v>

185
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:35.150
<v Speaker 3>is that he says things that are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically incorrect.</v>

186
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.013
<v Speaker 3>The problem with trump is that he fails </v>
<v Speaker 3>to distinguish politically correct from </v>

187
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 3>just being a jackass.</v>

188
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a difference.</v>

189
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:41.174
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>being rude and being politically </v>

190
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:44.370
<v Speaker 3>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

191
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Being being rude is telling Megan Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's bleeding from her wherever.</v>

192
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Being politically incorrect is saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that some immigrants across our southern</v>

193
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:54.320
<v Speaker 3>border are criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's politically incorrect,</v>

194
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.393
<v Speaker 3>but it's not rude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But saying that Megan Kelly's bleeding </v>

195
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 3>from her wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not politically incorrect.</v>

196
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 3>That's just being a jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

197
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 3>so it was part of it that his people </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistake the two.</v>

198
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.740
<v Speaker 3>So because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the,</v>

199
00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 3>the reign of political correctness is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong,</v>

200
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.073
<v Speaker 3>people have now interpreted being </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically incorrect as just anything </v>

201
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 3>you say that pisses someone off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you're politically incorrect.</v>

202
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's not what political </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrectness is.</v>

203
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.663
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this conflation of just saying </v>

204
00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:18.780
<v Speaker 1>anything and he's really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

205
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed the more I watched him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

206
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:21.934
<v Speaker 1>you can whittle him down to some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic stuff because he just says a lot </v>

207
00:09:25.421 --> 00:09:27.580
<v Speaker 1>of circular logic stuff and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's great,</v>

208
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that person's great and they love me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate me and that and that.</v>

209
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.610
<v Speaker 1>And he was actually never really saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

210
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.990
<v Speaker 1>But that is sort of the genius,</v>

211
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.363
<v Speaker 3>what I don't like about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is the genius of him because we </v>

212
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 3>live in a me culture and to me time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

213
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 3>me media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so trump is all about trump.</v>

214
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

215
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 3>that's really the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>matters to him.</v>

216
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 3>So if latimer potent insults him </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow,</v>

217
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 3>that matters more than a flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unrepentant invade a country because all</v>

218
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:50.124
<v Speaker 3>that matters is trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he speaks about himself in third </v>

219
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 3>person and everything that he talks </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is,</v>

220
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to build a wall,</v>

221
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make a great deal.</v>

222
00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm good for the blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good for the Hispanic.</v>

223
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Speaker 3>Nowhere in there do I hear as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative?</v>

224
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.813
<v Speaker 3>Nowhere in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I hear anything about what's the </v>

225
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 3>proper role of government in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the part that I care about,</v>

226
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

227
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.610
<v Speaker 3>The part I don't care about Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump,</v>

228
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he cares about me.</v>

229
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that we should care about </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other,</v>

230
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 3>but I want him to leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want Barack Obama.</v>

231
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:14.844
<v Speaker 3>I want all these people to leave me </v>
<v Speaker 3>alone so I can live with that for a </v>

232
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 3>conservative principle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just.</v>

233
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just just leave me alone.</v>

234
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Like the government was not meant to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this many things.</v>

235
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:23.903
<v Speaker 3>End of story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean read the Constitution is very </v>

236
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:26.004
<v Speaker 3>explicit about the things government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do and pretty much nothing </v>

237
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:29.544
<v Speaker 3>on trump's list except for maybe border </v>
<v Speaker 3>security is really something that the </v>

238
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 3>government ought to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

239
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that comes down to,</v>

240
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 3>and this is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is I think that what the danger of trump</v>

241
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.463
<v Speaker 3>is that the left for 100 years has </v>
<v Speaker 3>fallen in love with the idea of the </v>

242
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:43.680
<v Speaker 3>strong man.</v>

243
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.513
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go all the way back to Woodrow </v>

244
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.033
<v Speaker 3>Wilson and Woodrow Wilson is writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the president should be the </v>

245
00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:48.444
<v Speaker 3>strongest man possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only limits on his power should be </v>

246
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 3>his vision basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

247
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could come straight from Mussolini and </v>

248
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Woodrow Wilson was actually as close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a dictator is America has ever had,</v>

249
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.540
<v Speaker 3>that's carried through to FDR is credit </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Lbj,</v>

250
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 3>to Obama on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least they made overtures toward.</v>

251
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.063
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to have the strong man </v>
<v Speaker 3>who gets involved in your life and fix </v>

252
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:08.364
<v Speaker 3>all your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump is the strong man and I think </v>

253
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:10.824
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after so many years of a lot of </v>

254
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:12.714
<v Speaker 3>Americans on the right feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>emasculated by President Obama telling </v>

255
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 3>them that they're racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

256
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobes,</v>

257
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 3>and by Hillary Clinton and telling them </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're there to kind of testosterone</v>

258
00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 3>in orientation toward the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>

259
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.213
<v Speaker 3>I wrote this yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the response to trump from </v>

260
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:28.974
<v Speaker 3>the right has basically been he's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest swing instead of balls in the </v>

261
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:31.764
<v Speaker 3>race and because that's what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm forum and you hear that from trump </v>

262
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:34.931
<v Speaker 3>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

263
00:11:34.931 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 3>he'll do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he will.</v>

264
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

265
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.333
<v Speaker 3>Will it be good?</v>

266
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.220
<v Speaker 1>My question is a conservative though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a truth,</v>

267
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.080
<v Speaker 1>this must make you feel crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

268
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean you must be really enraged at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own party because it's looking more</v>

269
00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and more everyday like he's actually to.</v>

270
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

271
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't know to be most pest out </v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>

272
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:54.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you got.</v>

273
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:58.110
<v Speaker 3>You've got the gop establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which can I get off the Jeb Bush,</v>

274
00:11:58.111 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 3>ran for the life of them and then just </v>
<v Speaker 3>unify behind somebody like a Marco Rubio</v>

275
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.343
<v Speaker 3>and hate Ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much they would side with trump over </v>

276
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably cruise to them as too far right</v>

277
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.753
<v Speaker 3>crews and they think he's unelectable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and more than that cruise actually I </v>

278
00:12:10.491 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 3>think believes the things they say they </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe so he says,</v>

279
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:13.834
<v Speaker 3>I believe in small government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we should cut the </v>

280
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:16.144
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the government shouldn't be </v>

281
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:17.674
<v Speaker 3>important in people's lives and the RNC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes its money off government </v>

282
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 3>being important to people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

283
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 3>how much money would you give to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political party if the government didn't</v>

284
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:25.834
<v Speaker 3>matter in your life or the RNC would </v>
<v Speaker 3>raise $0 if no one cared what happened </v>

285
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 3>in Washington DC and so Cruz scares them</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that angle.</v>

286
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think trump scares them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think trump,</v>

287
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 3>trump annoys the establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't scare the establishment,</v>

288
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 3>so I'm annoyed at the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm annoyed at.</v>

289
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cruz is,</v>

290
00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:43.810
<v Speaker 3>is a very good constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>

291
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.913
<v Speaker 3>but he's just an unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a great candidate by any </v>

292
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:47.554
<v Speaker 3>stretch of the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there are the trump people who </v>

293
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 3>are so populist and in love with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

294
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Speaker 3>the feel of trump that they forget that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

295
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.300
<v Speaker 3>that this guy could actually be </v>
<v Speaker 3>president and like if he's president and</v>

296
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.170
<v Speaker 3>what is that going to look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

297
00:12:58.171 --> 00:12:59.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's frustrating.</v>

298
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.483
<v Speaker 3>Definitely all the way across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think maybe the most frustrating </v>

299
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 3>thing of all is that beating trump is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually not that hard.</v>

300
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Trump is a school yard bully and </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody needs to just say to him in the</v>

301
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:10.570
<v Speaker 3>last debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so clear.</v>

302
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.360
<v Speaker 3>If you actually want to stop trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do a job dead,</v>

303
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 3>whichever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

304
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Jeb stood there and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

305
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.241
<v Speaker 3>Donald's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:17.074
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

307
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.113
<v Speaker 3>you're bullying people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also stopping me and my mother </v>

308
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.150
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all trump is.</v>

309
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.013
<v Speaker 3>If my thesis is correct that basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump just represents the balls of </v>

310
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 3>American politics and the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat that as to kick him in the balls.</v>

311
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that figuratively speaking,</v>

312
00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:31.224
<v Speaker 3>it's the only way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he can't really or could work </v>

313
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 3>through and it might work literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

314
00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:35.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

315
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 3>but the only way to really beat him is </v>
<v Speaker 3>for somebody on the stage to say to him,</v>

316
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

317
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.120
<v Speaker 3>you act like a big tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Papa gave you $40,</v>

318
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:43.954
<v Speaker 3>million dollars to play with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've never had anyone say no to you </v>

319
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 3>and your entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a pathetic week specimen.</v>

320
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.473
<v Speaker 3>Every time somebody takes you off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you turned as red as the background on </v>

321
00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 3>that stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other night.</v>

322
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:53.044
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually faded into the woodwork </v>

323
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 3>during that debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if anybody on the stage really needs</v>

324
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 3>to shut the hell up and just listen for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a second,</v>

325
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 3>it might be used since you clearly know </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing about anything.</v>

326
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 3>So what does that tell you about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of these guys?</v>

327
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 3>That nobody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

328
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not in Jim's character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

329
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.273
<v Speaker 3>It's just not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's in any of their </v>

330
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that say then about this,</v>

331
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.260
<v Speaker 3>this group of people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why they lose.</v>

332
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't Obama's character upon would do</v>

333
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 3>it and I think it's actually in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary's character.</v>

334
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.863
<v Speaker 3>I think these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that folks on the left </v>

335
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:21.334
<v Speaker 3>understand that presidential politics is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a knife fight and people on the right </v>

336
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:28.030
<v Speaker 3>are constantly engaged in this game </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's a discussion over policy.</v>

337
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 3>So Jeb Bush this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

338
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.113
<v Speaker 3>he's on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about trump and he says </v>

339
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 3>something to the effect of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

340
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:34.804
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goal as president of the United </v>

341
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.873
<v Speaker 3>States is to grow our GDP from a two </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent growth rate to a four percent </v>

342
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:39.971
<v Speaker 3>growth rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

343
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:40.804
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be trump.</v>

344
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.123
<v Speaker 3>That's solid argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't understand that most </v>

345
00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:46.570
<v Speaker 3>politics comes to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate.</v>

346
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:47.404
<v Speaker 3>This is the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most politics comes down to character </v>

347
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:50.104
<v Speaker 3>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get the character off the </v>

348
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 3>table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can have a good policy argument</v>

349
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.690
<v Speaker 3>that most people on the left like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn and say to people on the right that</v>

350
00:14:56.691 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 3>you are just bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a racist,</v>

351
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>

352
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 3>homophobes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we shouldn't listen to you.</v>

353
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.810
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what trump does so well.</v>

354
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 3>And so what you see on the right is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

355
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:06.440
<v Speaker 3>but you're not a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

356
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 3>that's an argument about policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an argument about character.</v>

357
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for a guy that obviously doesn't like</v>

358
00:15:11.341 --> 00:15:12.174
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you at least envy the fact that in </v>

359
00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:16.044
<v Speaker 1>their debates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's much more </v>

360
00:15:17.821 --> 00:15:19.230
<v Speaker 1>substantive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's at least,</v>

361
00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:20.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really saying I'm the </v>

362
00:15:20.881 --> 00:15:23.820
<v Speaker 1>progressive on the progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you may hate all progressive ideas,</v>

363
00:15:23.821 --> 00:15:25.200
<v Speaker 1>but at least there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:15:25.201 --> 00:15:25.950
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

365
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.950
<v Speaker 1>you got the d plus from the NRA and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to see her.</v>

366
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.313
<v Speaker 3>So a little more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that they stay away from the </v>

367
00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:32.850
<v Speaker 3>character attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

368
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.510
<v Speaker 3>which I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

369
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Although I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

370
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.360
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Hillary's case,</v>

371
00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:38.194
<v Speaker 3>some character attacks would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary if Bernie actually would like </v>

372
00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:40.714
<v Speaker 3>to win and not just run a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some point he's going to have to say </v>

373
00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:44.074
<v Speaker 3>your corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's sort of saying it though </v>

374
00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:47.770
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a little late,</v>

375
00:15:47.771 --> 00:15:48.231
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

376
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:49.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

377
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.310
<v Speaker 3>she's vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

378
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 3>attacking him as a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

379
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:53.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll say a lot of bad things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders,</v>

380
00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:56.770
<v Speaker 3>but calling Bernie Sanders is racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is absurd.</v>

381
00:15:56.771 --> 00:15:57.604
<v Speaker 3>And then she's so set on I have to win </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ethnic minority vote that I'll send </v>

382
00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:01.324
<v Speaker 3>out my surrogates like David Brock to </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggest he doesn't care about black </v>

383
00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:04.570
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is absurd.</v>

384
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

385
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that I'd like to see a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>more character attacks on the,</v>

386
00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:10.660
<v Speaker 3>on the left in between them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

387
00:16:10.661 --> 00:16:14.110
<v Speaker 3>and as far as policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched a couple of their debates.</v>

388
00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I have yet to see a significant area of </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreement.</v>

389
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:19.480
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just coming at it from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We agree on everything.</v>

390
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.450
<v Speaker 3>It's just a question of how we talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it to Bernie says,</v>

391
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:24.520
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about it honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Hillary says,</v>

392
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:25.354
<v Speaker 3>let's lie about it a little bit so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't really figure out what </v>

393
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:28.990
<v Speaker 3>we're up to and then we'll do it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be too late.</v>

394
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sense at least with them,</v>

395
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:31.624
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hillary's trying to hit </v>

396
00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:34.930
<v Speaker 1>burning on this that you're a big idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

397
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.920
<v Speaker 1>but actually I can get some of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff done now.</v>

398
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:38.763
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that the Republicans would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be any more inclined to say that birth </v>

399
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:41.820
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

400
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean they say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's boring.</v>

401
00:16:42.841 --> 00:16:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kristy was saying that in every debate,</v>

402
00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:45.114
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have Rubio and Cruz go at each </v>

403
00:16:45.781 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 3>other and then there's Chris Christie </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the La Jolla shores.</v>

404
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Governor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>

405
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other.</v>

406
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>

407
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Because it's because it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a dumb thing to do.</v>

408
00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean he sounds like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

409
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.680
<v Speaker 3>he acts like a hick when he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christie,</v>

410
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.740
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a governor of a major </v>
<v Speaker 3>state acting like you don't know how the</v>

411
00:17:01.741 --> 00:17:04.380
<v Speaker 3>political game is played or like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what the Senate does.</v>

412
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know what these people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing about over here.</v>

413
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here I am,</v>

414
00:17:09.181 --> 00:17:10.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do real things like hug Obama.</v>

415
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

416
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.480
<v Speaker 3>So it's all the politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is playing politics right now.</v>

417
00:17:15.481 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 3>At this level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nobody's playing politics like we're</v>

418
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.263
<v Speaker 3>the real ideologies are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I would like to see what I </v>

419
00:17:20.371 --> 00:17:20.850
<v Speaker 3>would love to see.</v>

420
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.610
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be good for the country is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sanders versus Cruz raise.</v>

421
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.813
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would actually be a fascinating </v>

422
00:17:25.321 --> 00:17:26.154
<v Speaker 3>race because at that point may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if standards can stay away from the </v>

423
00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:31.230
<v Speaker 3>whole you're a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

424
00:17:31.231 --> 00:17:32.250
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic thing.</v>

425
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.413
<v Speaker 3>We could actually have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>about whether socialism is a good idea </v>

426
00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:36.234
<v Speaker 3>or a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is income inequality something that we </v>

427
00:17:37.831 --> 00:17:41.880
<v Speaker 3>ought to worry about or is it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramifications of a free market system in</v>

428
00:17:41.881 --> 00:17:43.920
<v Speaker 3>which people make voluntary transactions</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

429
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.350
<v Speaker 3>It's that these would be interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations,</v>

430
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.090
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just don't get to them.</v>

431
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real of ideas</v>

432
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.873
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be if it was sanders and had rand Paul </v>

433
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:55.660
<v Speaker 3>not dropped that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

434
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:56.543
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my problem with Rand Paul was always on </v>

435
00:17:57.241 --> 00:17:58.074
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an isolationist and so ran sort </v>

436
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:01.860
<v Speaker 3>of is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

437
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.460
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

438
00:18:03.461 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 3>that it would be a battle of ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be worthwhile.</v>

439
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Republican Party in general,</v>

440
00:18:07.521 --> 00:18:08.354
<v Speaker 1>and I hear this a lot on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that it's this group of </v>

441
00:18:10.371 --> 00:18:13.940
<v Speaker 1>homophobes and racist and all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been fighting against this.</v>

442
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I've been fighting from the liberal side</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the regressive left.</v>

443
00:18:17.901 --> 00:18:18.381
<v Speaker 1>What I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:19.214
<v Speaker 1>the people that are on the far left to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I saw something interesting that </v>

445
00:18:21.981 --> 00:18:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you retweeted it and remind me who said </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

446
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.913
<v Speaker 1>but somebody made a point of saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this morning Nikki Haley and an Indian </v>

447
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:29.503
<v Speaker 1>American is a and Tim Scott and African </v>
<v Speaker 1>American have both endorsed Marco Rubio </v>

448
00:18:34.641 --> 00:18:36.950
<v Speaker 1>who is Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all Republicans.</v>

449
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.083
<v Speaker 1>So in Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a black person and a Latino and these </v>

450
00:18:41.841 --> 00:18:44.990
<v Speaker 1>are Republicans and Tim Scott is a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican from the south.</v>

451
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Somehow that messaging doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it through,</v>

452
00:18:47.781 --> 00:18:48.110
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

453
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.943
<v Speaker 3>Well it doesn't because they're not real</v>
<v Speaker 3>black people are real Latino's or real </v>

454
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.270
<v Speaker 3>forerunner of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

455
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.680
<v Speaker 3>of foreign extraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

456
00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Nikki Haley was born here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but her parents are from India.</v>

457
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.900
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that never</v>

458
00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 1>the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the point of America?</v>

459
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

460
00:19:00.971 --> 00:19:01.420
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

461
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.253
<v Speaker 3>we've broken down into this identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics that really is quite sad and </v>

462
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.753
<v Speaker 3>traps people in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a group identity rather than you're </v>

463
00:19:08.741 --> 00:19:10.870
<v Speaker 3>an individual go out and make something </v>
<v Speaker 3>of yourself.</v>

464
00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:11.704
<v Speaker 3>Go out and do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a message that it's not </v>

465
00:19:13.601 --> 00:19:15.040
<v Speaker 3>popular in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in certain quarters.</v>

466
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:15.880
<v Speaker 3>When you say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

467
00:19:15.881 --> 00:19:16.714
<v Speaker 3>your life is in your own hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of responsibility that </v>

468
00:19:18.581 --> 00:19:19.414
<v Speaker 3>comes with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you don't get to blame society </v>

469
00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.740
<v Speaker 3>for your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why the.</v>

470
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that the Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

471
00:19:25.211 --> 00:19:27.420
<v Speaker 3>the Hillary Clinton argument is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

472
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's ever,</v>

473
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.503
<v Speaker 3>ever other tweet from Bernie Sanders is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like we live in a world where </v>

474
00:19:32.351 --> 00:19:33.184
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's massive income inequality </v>

475
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.270
<v Speaker 3>and we need to do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think to myself,</v>

476
00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's called a world of reality.</v>

477
00:19:39.371 --> 00:19:40.204
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every society in history has had income </v>

478
00:19:41.531 --> 00:19:43.120
<v Speaker 3>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including communist ones.</v>

479
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.540
<v Speaker 3>And you're not showing me a villain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

480
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:49.210
<v Speaker 3>You're saying reality is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blame Society for all the problems.</v>

481
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Show me an actual villain and I'm happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fight them.</v>

482
00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Show me some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some ghost villain.</v>

483
00:19:53.591 --> 00:19:55.270
<v Speaker 3>And I can't fight goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't.</v>

484
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear that stuff though,</v>

485
00:19:57.031 --> 00:19:57.864
<v Speaker 1>do you acknowledge at some level that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some level of crony capitalism </v>

486
00:20:00.331 --> 00:20:01.164
<v Speaker 1>that keeps making the big companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and crushing all of the small </v>

487
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>companies and I still think he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking to that point,</v>

488
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 1>but I guess he's not doing it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really direct.</v>

489
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were attacking crony capitalism,</v>

490
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:13.214
<v Speaker 3>he and the tea party on the same page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with with the occupy Wall </v>

491
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.233
<v Speaker 3>Street movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was supposedly ripping crony </v>

492
00:20:18.321 --> 00:20:19.154
<v Speaker 3>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is they were saying crony capitalism is </v>

493
00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:21.434
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore the government should pick </v>

494
00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:25.040
<v Speaker 3>more companies to help or it should </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalized companies outright,</v>

495
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.450
<v Speaker 3>which is not the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

496
00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:29.120
<v Speaker 3>If you used a crony capitalism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism is bad.</v>

497
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.343
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the term crony capitalism </v>

498
00:20:31.251 --> 00:20:33.050
<v Speaker 3>because it's not capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's corporatism,</v>

499
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism is not being.</v>

500
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.923
<v Speaker 3>Being a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person who operates in business does </v>

501
00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:41.450
<v Speaker 3>not make you a capitalist business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People take loans and subsidies from the</v>

502
00:20:41.451 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 3>government all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

503
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Capitalist thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

504
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.721
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

505
00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:45.554
<v Speaker 3>it's a self interested thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but self interest in capitalism are not </v>

506
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 3>identical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

507
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to actually fight crony </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism,</v>

508
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.720
<v Speaker 3>then cut off the tie between government </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the private sector completely.</v>

509
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Which I would certainly prefer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of the Republican Party</v>

510
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:00.124
<v Speaker 3>that I dislike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a certainly corporate </v>

511
00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:02.304
<v Speaker 3>trust side of the establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican Party that is very much in </v>

512
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:06.424
<v Speaker 3>favor of government involvement in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy and I don't like that in the </v>

513
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:09.724
<v Speaker 3>slightest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not Bernie's real critique </v>

514
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if could,</v>

515
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 3>because if it were a full of free market</v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

516
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:16.330
<v Speaker 3>if the government weren't reaching out </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people,</v>

517
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:17.164
<v Speaker 3>and by the way the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to argue against crony </v>

518
00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:20.494
<v Speaker 3>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also have to argue against </v>

519
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 3>government subsidized loans for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who can't afford them for houses,</v>

520
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which causes massive economic crashes,</v>

521
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.950
<v Speaker 3>which Bernie apparently doesn't oppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Redman.</v>

522
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.823
<v Speaker 3>He would like more of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would like all of us to subsidize </v>

523
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that folks,</v>

524
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:36.790
<v Speaker 3>bad credit taking out loans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you actually,</v>

525
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.653
<v Speaker 3>if you got rid of all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you got rid of government </v>

526
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:39.694
<v Speaker 3>involvement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders would still think that </v>

527
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 3>something was wrong.</v>

528
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.490
<v Speaker 3>If Bill Gates is earning a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>and somebody the bottom is earning none,</v>

529
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:46.643
<v Speaker 3>he see somebody in a room with $5 in </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody with one and he immediately </v>

530
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:51.790
<v Speaker 3>says the guy with $5 must've stolen </v>
<v Speaker 3>something from the guy with $1.</v>

531
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.863
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no evidence of that until you </v>

532
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:55.324
<v Speaker 3>show me that evidence may be the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>with $5 produced more than the guy with </v>

533
00:21:57.551 --> 00:21:58.384
<v Speaker 3>$1.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll follow you up that line of </v>

534
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:02.440
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then we're,</v>

535
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.323
<v Speaker 3>where do we get to a point where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like to me at some level there </v>

536
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.970
<v Speaker 3>should be some sort of progressive tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be necessarily.</v>

537
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they talked about the one percent,</v>

538
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.130
<v Speaker 3>the studies were sort of all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

539
00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:14.140
<v Speaker 3>but it sounds like if you were in about </v>
<v Speaker 3>400 grand a year,</v>

540
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 3>you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the one percent.</v>

541
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in the one percent I am.</v>

542
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.000
<v Speaker 3>You're in the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

543
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:18.881
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well good.</v>

544
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:20.580
<v Speaker 3>I bet it took me a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got some money.</v>

545
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:21.733
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm in the one percent </v>

546
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.960
<v Speaker 3>present that had to take care of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

547
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 3>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So either way I'm proud of that fact.</v>

548
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:28.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

549
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.673
<v Speaker 3>Act like everybody asks ashamed about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much money they earn in this </v>

550
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:32.044
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the only thing that's </v>

551
00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:33.274
<v Speaker 3>charming about Donald Trump is that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that you should be proud of how </v>

552
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 3>much money you earned in this country </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you worked to get there,</v>

553
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:39.484
<v Speaker 3>I mean I spent a lot of money to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>law school and then I spent a lot of </v>

554
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:43.294
<v Speaker 3>times slogging in the trenches and now I</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a really good living and I work a </v>

555
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:47.650
<v Speaker 3>lot of hours to make that really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>living and my wife,</v>

556
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had to pay her entire medical </v>

557
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:49.954
<v Speaker 3>education out of pocket and she's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a doctor and she's going to make a </v>

558
00:22:51.401 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 3>really good living.</v>

559
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Good for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for me.</v>

560
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:54.483
<v Speaker 3>Good for good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For anybody who earns a living in this </v>

561
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:56.440
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

562
00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing,</v>

563
00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.520
<v Speaker 3>but as far as the progressive tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

564
00:22:59.521 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I think the progressive tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of crap.</v>

565
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I think I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about at some point,</v>

566
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:07.090
<v Speaker 3>so you get to $10,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year that it could be progressively,</v>

567
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just don't believe in that.</v>

568
00:23:09.581 --> 00:23:10.414
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't see why you deserve a </v>

569
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:13.630
<v Speaker 3>bigger percentage of my money because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>make more money.</v>

570
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:19.210
<v Speaker 3>The all taxes are is a is a gangster </v>
<v Speaker 3>shakedown and so when,</v>

571
00:23:19.701 --> 00:23:20.534
<v Speaker 3>when and that's all they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we can all agree that some </v>

572
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:24.850
<v Speaker 3>gangster shakedowns are worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we have to pay for police,</v>

573
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.320
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that here's the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with any sort of progressive tax.</v>

574
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.303
<v Speaker 3>There are three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just the general problem </v>

575
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 3>with progressive taxation.</v>

576
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 3>You have three people in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two of them are not bill gates in.</v>

577
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:38.650
<v Speaker 3>One of them is they vote two to one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they should take half of Bill Gates</v>

578
00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

579
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 3>This is a simplified version of American</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

580
00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my basic rule for all legislation</v>

581
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 3>and all taxation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you pass this law,</v>

582
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.423
<v Speaker 3>are you willing to shoot the person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>disobeys because that's what the </v>

583
00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:52.844
<v Speaker 3>government is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government is just a big shooting </v>

584
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 3>people machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

585
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 3>That's what the government does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The install in,</v>

586
00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:59.510
<v Speaker 3>whether you're talking national defense </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the police,</v>

587
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 3>there's certain laws or you pass them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say,</v>

588
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:05.300
<v Speaker 3>if you just obey this law and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>resist me with a gun,</v>

589
00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:06.134
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what laws are you willing to shoot </v>

590
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:08.684
<v Speaker 3>somebody over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This seems to be a pretty good measure </v>

591
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:11.510
<v Speaker 3>of am I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

592
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:13.100
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for taxation.</v>

593
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>

594
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 3>are you willing to shoot people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't pay taxes?</v>

595
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:18.710
<v Speaker 3>If those taxes go for the national </v>
<v Speaker 3>defense,</v>

596
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:20.960
<v Speaker 3>the Ta that protects us all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The answer is yes.</v>

597
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:21.794
<v Speaker 3>Because if nobody pays that tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then presumably everybody dies in some </v>

598
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:26.900
<v Speaker 3>sort of terrorist attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're going to ask me,</v>

599
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you willing to pay a progressive tax</v>

600
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 3>for whatever stupid government bowl </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pushing today?</v>

601
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 3>And am I willing to shoot somebody over </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

602
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.453
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the purpose of the tax is just </v>

603
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.320
<v Speaker 3>as important as the percentage.</v>

604
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.233
<v Speaker 1>So is that really the problem that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no idea at this point where our </v>

605
00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:40.470
<v Speaker 1>money goes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

606
00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:42.570
<v Speaker 1>We just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even now I'm hearing,</v>

607
00:24:42.571 --> 00:24:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie will say I'm ready.</v>

608
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.693
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked to that guy at the town hall </v>

609
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.610
<v Speaker 1>and the Guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I earned $41,000</v>

610
00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:50.160
<v Speaker 1>a year in Bernie admitted your taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>will go up,</v>

611
00:24:50.161 --> 00:24:51.230
<v Speaker 1>and then he explains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

612
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.750
<v Speaker 1>the health costs are going to go down or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

613
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.770
<v Speaker 1>That may or may not make no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

614
00:24:55.771 --> 00:24:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tax you $5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get $10,000</v>

615
00:24:58.231 --> 00:25:00.030
<v Speaker 1>back in medical service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What magic,</v>

616
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.580
<v Speaker 1>what magical box did you make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and is there.</v>

617
00:25:02.581 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Are there doctors in the back room </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

618
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.120
<v Speaker 1>When he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

619
00:25:06.121 --> 00:25:07.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're healthy,</v>

620
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.283
<v Speaker 1>if the government that say I wish left </v>
<v Speaker 1>to solutions work because they're the </v>

621
00:25:10.861 --> 00:25:12.240
<v Speaker 1>easiest solutions in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

622
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.073
<v Speaker 1>It's a recession tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody at 100 percent redistribute </v>

623
00:25:14.641 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 1>the wealth in tomb days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The recessions over there,</v>

624
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.440
<v Speaker 1>they're crap by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also a moral,</v>

625
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

626
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.320
<v Speaker 1>the left talks about these things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's moral,</v>

627
00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:23.154
<v Speaker 1>it's not moral to steal other people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth just because you're poorer than </v>

628
00:25:25.561 --> 00:25:26.400
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

629
00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:29.790
<v Speaker 1>so let's dive in to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as I told you before we started and I</v>

630
00:25:29.791 --> 00:25:32.310
<v Speaker 1>hinted at here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I came from the progressive world.</v>

631
00:25:32.311 --> 00:25:33.144
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now view being progressive basically </v>

632
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:38.220
<v Speaker 1>as a mental disorder or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I consider myself classic liberal,</v>

633
00:25:38.221 --> 00:25:39.054
<v Speaker 1>which really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is conservative in a lot of </v>

634
00:25:40.921 --> 00:25:42.930
<v Speaker 1>respects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's libertarian essentially.</v>

635
00:25:42.931 --> 00:25:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's technically defined.</v>

636
00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:46.950
<v Speaker 1>It's conservative or libertarian as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in there.</v>

637
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that the Republicans,</v>

638
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>if they would stick with what are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be there principles that you</v>

639
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:54.584
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have a much better argument </v>

640
00:25:56.401 --> 00:25:57.234
<v Speaker 1>than what they have right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that they don't stick to their </v>

641
00:25:59.371 --> 00:26:01.230
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>

642
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what's happened is</v>

643
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.953
<v Speaker 3>government has gotten larger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns into this giant grab bag of </v>

644
00:26:05.551 --> 00:26:06.384
<v Speaker 3>cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what you have is a bunch of </v>

645
00:26:07.111 --> 00:26:10.380
<v Speaker 3>constituencies in the United States who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are dependent on these.</v>

646
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Grab bags of cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was,</v>

647
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 3>I was down in Palm Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida for a,</v>

648
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.810
<v Speaker 3>for conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>must've been five years ago.</v>

649
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:16.913
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Linda lingle who was then running </v>

650
00:26:17.851 --> 00:26:19.210
<v Speaker 3>for Senate in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

651
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.270
<v Speaker 3>was former governor of why Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was,</v>

652
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.133
<v Speaker 3>she was speaking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a synagogue and I was there and this </v>

653
00:26:24.121 --> 00:26:25.110
<v Speaker 3>little old lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Palm Beach,</v>

654
00:26:25.111 --> 00:26:25.944
<v Speaker 3>a very rich area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little old lady titles up to her </v>

655
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Pearl Necklace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diamond earrings,</v>

656
00:26:29.881 --> 00:26:30.714
<v Speaker 3>and she walks up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will you do to keep them from </v>

657
00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:36.240
<v Speaker 3>cutting my social security?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought to myself,</v>

658
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:37.703
<v Speaker 3>who are you like you paid $50 into </v>
<v Speaker 3>social security when you were 35 and </v>

659
00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:42.390
<v Speaker 3>you're probably getting out $3,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a month now.</v>

660
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.730
<v Speaker 3>But because people have been made that </v>
<v Speaker 3>promise,</v>

661
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:47.100
<v Speaker 3>they're now dependent on the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do Republicans do?</v>

662
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.041
<v Speaker 3>Republicans say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

663
00:26:48.041 --> 00:26:48.811
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

664
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 3>I would never do away with social </v>
<v Speaker 3>security,</v>

665
00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:51.534
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would transition it or we would save </v>

666
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:53.364
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get into the business of the </v>

667
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:55.920
<v Speaker 3>government takes care of you and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>old age.</v>

668
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Now we're just arguing over methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not arguing over morality.</v>

669
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 3>My view is that people have been made </v>
<v Speaker 3>promises.</v>

670
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.053
<v Speaker 3>We have to keep those promises because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise we just have too many people </v>

671
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 3>who have no source of income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make a promise,</v>

672
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:10.560
<v Speaker 3>you keep a promise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you are under a particular age,</v>

673
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 3>no social security at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take.</v>

674
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I want my money back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

675
00:27:13.561 --> 00:27:14.394
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting 15 percent of my salary </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken every year to be put in a fund </v>

676
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:19.130
<v Speaker 3>that I will never see again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

677
00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:19.983
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one child and I have another one </v>

678
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:23.640
<v Speaker 3>on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would much prefer to put that in a Sep</v>

679
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Ira and just let that grow with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stock market.</v>

680
00:27:25.681 --> 00:27:26.710
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want stock market,</v>

681
00:27:26.711 --> 00:27:27.544
<v Speaker 3>the boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take all the money out of social </v>

682
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 3>security and put it into companies on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stock market.</v>

683
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 3>You want to see an actual economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>growth curve that would do it as opposed</v>

684
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:34.104
<v Speaker 3>to pretending that it's in a lock box </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere that doesn't exist when </v>

685
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:37.820
<v Speaker 3>they're just rating it every two days </v>
<v Speaker 3>for</v>

686
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.380
<v Speaker 1>the lockbox never existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

687
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Gore said he had the lockbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nobody.</v>

688
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 1>There was no lock box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

689
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a Ponzi scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

690
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.540
<v Speaker 1>so to the left though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm with you,</v>

691
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not.</v>

692
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.730
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of just not holding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their principles.</v>

693
00:27:49.731 --> 00:27:50.564
<v Speaker 1>So what I've seen in the left is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people went from being liberal and </v>

694
00:27:54.291 --> 00:27:55.124
<v Speaker 1>then somehow over the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years they've become these social </v>

695
00:27:58.581 --> 00:28:02.660
<v Speaker 1>justice warriors and they've divided </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody by what all our differences,</v>

696
00:28:02.661 --> 00:28:04.040
<v Speaker 1>our skin color and religion and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

697
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.023
<v Speaker 1>and they've picked a pecking order of </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the most aggrieved and that the </v>

698
00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:10.370
<v Speaker 1>victim is hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the victim hierarchy.</v>

699
00:28:10.371 --> 00:28:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

700
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no end to it,</v>

701
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.130
<v Speaker 1>that that's what scares me the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the ideology is there simply is no</v>

702
00:28:19.131 --> 00:28:19.964
<v Speaker 1>end game with it because ultimately it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to eat itself because then one day </v>

703
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.493
<v Speaker 1>you'll fight for everybody else and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come around and they'll come </v>

704
00:28:26.241 --> 00:28:26.560
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

705
00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what's happening on college campuses.</v>

706
00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.670
<v Speaker 3>College campuses are about as left as </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible to be,</v>

707
00:28:30.671 --> 00:28:33.010
<v Speaker 3>except that the leftists are now eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own right.</v>

708
00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:34.570
<v Speaker 3>They're going to the administrators and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

709
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.613
<v Speaker 3>you're all microaggressing us and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need trigger warnings and it's white </v>

710
00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:38.734
<v Speaker 3>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're ousting people who who were </v>

711
00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:43.480
<v Speaker 3>protesting in these buildings 40 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago on the left,</v>

712
00:28:43.481 --> 00:28:44.800
<v Speaker 3>and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're getting them fired now.</v>

713
00:28:44.801 --> 00:28:46.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry Lawrence Summers was,</v>

714
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.193
<v Speaker 3>was Clinton Secretary of the treasury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at Harvard when they throw them </v>

715
00:28:49.571 --> 00:28:50.380
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

716
00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.980
<v Speaker 3>and they throw him out because he made </v>
<v Speaker 3>the politically incorrect statement that</v>

717
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.993
<v Speaker 3>maybe there weren't that many women in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the high reaches of science because </v>

718
00:28:56.681 --> 00:28:57.514
<v Speaker 3>women didn't want to be in the higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaches of science or it's possible </v>

719
00:28:59.441 --> 00:29:00.274
<v Speaker 3>there weren't enough women who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>qualified for that and they throw him </v>

720
00:29:01.931 --> 00:29:02.660
<v Speaker 3>out for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

721
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.190
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

722
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.023
<v Speaker 3>What's happened I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we've reached a point where the </v>

723
00:29:06.791 --> 00:29:08.590
<v Speaker 3>wealthiest society in the history of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

724
00:29:08.591 --> 00:29:11.650
<v Speaker 3>the people here are the wealthiest that </v>
<v Speaker 3>any people have ever been,</v>

725
00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:12.843
<v Speaker 3>and we've also forgotten that there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's any sort of ideological </v>

726
00:29:17.261 --> 00:29:18.094
<v Speaker 3>existential threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was four when the Soviet Union </v>

727
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.673
<v Speaker 3>collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people my age and younger don't </v>

728
00:29:22.481 --> 00:29:23.920
<v Speaker 3>remember the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

729
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.773
<v Speaker 3>They don't recall it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not important to their lives and </v>

730
00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:27.664
<v Speaker 3>when they think of socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think of kind of the happy dappy </v>

731
00:29:29.141 --> 00:29:31.840
<v Speaker 3>socialism of Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never look at the tax rates,</v>

732
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.561
<v Speaker 3>but they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

733
00:29:32.561 --> 00:29:34.120
<v Speaker 3>everything is going okay in Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They forget,</v>

734
00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.330
<v Speaker 3>forget the fact that we've paid for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Denmark's national security for the last</v>

735
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.163
<v Speaker 3>half century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget the fact that they're now having </v>

736
00:29:38.621 --> 00:29:39.454
<v Speaker 3>to cut their taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget the fact they just elected a </v>

737
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.400
<v Speaker 3>government to keep out the Islamic wave </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's now swamping and all those things</v>

738
00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 3>go by the wayside.</v>

739
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.043
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is that all these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of live off the fat of the land we </v>

740
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:50.044
<v Speaker 3>all do and then rip away at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundations because when you're living </v>

741
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 3>in such a rich society and you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

742
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:57.244
<v Speaker 3>income inequality and you said there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people who are earning millions of </v>

743
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.573
<v Speaker 3>dollars and there are some people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are earning tens of thousands of </v>

744
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.063
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we forget is that in human history </v>

745
00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 3>and in human society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference there,</v>

746
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:07.534
<v Speaker 3>there's literally millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tens and tens of thousands of </v>

747
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.010
<v Speaker 3>dollars and then there's where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been historically which is here,</v>

748
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you rip away the foundation's,</v>

749
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:15.214
<v Speaker 3>everybody's going to end up down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just take all of the founding </v>

750
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 3>principles of small government and free </v>
<v Speaker 3>markets and rip them away.</v>

751
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:21.543
<v Speaker 3>But what's happened is when young people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are always looking for a reason to </v>

752
00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:25.081
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

753
00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:26.230
<v Speaker 3>we want to change the world.</v>

754
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.520
<v Speaker 3>That's our thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Changing the world.</v>

755
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.200
<v Speaker 3>One of the world's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you change?</v>

756
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.433
<v Speaker 3>We've basically changed a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>external circumstances and now the </v>

757
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:34.930
<v Speaker 3>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're rich.</v>

758
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 3>You live a pretty free life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

759
00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 3>So what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only what I feel is wrong,</v>

760
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:40.683
<v Speaker 3>what's in here is what's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's become very feelings based </v>

761
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:43.834
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that said to me that hurts my </v>

762
00:30:44.831 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 3>feelings is now no longer just something</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurtful.</v>

763
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a microaggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

764
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 3>And I can actually reach out and I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>harm you.</v>

765
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can ban you.</v>

766
00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I can call the police if you hurt my </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings at University of Missouri.</v>

767
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.130
<v Speaker 3>There was actually when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when this whole thing was going down,</v>

768
00:30:57.131 --> 00:30:57.964
<v Speaker 3>there was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the University of Missouri Police </v>

769
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Department put out a notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody says something to you that's</v>

770
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:03.280
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call the police department,</v>

771
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy percent.</v>

772
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:05.403
<v Speaker 3>There was a poll that just came out that</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 percent of college students are </v>

773
00:31:07.961 --> 00:31:10.210
<v Speaker 3>comfortable with hate speech codes on </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus.</v>

774
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Forty percent of college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>student of millennials,</v>

775
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:13.744
<v Speaker 3>people aged 18 to 34,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 percent of them believe that speech </v>

776
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:17.434
<v Speaker 3>that's offensive to women or minorities </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be banned in the United States </v>

777
00:31:22.011 --> 00:31:22.780
<v Speaker 3>across.</v>

778
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.090
<v Speaker 1>So some of this though that young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just kind of dumb,</v>

779
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.933
<v Speaker 1>like the world is going to teach you </v>
<v Speaker 1>some stuff and when you're at college </v>

780
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be kind of dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guest on a couple of weeks ago,</v>

781
00:31:30.991 --> 00:31:31.824
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who said that they're all this </v>

782
00:31:33.211 --> 00:31:35.090
<v Speaker 1>microaggression stuff and all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech,</v>

783
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.410
<v Speaker 1>as horrible as it sounds to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

784
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.320
<v Speaker 1>He sort of was arguing that in a way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>

785
00:31:40.321 --> 00:31:43.830
<v Speaker 1>this shows the progress because instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of having to fight for actual things,</v>

786
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.770
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting for these feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that he was for.</v>

787
00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:47.604
<v Speaker 1>That shows you that we've progressed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know that black people aren't </v>

788
00:31:50.911 --> 00:31:53.340
<v Speaker 1>fighting so that they have separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>water fountains.</v>

789
00:31:53.341 --> 00:31:55.380
<v Speaker 1>They are now fighting over things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>may,</v>

790
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.300
<v Speaker 1>that are just about feelings and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously</v>

791
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.280
<v Speaker 3>awesome and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's testament to the progress,</v>

792
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:01.470
<v Speaker 3>but I mean ted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to golf,</v>

793
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 3>what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 years ago,</v>

794
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:03.694
<v Speaker 3>black people were fighting to not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate water fountains and today </v>

795
00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:07.630
<v Speaker 3>they're fighting to have separate water </v>
<v Speaker 3>fountains,</v>

796
00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:08.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they actually want separate black</v>

797
00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:09.724
<v Speaker 3>housing at USC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually wanted a separate black </v>

798
00:32:12.011 --> 00:32:12.844
<v Speaker 3>safe space at University of Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is dangerous stuff and what's more </v>

799
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:18.130
<v Speaker 3>dangerous is an entire political </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

800
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:18.964
<v Speaker 3>The benefits from this because now </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got candidates who benefit by </v>

801
00:32:21.911 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Speaker 3>telling particular interest groups and </v>
<v Speaker 3>racial groups.</v>

802
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 3>You're a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to help you out.</v>

803
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.243
<v Speaker 3>The way we are going to help you out is </v>
<v Speaker 3>by specifically calling the rest of the </v>

804
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:30.544
<v Speaker 3>society racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a victim forever and the longer </v>

805
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:33.700
<v Speaker 3>we can make you feel like you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim,</v>

806
00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.070
<v Speaker 3>the more you're dependent on us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

807
00:32:36.071 --> 00:32:36.331
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

808
00:32:36.331 --> 00:32:37.121
<v Speaker 3>We'll just go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

809
00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton was doing this in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harlem the other day.</v>

810
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:40.574
<v Speaker 3>She was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

811
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.443
<v Speaker 3>we haven't cured racism in the country </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I'm going to take </v>

812
00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:43.994
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of dollars poured </v>
<v Speaker 3>into Harlem is though nobody's poured </v>

813
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:46.874
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of dollars into </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harlem before the only dollars into </v>

814
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:49.784
<v Speaker 3>Harlem that are actually going to matter</v>
<v Speaker 3>are police dollars to clean up high </v>

815
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:53.234
<v Speaker 3>crime areas so that investors will go in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason that businesses aren't </v>

816
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:55.934
<v Speaker 3>going into high crime areas is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're high crime areas and just </v>

817
00:32:58.431 --> 00:32:59.380
<v Speaker 3>dumping money in there and get help.</v>

818
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:00.643
<v Speaker 1>So you would agree that racism exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are people that are </v>

819
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:05.324
<v Speaker 1>legitimate reasons.</v>

820
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.173
<v Speaker 3>It would be idiotic to think otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course there are legitimate racist </v>

821
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:09.464
<v Speaker 3>and we should target them and we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>find them and we should hurt their </v>

822
00:33:11.061 --> 00:33:15.590
<v Speaker 3>careers because racism is unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I don't agree with is this.</v>

823
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't like fighting phantoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said earlier.</v>

824
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Institutional racism is a meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 3>phrase.</v>

825
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Libraries are not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Schools are not racist.</v>

826
00:33:22.851 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 3>You have to show me a law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a policy,</v>

827
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.903
<v Speaker 3>a person who is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just say American society is </v>

828
00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:29.420
<v Speaker 3>racist because that doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

829
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:30.523
<v Speaker 3>Show me the actual problem that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss because when you just throw </v>

830
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:35.660
<v Speaker 3>tautologies out there like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I supposed to do?</v>

831
00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:38.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no way to fight that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's legitimately no way to fight it.</v>

832
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.143
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I discussed that with Larry elder </v>

833
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:41.980
<v Speaker 1>who's conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the,</v>

834
00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:42.883
<v Speaker 1>on the libertarian side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he basically said what you just </v>

835
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:45.794
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think some of my progressive </v>

836
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 1>friends would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

837
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 1>it may not be institutional anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are laws that existed,</v>

838
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 1>no longer exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would say,</v>

839
00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:53.894
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain communities will get less </v>

840
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:57.494
<v Speaker 1>because of racism just because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of racism will get less qualified </v>

841
00:34:00.531 --> 00:34:01.364
<v Speaker 1>people to teach and that they will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated differently by the police and </v>

842
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:04.280
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

843
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by by income level,</v>

844
00:34:05.571 --> 00:34:06.500
<v Speaker 3>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>

845
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:09.350
<v Speaker 3>By income level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a race and income level tend to</v>

846
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 3>correlate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>

847
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

848
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:13.520
<v Speaker 3>that's more to do with income level than</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with race.</v>

849
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:14.354
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's somebody sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Sacramento today in California </v>

850
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.590
<v Speaker 3>growing up black community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not putting anybody in there.</v>

851
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean the real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real gap in the country,</v>

852
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 3>especially between rich and poor is two </v>
<v Speaker 3>parent households,</v>

853
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:25.064
<v Speaker 3>not race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the poverty rate in the black </v>

854
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 3>community for two parent households is </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven percent.</v>

855
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.600
<v Speaker 3>The poverty rate in the white community </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

856
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.720
<v Speaker 3>for a single parent household is 22 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

857
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.633
<v Speaker 1>So Larry said that to middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that same thing and he got a lot of </v>

858
00:34:35.831 --> 00:34:38.290
<v Speaker 1>hate for it and then I got lumped into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the because people.</v>

859
00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.320
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just go with you on that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the purposes just so I'll trust that</v>

860
00:34:43.511 --> 00:34:45.550
<v Speaker 1>you're giving me a fair statistics </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>

861
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.760
<v Speaker 1>So fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

862
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.633
<v Speaker 1>that enrages people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that concept I </v>

863
00:34:51.041 --> 00:34:51.874
<v Speaker 1>think that really upsets people and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say that that's really because of </v>

864
00:34:54.251 --> 00:34:54.930
<v Speaker 1>the feeling.</v>

865
00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

866
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.040
<v Speaker 3>this is my catchphrase goes facts don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>care about your feelings.</v>

867
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean there were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reality is,</v>

868
00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

869
00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:04.710
<v Speaker 3>This is as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we move forward and American society,</v>

870
00:35:04.711 --> 00:35:05.544
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that's going to cure the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ills that we have is looking at some of </v>

871
00:35:08.071 --> 00:35:10.350
<v Speaker 3>the real problems straight in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

872
00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:11.184
<v Speaker 3>the fact is that when welfare was </v>
<v Speaker 3>instituted in the sixties before it was </v>

873
00:35:14.131 --> 00:35:14.964
<v Speaker 3>instituted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black single motherhood rate was 20 </v>

874
00:35:16.171 --> 00:35:17.004
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is now in excess of 70 percent and </v>

875
00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:19.374
<v Speaker 3>it's not just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just impacting the black </v>

876
00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:21.690
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impacting the white community.</v>

877
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.713
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The white community used to have a five </v>

878
00:35:23.341 --> 00:35:25.680
<v Speaker 3>percent single motherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now it's in excess of 40 percent.</v>

879
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.870
<v Speaker 3>The fact is you are going to get higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime,</v>

880
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.140
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get more poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the Brookings Institute,</v>

881
00:35:31.141 --> 00:35:32.430
<v Speaker 3>which is a left institute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

882
00:35:32.431 --> 00:35:33.264
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a liberal institute at the </v>

883
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Brookings Institute and they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>straddle that line between liberal left.</v>

884
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 3>They say that if you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanently poor in the United States,</v>

885
00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Speaker 3>you need to do three things and three </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

886
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Only graduate high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a job in hold it.</v>

887
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Don't have a baby before you're married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

888
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:47.903
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things have nothing to do with </v>

889
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 3>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

890
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:52.480
<v Speaker 3>There's not a white person there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

891
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.833
<v Speaker 3>They're very fee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be hard pressed to find a black </v>

892
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 3>person in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost straw man yourself there,</v>

893
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:58.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

894
00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I'd be hard pressed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's one.</v>

895
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.863
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many single black </v>

896
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:04.464
<v Speaker 3>single mothers got pregnant because a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white man was holding a gun to a black </v>

897
00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 3>man's head and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to impregnate this person.</v>

898
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Then leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

899
00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:10.494
<v Speaker 3>Be Single.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherhood is a decision that's made by </v>

900
00:36:11.401 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 3>the people who are involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual act and what happens afterward.</v>

901
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's the single best predictor of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of gender,</v>

902
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 3>intergenerational poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So make good decisions.</v>

903
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.863
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is really the issue that when the </v>

904
00:36:22.011 --> 00:36:24.140
<v Speaker 1>left doesn't deal with these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

905
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.360
<v Speaker 1>that then they're just handing it to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

906
00:36:26.361 --> 00:36:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this,</v>

907
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.960
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about this a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to all this stuff with Islam,</v>

908
00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Islam that because the left calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone a racist.</v>

909
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:36.290
<v Speaker 1>So anytime me or any of my friends that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are talking about this,</v>

910
00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:39.050
<v Speaker 1>there's not many of us on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time we bring it up,</v>

911
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm getting called a big left and</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and now and yet they can't say,</v>

912
00:36:42.561 --> 00:36:43.394
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you point to something bigoted I've </v>

913
00:36:43.881 --> 00:36:46.240
<v Speaker 1>said or something racist and they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a feeling.</v>

914
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Feel offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel offended.</v>

915
00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.440
<v Speaker 1>But is this where if the left doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with something?</v>

916
00:36:51.441 --> 00:36:52.274
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about Islam is or if the </v>

917
00:36:53.091 --> 00:36:53.924
<v Speaker 1>deaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the left doesn't deal with the roots </v>

918
00:36:55.401 --> 00:36:56.234
<v Speaker 1>of income inequality as you've laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you just hand it to the far right </v>

919
00:36:59.001 --> 00:36:59.781
<v Speaker 1>ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

920
00:36:59.781 --> 00:37:00.614
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't this sort of explained trump to </v>

921
00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.143
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

922
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

923
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 3>to a certain extent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's right.</v>

924
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that what happens is that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

925
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.503
<v Speaker 3>in A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never justify people reacting </v>

926
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:13.890
<v Speaker 3>and racist fashion because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can react in a reasonable fashion to</v>

927
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.733
<v Speaker 3>stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say silly things like single </v>

928
00:37:16.531 --> 00:37:17.364
<v Speaker 3>motherhood doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I say no single motherhood </v>

929
00:37:18.661 --> 00:37:22.190
<v Speaker 3>absolutely does matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what people tend to what some,</v>

930
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.033
<v Speaker 3>a certain segment of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is true both on the left and </v>

931
00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:25.381
<v Speaker 3>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when they,</v>

932
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:26.214
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when somebody says something they don't </v>

933
00:37:26.821 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they immediately go to racism.</v>

934
00:37:28.951 --> 00:37:29.784
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you the number of tweets I </v>

935
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:31.644
<v Speaker 3>have received after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I said that I don't like Donald </v>

936
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.953
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when the antisemites come out of </v>

937
00:37:34.741 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Speaker 3>the woodwork and it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre to me.</v>

938
00:37:36.631 --> 00:37:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what is,</v>

939
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:40.820
<v Speaker 3>what is my Jewishness have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>not liking trump?</v>

940
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.500
<v Speaker 3>And as far as I'm aware of his daughters</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural convert to Judaism.</v>

941
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:44.260
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

942
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.120
<v Speaker 3>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

943
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.560
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

944
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:50.060
<v Speaker 3>and I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's polarizing the debate in a way that</v>

945
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:50.820
<v Speaker 3>need not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not,</v>

946
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.210
<v Speaker 3>we're not trying to solve problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore in American politics.</v>

947
00:37:53.211 --> 00:37:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to do is demonize the other</v>

948
00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:58.300
<v Speaker 3>side and turn them into the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my goal is to demonize the people</v>

949
00:37:58.301 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 3>who try to demonize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

950
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.000
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

951
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 3>those are the people who ought to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonized.</v>

952
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:02.334
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your goal in politics is to make </v>

953
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.760
<v Speaker 3>character attacks without regard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>

954
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:06.594
<v Speaker 3>then I'm not interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in debating you on on facts because </v>

955
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:10.900
<v Speaker 3>you're clearly not interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>debating on fact.</v>

956
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a.</v>

957
00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:12.483
<v Speaker 1>that's a good segue because I read your </v>
<v Speaker 1>11 rules for debating leftists and I </v>

958
00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:17.750
<v Speaker 1>just read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the entire thing this morning.</v>

959
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

960
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.173
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's on my mind and basically </v>

961
00:38:22.131 --> 00:38:22.964
<v Speaker 1>everything you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was struggling when I was reading </v>

962
00:38:24.411 --> 00:38:25.310
<v Speaker 1>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

963
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm agreeing with all of this because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>still consider myself liberal and there </v>

964
00:38:29.301 --> 00:38:30.134
<v Speaker 1>is a part of me that I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read something by a guy that's </v>

965
00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:34.400
<v Speaker 1>conservative and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with this stuff,</v>

966
00:38:34.401 --> 00:38:35.234
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of what I saw in there are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact tactics that I've seen this </v>

967
00:38:38.561 --> 00:38:43.561
<v Speaker 1>regressive left use on me and use on Sam</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris and all these other relentlessly.</v>

968
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>So you really gave the antidote to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things so you don't have to lay</v>

969
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:48.664
<v Speaker 1>out all 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to pick some highlights </v>

970
00:38:49.571 --> 00:38:50.430
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's some really.</v>

971
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of them kind of turn into,</v>

972
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:55.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm trying to remember all 11 off the</v>

973
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:57.350
<v Speaker 3>top of my head or at least give me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple.</v>

974
00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:58.260
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the.</v>

975
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 3>The first one is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>embrace the fight.</v>

976
00:39:00.011 --> 00:39:01.900
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand going in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a fight,</v>

977
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:02.883
<v Speaker 3>usually any you have to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>determine the purpose of the </v>

978
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:05.494
<v Speaker 3>conversation that you're having is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>base and this is true if you're left or </v>

979
00:39:07.751 --> 00:39:09.820
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually determine what your goal is.</v>

980
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Is your goal to convince the person on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side,</v>

981
00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 3>is the person open to being convinced?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If not,</v>

982
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:15.124
<v Speaker 3>you're wasting your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you on a show and there's an </v>

983
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:19.120
<v Speaker 3>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case you're not speaking to the</v>

984
00:39:19.121 --> 00:39:22.120
<v Speaker 3>person you're speaking to the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once you determine that,</v>

985
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:24.490
<v Speaker 3>understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if there's hostility,</v>

986
00:39:24.491 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 3>you have to be ready to punch back twice</v>
<v Speaker 3>as hard.</v>

987
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to and be preemptive in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>

988
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.470
<v Speaker 1>which by the way you say that's a left </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

989
00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.650
<v Speaker 3>These are all left ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These punch back twice as hard.</v>

990
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.513
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was President Obama who coined the </v>

991
00:39:35.091 --> 00:39:35.730
<v Speaker 3>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

992
00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:36.563
<v Speaker 3>He was the one who was saying that his </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters Audit Punch back twice as </v>

993
00:39:38.481 --> 00:39:39.314
<v Speaker 3>hard and I've sort of hijack dad because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's actually an effective </v>

994
00:39:41.871 --> 00:39:42.704
<v Speaker 3>tactic and necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've also said that one of that is </v>

995
00:39:45.921 --> 00:39:46.754
<v Speaker 3>important at the very outset to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the framing of questions is proper </v>

996
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.553
<v Speaker 3>because one of the ways that the left is</v>
<v Speaker 3>succeeds and you see it in the </v>

997
00:39:53.511 --> 00:39:54.344
<v Speaker 3>Republican debates particularly is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll ask a question and then the </v>

998
00:39:57.021 --> 00:39:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Republicans won't even bother to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>reframing what the question is.</v>

999
00:39:59.991 --> 00:40:02.540
<v Speaker 3>So John Dickerson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other night and in the CBS debate,</v>

1000
00:40:02.541 --> 00:40:05.540
<v Speaker 3>he opens up with any tries to brow beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ted Cruz on.</v>

1001
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.113
<v Speaker 3>You say that nobody should be confirmed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last year of a presidents have a </v>

1002
00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:13.070
<v Speaker 3>presidents run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it true that the constitution says</v>

1003
00:40:13.071 --> 00:40:16.220
<v Speaker 3>the president gets to pick the nominee </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Cruz instead of just saying,</v>

1004
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.740
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about the timeline.</v>

1005
00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.573
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to confirm anybody who </v>

1006
00:40:21.021 --> 00:40:22.450
<v Speaker 3>doesn't agree with Scalia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1007
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Instead of just saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not our obligation to do that,</v>

1008
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:26.780
<v Speaker 3>the constitution has many provisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>

1009
00:40:26.781 --> 00:40:28.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of just reframing the question,</v>

1010
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.270
<v Speaker 3>he sort of bought into it and you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that from a lot of these,</v>

1011
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.283
<v Speaker 3>from a lot of Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just accept the question as it </v>

1012
00:40:34.671 --> 00:40:36.490
<v Speaker 3>comes to them rather than thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1013
00:40:36.491 --> 00:40:37.324
<v Speaker 3>there's a second question that's usually</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of embedded in the first question </v>

1014
00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.310
<v Speaker 3>that's being asked in most in most </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate.</v>

1015
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.470
<v Speaker 3>So those are a couple examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also,</v>

1016
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:46.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to accept the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1017
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.843
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to accept the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hero worship the that so many </v>

1018
00:40:50.331 --> 00:40:51.164
<v Speaker 3>Republicans do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the frequent ones that you do is </v>

1019
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:53.810
<v Speaker 3>somebody will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1020
00:40:53.811 --> 00:40:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Ronald Reagan was for amnesty.</v>

1021
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Why do I care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1022
00:40:57.051 --> 00:40:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I was too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

1023
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.063
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you did amnesty and what it will </v>

1024
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.270
<v Speaker 3>look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to talk about regular or limb.</v>

1025
00:41:02.271 --> 00:41:04.220
<v Speaker 3>When people try to misdirect to Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1026
00:41:04.221 --> 00:41:05.054
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you were saying something about </v>

1027
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they say something about Bush.</v>

1028
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:10.710
<v Speaker 3>So a proper answer should be FDR,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woodrow Wilson,</v>

1029
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:11.563
<v Speaker 3>William Howard Taft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1030
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.920
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk about Bush,</v>

1031
00:41:12.921 --> 00:41:15.170
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk about Bush Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk about Obama,</v>

1032
00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.213
<v Speaker 3>like let's stick to the topic at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of my basic rules for debate </v>

1033
00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.340
<v Speaker 3>can basically be boiled down to two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1034
00:41:22.341 --> 00:41:27.110
<v Speaker 3>which is get the character assassination</v>
<v Speaker 3>off the table if they were going to call</v>

1035
00:41:27.111 --> 00:41:27.891
<v Speaker 3>you a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

1036
00:41:27.891 --> 00:41:28.521
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobe.</v>

1037
00:41:28.521 --> 00:41:30.410
<v Speaker 3>The proper response is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1038
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:31.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

1039
00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:32.031
<v Speaker 3>bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobe.</v>

1040
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Here's all the proof that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no,</v>

1041
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:34.694
<v Speaker 3>you're a jackass because you have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>proof of calling me that and accusing </v>

1042
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 3>people of things without evidence is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mark of being a jackass.</v>

1043
00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's that.</v>

1044
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 3>That is the proper response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once that's all off the table,</v>

1045
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.250
<v Speaker 3>then we can actually have a policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

1046
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.570
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do about people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't stop doing that?</v>

1047
00:41:48.571 --> 00:41:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some leave and I just let it be.</v>

1048
00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:51.803
<v Speaker 3>You leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you say this is not a worthwhile </v>

1049
00:41:52.561 --> 00:41:54.150
<v Speaker 3>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an asshole and I'm leaving.</v>

1050
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.041
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

1051
00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:57.340
<v Speaker 3>there's no purpose to it.</v>

1052
00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:58.813
<v Speaker 1>Think not picking up the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this would be whether you're on the </v>

1053
00:42:00.631 --> 00:42:01.470
<v Speaker 1>left or the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1054
00:42:01.471 --> 00:42:04.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever fight you're in that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>by not picking up the fight,</v>

1055
00:42:04.831 --> 00:42:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you actually are strengthening them.</v>

1056
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.031
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1057
00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:08.280
<v Speaker 3>because I think you're strengthening </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1058
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Here's the logic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1059
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.360
<v Speaker 3>If somebody calls me a racist and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1060
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:11.631
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1061
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:12.464
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me explain to you why I'm not a </v>

1062
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:15.020
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You what you're really saying,</v>

1063
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 3>what you're really saying is you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrational fellow.</v>

1064
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.913
<v Speaker 3>Let's have a conversation about why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not a racist by even granting the </v>

1065
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 3>predicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your rational fellow,</v>

1066
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 3>he just called you a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1067
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:27.110
<v Speaker 3>If you say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a racist,</v>

1068
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.951
<v Speaker 3>and then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1069
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:28.790
<v Speaker 3>you're a rational thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1070
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1071
00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:30.494
<v Speaker 3>I'm a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're rational fellow calling me a </v>

1072
00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:32.114
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A rational person could theoretically </v>

1073
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:34.880
<v Speaker 3>think I'm a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1074
00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:36.350
<v Speaker 3>the answer is that's an irrational </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>

1075
00:42:36.351 --> 00:42:37.910
<v Speaker 3>You're being irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying is,</v>

1076
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:38.744
<v Speaker 3>is ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're a bad person for dropping </v>

1077
00:42:41.391 --> 00:42:43.880
<v Speaker 3>charges on me without evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only bad people do this,</v>

1078
00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to drop a charge,</v>

1079
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 3>make sure he can back it up.</v>

1080
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:47.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

1081
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:48.164
<v Speaker 1>I find that there's an incredible lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being able to back it up and there's </v>

1082
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:51.794
<v Speaker 1>a constant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that you address this </v>

1083
00:42:52.311 --> 00:42:53.144
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I find it a lot of these debates </v>

1084
00:42:54.561 --> 00:42:55.394
<v Speaker 1>when I had these debates with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a constant moving of the goal </v>

1085
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 1>post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you say something and you sort of get</v>

1086
00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:01.694
<v Speaker 1>the point across and they they can even </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't outwardly accept that it </v>

1087
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:05.294
<v Speaker 1>is being intellectually do and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just move what they say and then they </v>

1088
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:09.990
<v Speaker 1>just keep moving and moving it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1089
00:43:09.991 --> 00:43:10.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're back in Sir Circle.</v>

1090
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.443
<v Speaker 3>I do say in that pamphlet that arguing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people on the left is sort of like </v>

1091
00:43:14.871 --> 00:43:16.460
<v Speaker 3>trying to nail Jello to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The minute,</v>

1092
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:18.380
<v Speaker 3>the minute that you finished one </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

1093
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:19.214
<v Speaker 3>they're already onto the next and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're usually swiveling to places the </v>

1094
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 3>demo comfortable like same sex marriage </v>
<v Speaker 3>or social issues because that,</v>

1095
00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.413
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are,</v>

1096
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:26.940
<v Speaker 3>those are issues closer to the heart so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1097
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:28.610
<v Speaker 3>they're more comfortable for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>argue.</v>

1098
00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:29.843
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're arguing economics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>invariably you find yourself talking </v>

1099
00:43:32.211 --> 00:43:34.430
<v Speaker 3>about why Republicans are mean to gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>people or something.</v>

1100
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.180
<v Speaker 3>It's always a shifting goalposts because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get an if they.</v>

1101
00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:39.950
<v Speaker 3>If the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I like about sanders.</v>

1102
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.890
<v Speaker 3>I think sanders will actually give </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest answers to questions.</v>

1103
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:45.110
<v Speaker 3>If I say to Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie,</v>

1104
00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:48.200
<v Speaker 3>what constitutes income equality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forgetting income inequality?</v>

1105
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:50.420
<v Speaker 3>Like what gradation would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Income equality.</v>

1106
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Does everybody have to earn the same?</v>

1107
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Because there's a name for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1108
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean if everybody earns the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way to do that is to confiscate</v>

1109
00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 3>all wealth and redistribute it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's called Communism,</v>

1110
00:43:57.951 --> 00:43:59.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that sanders would,</v>

1111
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.510
<v Speaker 3>would actually answer that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people on the left won't.</v>

1112
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.790
<v Speaker 3>They'll just move the goal posts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what do you think you would actually</v>

1113
00:44:04.791 --> 00:44:05.820
<v Speaker 3>say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that would,</v>

1114
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.673
<v Speaker 3>he would probably say is you would say </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of income inequality that we </v>

1115
00:44:08.541 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 3>see in Europe is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1116
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.710
<v Speaker 3>is more beneficial to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the United States.</v>

1117
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:13.903
<v Speaker 3>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1118
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.400
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that requires a 60 percent tax rate.</v>

1119
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:17.234
<v Speaker 3>It means that the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally the prices of your car will </v>

1120
00:44:18.741 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 3>double because they have massive excise </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes over in Denmark and you know if,</v>

1121
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:26.420
<v Speaker 3>if that's something that you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also going to have to raise taxes</v>

1122
00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:28.340
<v Speaker 3>on the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised taxes on the middle class.</v>

1123
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.810
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to gauge the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that every in America is going to leave,</v>

1124
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 3>which is not going to be pleasant for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1125
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Are you willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you willing to build?</v>

1126
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing about Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his economic policy.</v>

1127
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump wants to build a wall to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep people out.</v>

1128
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.183
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders will have to build a wall</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep businesses in because they will </v>

1129
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:44.274
<v Speaker 3>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually have to chain them to a </v>

1130
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:47.430
<v Speaker 3>stake in order to keep them here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1131
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:50.160
<v Speaker 3>so we've talked about a lot of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we sort of agree on.</v>

1132
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 3>I haven't agreed with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm letting you talk.</v>

1133
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 3>People always yell at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

1134
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:54.620
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't yell back at your,</v>

1135
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:55.280
<v Speaker 3>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>

1136
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>

1137
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.680
<v Speaker 3>let's get into some other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the gay marriage,</v>

1138
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.500
<v Speaker 3>let's talk to a marriage or you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>big on gay marriage?</v>

1139
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not at a.</v>

1140
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.253
<v Speaker 3>not on a social level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the government ought to be </v>

1141
00:45:05.131 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 3>completely out of the business of </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>

1142
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.520
<v Speaker 3>I think the government sucks at </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is my.</v>

1143
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.413
<v Speaker 3>Is My short message for today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government is terrible at </v>

1144
00:45:10.861 --> 00:45:11.694
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the government's goal is to forward </v>

1145
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:15.510
<v Speaker 3>traditional marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>utterly failed obviously.</v>

1146
00:45:15.511 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 3>As you don't mind to being out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>business of traditional marriage at all.</v>

1147
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:20.243
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that.</v>

1148
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 3>I think the government should be out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all marriage.</v>

1149
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.440
<v Speaker 3>I think the government stinks at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1150
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 3>now I will say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I think that the.</v>

1151
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:27.324
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea of the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidizing gay marriage is silly </v>

1152
00:45:29.251 --> 00:45:31.380
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>societal benefit to gay marriage.</v>

1153
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:32.214
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to make the argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>that government should be involved in </v>

1154
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:34.434
<v Speaker 3>marriage at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just not even an argument with which I </v>

1155
00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 3>agree at this point the way it is right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1156
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Let's go from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1157
00:45:39.461 --> 00:45:42.390
<v Speaker 3>So before I get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one quick point.</v>

1158
00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:43.224
<v Speaker 3>The reason I want the government out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the business of marriage is because now </v>

1159
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 3>that the government has enshrined gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage,</v>

1160
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:47.783
<v Speaker 3>the next step is going to be going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious people and telling them they </v>

1161
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:53.730
<v Speaker 3>have to engage with same sex weddings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as a religious person,</v>

1162
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.713
<v Speaker 3>this is problematic to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a society in which I can do what </v>

1163
00:45:56.671 --> 00:45:57.504
<v Speaker 3>I want and I don't have to care what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think and you can do what you want and </v>

1164
00:45:59.041 --> 00:45:59.874
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to cover it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it doesn't mean you get to come </v>

1165
00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:01.764
<v Speaker 3>into my synagogue and get married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also doesn't mean that I have to go </v>

1166
00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:04.314
<v Speaker 3>to your gay wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting place to have the </v>

1167
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:09.990
<v Speaker 3>discussion because I would argue for gay</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage for the exact reasons.</v>

1168
00:46:09.991 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't want the government involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things.</v>

1169
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.193
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's exactly why gay marriage </v>

1170
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 3>should exist and I think it ran Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hit that point harder.</v>

1171
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.143
<v Speaker 3>It would have made a sensible </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian argument of limited </v>

1172
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:22.480
<v Speaker 3>government and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude?</v>

1173
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead and you want to smoke weed on </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and your bright.</v>

1174
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:25.063
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend to agree with both of those </v>

1175
00:46:25.591 --> 00:46:26.191
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with,</v>

1176
00:46:26.191 --> 00:46:27.600
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find people who smoke weed,</v>

1177
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.970
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably irritating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not my business.</v>

1178
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:30.933
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the beauty of America is you </v>

1179
00:46:31.771 --> 00:46:34.290
<v Speaker 3>don't have to give a crap what I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>we said this is what you end the show by</v>

1180
00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:35.460
<v Speaker 3>taking the bong hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1181
00:46:35.461 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Well that's going to be awkward then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1182
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:39.660
<v Speaker 3>but the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1183
00:46:39.661 --> 00:46:40.494
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as the secondary argument about </v>

1184
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:43.740
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take the predicate that government</v>

1185
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:44.574
<v Speaker 3>is now involved in marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should government subsidized gay </v>

1186
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:48.690
<v Speaker 3>marriage and straight marriage the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>

1187
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:49.823
<v Speaker 3>My answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the only purpose for the </v>

1188
00:46:51.181 --> 00:46:52.014
<v Speaker 3>government getting involved in marriage </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the procreation of the next </v>

1189
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:55.620
<v Speaker 3>generation and the raising of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

1190
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.770
<v Speaker 3>And it's my belief that a man and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman to a better job of raising a child</v>

1191
00:46:58.771 --> 00:46:59.604
<v Speaker 3>and producing children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously biologically than two men or </v>

1192
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:04.350
<v Speaker 3>two women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it isn't the child.</v>

1193
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Part of it is sort of secondary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1194
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:07.710
<v Speaker 3>there are plenty of people that get </v>
<v Speaker 3>married,</v>

1195
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.620
<v Speaker 3>gay couples and straight couples that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have kids.</v>

1196
00:47:09.621 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a siren in and of itself is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>just about,</v>

1197
00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:13.523
<v Speaker 3>but at a governmental level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about those people are </v>

1198
00:47:15.631 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 3>meaning like I care that I'm happy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're happy,</v>

1199
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:20.160
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care what they do.</v>

1200
00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Like it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

1201
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.373
<v Speaker 3>The government theoretically has an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest in the production of the next </v>

1202
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:25.740
<v Speaker 3>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1203
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 3>That's the only interest in marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in fact,</v>

1204
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 3>you could even make a case to government</v>
<v Speaker 3>ought to be giving,</v>

1205
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically tax benefits for,</v>

1206
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.270
<v Speaker 3>for having kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1207
00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:37.070
<v Speaker 3>and no benefit for marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1208
00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.051
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the truth is,</v>

1209
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:38.884
<v Speaker 3>the reason that this was created in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place obviously is because before </v>

1210
00:47:40.931 --> 00:47:41.764
<v Speaker 3>the advent of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1211
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.260
<v Speaker 3>long before the advent of modern birth </v>
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>

1212
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:47.740
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fair assumption was that if you were</v>

1213
00:47:47.741 --> 00:47:50.080
<v Speaker 3>having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you are going to get pregnant,</v>

1214
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.393
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least if you were having straight </v>

1215
00:47:51.821 --> 00:47:52.930
<v Speaker 3>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have pregnant,</v>

1216
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:56.200
<v Speaker 3>you were going to get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And thus we wanted to incentivize people</v>

1217
00:47:56.201 --> 00:47:58.990
<v Speaker 3>to stick around for that because single </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherhood is bad for the community.</v>

1218
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 3>And so we're going to subsidize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>with tax benefits.</v>

1219
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:02.974
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no,</v>

1220
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 3>there is no marriage benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a marriage penalty.</v>

1221
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.273
<v Speaker 3>My wife and I pay a significantly higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>tax rate because we have a combined </v>

1222
00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:08.710
<v Speaker 3>income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1223
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 3>So you're not against still despite </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from some sort of.</v>

1224
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:14.650
<v Speaker 3>It's not a religious art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious art.</v>

1225
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want to distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of court,</v>

1226
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 3>because we should be for a separation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>church and state.</v>

1227
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:20.880
<v Speaker 3>And I think you are for separation </v>
<v Speaker 3>truths.</v>

1228
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:21.723
<v Speaker 3>So the separation of church and state </v>
<v Speaker 3>means that I just want to make a quick </v>

1229
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:26.320
<v Speaker 3>distinction or separation of church and </v>
<v Speaker 3>state doesn't mean that I can't bring my</v>

1230
00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:27.154
<v Speaker 3>religious values to bear and how I vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just means that I can't leverage </v>

1231
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.053
<v Speaker 3>Jewish ritual on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no establishment of Jewish </v>

1232
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:34.420
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian religion.</v>

1233
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:35.254
<v Speaker 3>But I should be able to make a secular </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument for why what I'm saying is </v>

1234
00:48:38.111 --> 00:48:38.944
<v Speaker 3>right is my general rule because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise we're operating in different </v>

1235
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 3>spheres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I cite the Bible,</v>

1236
00:48:42.131 --> 00:48:43.000
<v Speaker 3>it makes no difference to you.</v>

1237
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 3>You don't care about the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1238
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

1239
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm a secular Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would consider,</v>

1240
00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.553
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm an atheist so it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judaism is ethnic and irrelevant every </v>

1241
00:48:52.421 --> 00:48:53.410
<v Speaker 3>other respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like her.</v>

1242
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 3>You like her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Curb your enthusiasm?</v>

1243
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:56.373
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1244
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:57.283
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's cultural Judaism like </v>

1245
00:48:58.631 --> 00:49:00.730
<v Speaker 3>bagels and Matzah balls and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>care,</v>

1246
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:02.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel pretty good it.</v>

1247
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:02.801
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1248
00:49:02.801 --> 00:49:03.634
<v Speaker 3>so let's not get hung up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're making the distinction </v>

1249
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:08.050
<v Speaker 3>between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't coming from a religious place</v>

1250
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:09.063
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the problem when it </v>

1251
00:49:09.671 --> 00:49:12.940
<v Speaker 3>comes to gay marriage is that a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>portion of the Christian right is trying</v>

1252
00:49:12.941 --> 00:49:15.570
<v Speaker 3>to impose their religious values on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1253
00:49:15.571 --> 00:49:16.404
<v Speaker 3>So it itself isn't religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Po know the rationale for the </v>

1254
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:20.163
<v Speaker 3>policy can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one where I'm making the </v>

1255
00:49:20.741 --> 00:49:21.574
<v Speaker 3>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rationale for people voting can </v>

1256
00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:25.420
<v Speaker 3>still be religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if the policy is not religious,</v>

1257
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 3>if there's a secular rationality is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scalia said about it actually,</v>

1258
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.600
<v Speaker 3>if there's a secular rationale to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the motivations of the voters don't</v>

1259
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

1260
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.033
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't care what the motivation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the voter is in virtually any </v>

1261
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 3>circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I matter what the vote is.</v>

1262
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.013
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if somebody wants to vote for lower </v>

1263
00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:39.874
<v Speaker 3>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care whether they're doing it </v>

1264
00:49:40.451 --> 00:49:41.284
<v Speaker 3>because they're on principle for lower </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes or whether they personally want </v>

1265
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:45.154
<v Speaker 3>lower taxes on their income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just care about the outcome of the </v>

1266
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 3>vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outcome with a boat.</v>

1267
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:48.154
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically you don't care about gay </v>

1268
00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:53.550
<v Speaker 3>marriage as the contract ends right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you simply don't care.</v>

1269
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:58.060
<v Speaker 3>You're one concern though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that ultimately this will lead to the</v>

1270
00:49:58.061 --> 00:50:01.750
<v Speaker 3>government forcing gay marriage on </v>
<v Speaker 3>synagogues that don't want to have it,</v>

1271
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 3>or mosques that don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Ultimately.</v>

1272
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:04.444
<v Speaker 3>Like now in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've already passed laws that you </v>

1273
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:07.234
<v Speaker 3>have to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same sex marriage in public schools for </v>

1274
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:09.034
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it changes the nature of the </v>

1275
00:50:09.671 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 3>teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My view on that is,</v>

1276
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why the.</v>

1277
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I went to public school for elementary </v>
<v Speaker 3>and junior high.</v>

1278
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why the government is</v>
<v Speaker 3>teaching me anything about this stuff.</v>

1279
00:50:16.631 --> 00:50:18.720
<v Speaker 3>This is for my parents to teach me like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1280
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:19.583
<v Speaker 3>This is a values thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess that's sort of where it's </v>

1281
00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.554
<v Speaker 3>just values just get completed with what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're taught like well as sort of a to </v>

1282
00:50:27.161 --> 00:50:29.120
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are no values to math right</v>

1283
00:50:29.121 --> 00:50:29.954
<v Speaker 3>there no valid Matthew Bright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are no values to biology </v>

1284
00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.070
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their,</v>

1285
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.370
<v Speaker 3>their values to history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why it's dicey and it's.</v>

1286
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 3>And it's disingenuous what the left has </v>
<v Speaker 3>done with the education system.</v>

1287
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:41.220
<v Speaker 3>There are multiple perspectives on </v>
<v Speaker 3>history and the monopolistic takeover of</v>

1288
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:42.343
<v Speaker 3>the liberal arts is a real problem and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have multiple perspectives on </v>

1289
00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:45.824
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're not teaching marriage in the </v>

1290
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 3>context of history or English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're teaching in the context of science</v>

1291
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 3>which has nothing to do with anything.</v>

1292
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.880
<v Speaker 3>So when again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you a PC comes in.</v>

1293
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1294
00:50:53.741 --> 00:50:55.790
<v Speaker 3>when they're doing sex ed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in junior high,</v>

1295
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.910
<v Speaker 3>they're making a big deal out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that everybody,</v>

1296
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:59.803
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody is equally likely due to get </v>

1297
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:02.720
<v Speaker 3>aids for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not True.</v>

1298
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just not true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it aids is a behavioral driven </v>

1299
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 3>disease or if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will never get aids.</v>

1300
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:08.683
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barring a barring a blood transfusion </v>

1301
00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:11.680
<v Speaker 3>that that has aids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1302
00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:12.623
<v Speaker 3>I don't do an intravenous drugs and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have promiscuous sex and I was a </v>

1303
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:17.350
<v Speaker 3>virgin when I married my wife and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a virgin when she married me.</v>

1304
00:51:17.351 --> 00:51:18.190
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're,</v>

1305
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.200
<v Speaker 3>we're safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1306
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.620
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1307
00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:20.453
<v Speaker 3>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're about to save as you can get on </v>

1308
00:51:21.201 --> 00:51:22.970
<v Speaker 3>this and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't like the,</v>

1309
00:51:22.971 --> 00:51:23.804
<v Speaker 3>the again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the facts being trumped by what we </v>

1310
00:51:26.661 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 3>wished the facts were so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>push certain political agendas.</v>

1311
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.133
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you then taking this argument </v>

1312
00:51:33.201 --> 00:51:34.034
<v Speaker 1>from a secular place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you then feel being in the same </v>

1313
00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:36.944
<v Speaker 1>party that have so many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking it from a right wing Christian </v>

1314
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:42.630
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there isn't there.</v>

1315
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a seemingly odd alliance there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is a.</v>

1316
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I agree with them on the end point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I even agree with them religiously.</v>

1317
00:51:48.951 --> 00:51:50.830
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think they're good </v>
<v Speaker 3>spokespeople for their cars.</v>

1318
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:52.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you,</v>

1319
00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.481
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are,</v>

1320
00:51:53.481 --> 00:51:56.420
<v Speaker 3>if you're a chief citation to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposition to gay marriage,</v>

1321
00:51:56.421 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 3>is leviticus 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>22?</v>

1322
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.993
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that's a solid </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument that's going to convince a lot </v>

1323
00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:02.534
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1324
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.351
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

1325
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:04.184
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are better arguments against gay </v>

1326
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:06.310
<v Speaker 3>marriage than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1327
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1328
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.113
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something I talk about at </v>

1329
00:52:08.661 --> 00:52:09.494
<v Speaker 3>religious schools and I've been asked by</v>
<v Speaker 3>pastors and rabbis and priests to talk </v>

1330
00:52:13.011 --> 00:52:14.540
<v Speaker 3>to students about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1331
00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:15.374
<v Speaker 3>you have these religious principles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any justification outside of </v>

1332
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.840
<v Speaker 3>the Bible says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for why this is correct.</v>

1333
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 3>And as a religious person who actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought through his positions,</v>

1334
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I tend to believe there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I see it as a religious person.</v>

1335
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:30.080
<v Speaker 3>I believe that God didn't create stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>

1336
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:32.300
<v Speaker 3>So if you believe that God didn't create</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid rules,</v>

1337
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.433
<v Speaker 3>then you have to come up with some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of justification for the rules that are </v>

1338
00:52:36.501 --> 00:52:37.334
<v Speaker 3>being expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something you can </v>

1339
00:52:38.361 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 3>understand that just an article of </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith,</v>

1340
00:52:40.011 --> 00:52:40.810
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1341
00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big ones about human behavior,</v>

1342
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.633
<v Speaker 3>there should be a decent rationale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can explain to people who don't buy </v>

1343
00:52:45.861 --> 00:52:46.880
<v Speaker 3>into revelation.</v>

1344
00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there I would just say,</v>

1345
00:52:48.761 --> 00:52:50.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basing your belief in God.</v>

1346
00:52:50.411 --> 00:52:52.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just a belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not anything that can be proven,</v>

1347
00:52:52.661 --> 00:52:55.390
<v Speaker 1>so relative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

1348
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:55.571
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1349
00:52:55.571 --> 00:52:56.404
<v Speaker 1>but anyone that's basing anything on </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion is just based on some unproven </v>

1350
00:53:00.341 --> 00:53:01.174
<v Speaker 1>thing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I want that nothing to do </v>

1351
00:53:02.261 --> 00:53:02.900
<v Speaker 1>with my life</v>

1352
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:03.733
<v Speaker 3>that which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fine and that's why we live in </v>

1353
00:53:04.641 --> 00:53:05.400
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1354
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1355
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.890
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I will say this,</v>

1356
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 3>every belief system is based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something unproven.</v>

1357
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:11.480
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human rights means nothing.</v>

1358
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Where do you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your basis of human rights</v>

1359
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:14.370
<v Speaker 1>from a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

1360
00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just get you to subjective.</v>

1361
00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:17.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1362
00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:18.870
<v Speaker 1>But that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a blend.</v>

1363
00:53:18.871 --> 00:53:21.390
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying basically where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals would say,</v>

1364
00:53:21.391 --> 00:53:22.224
<v Speaker 1>I'm for this because I'm for gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want gay people to be able to do what </v>

1365
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.033
<v Speaker 1>want to do and</v>

1366
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.920
<v Speaker 3>pursue happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anyone else you would say,</v>

1367
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 3>well this has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>government and whatever.</v>

1368
00:53:31.201 --> 00:53:32.770
<v Speaker 3>So I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of.</v>

1369
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Not a lot of conflict here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.050
<v Speaker 3>My governmental policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm basically a libertarian is,</v>

1371
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 3>is I don't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1372
00:53:40.201 --> 00:53:41.034
<v Speaker 3>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we strengthen that group of </v>

1373
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 3>people so clearly we don't agree quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree on this thing,</v>

1374
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:46.283
<v Speaker 3>but I understand your rationale and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not trying to stop gay people </v>

1375
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:50.420
<v Speaker 3>from getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think right now,</v>

1376
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:53.430
<v Speaker 3>I think right now the next conflict is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to come from the right.</v>

1377
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come from the left pushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ball,</v>

1378
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:58.890
<v Speaker 3>meaning that it's going to come from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>case in Oregon with this Baker who,</v>

1379
00:53:58.891 --> 00:53:59.351
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1380
00:53:59.351 --> 00:54:01.470
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to service a same sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>wedding,</v>

1381
00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to actually have to cater </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1382
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as uh,</v>

1383
00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:05.124
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that good hearted people should </v>

1384
00:54:06.301 --> 00:54:06.901
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

1385
00:54:06.901 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 3>you do what you want.</v>

1386
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Go across the street to the bakery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1387
00:54:09.081 --> 00:54:10.100
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I would say.</v>

1388
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 3>And this is the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1389
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:13.164
<v Speaker 3>liberal and leftist in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the difference between liberal </v>

1390
00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:17.550
<v Speaker 3>and leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Liberal says your business,</v>

1391
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left.</v>

1392
00:54:18.771 --> 00:54:19.630
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1393
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.011
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1394
00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:22.410
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's imperative that you will be</v>

1395
00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:23.270
<v Speaker 3>made to care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1396
00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And Erik Erickson's phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be made to care.</v>

1397
00:54:25.111 --> 00:54:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Somebody is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a man will come to your house with a gun</v>

1398
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:29.940
<v Speaker 3>and he will tell you that if you do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>cater this wedding,</v>

1399
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.520
<v Speaker 3>this is what they were forced by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred $75,000,</v>

1400
00:54:32.521 --> 00:54:33.354
<v Speaker 3>fine for not catering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lesbian wedding or there's a bakery </v>

1401
00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:36.660
<v Speaker 3>across the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know this is,</v>

1402
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.260
<v Speaker 3>this is really an a farrier stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is where you're asking where the</v>

1403
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:42.750
<v Speaker 3>momentum comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where the momentum comes from.</v>

1404
00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:43.584
<v Speaker 3>So when I make an argument to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives and religious people that </v>

1405
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 3>the government ought to get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>business and marriage.</v>

1406
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that because I'm pro gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage,</v>

1407
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:52.260
<v Speaker 3>very much anti gay marriage in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>social sense.</v>

1408
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:54.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1409
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 3>as as a religious person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think homosexuality is a sin.</v>

1410
00:54:57.691 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 3>I think lots of things are sentenced </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people engage in.</v>

1411
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.170
<v Speaker 3>I think they should be free to engage in</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1412
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.540
<v Speaker 3>but as a religious person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>

1413
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:04.643
<v Speaker 3>That's not my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that gay marriage is a </v>

1414
00:55:06.271 --> 00:55:07.104
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massively good thing for society on a </v>

1415
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:10.920
<v Speaker 3>social level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on a governmental level,</v>

1416
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.070
<v Speaker 3>if you guys don't just get out of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>business entirely,</v>

1417
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.173
<v Speaker 3>the left has no end point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're only endpoint is using the </v>

1418
00:55:17.431 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 3>government as a club against you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now that they've got gay marriage,</v>

1419
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.230
<v Speaker 3>it will go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will go to.</v>

1420
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:23.363
<v Speaker 3>We're going to stop accrediting schools </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't teach gay marriage or higher </v>

1421
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 3>homosexual employees.</v>

1422
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've got Catholic churches say,</v>

1423
00:55:29.151 --> 00:55:29.984
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to pay the health benefits </v>
<v Speaker 3>of somebody gay partner that's a </v>

1424
00:55:32.231 --> 00:55:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Catholic church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why should it have to write?</v>

1425
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.340
<v Speaker 3>But the left would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1426
00:55:35.341 --> 00:55:37.080
<v Speaker 3>they have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will be made to care.</v>

1427
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:39.060
<v Speaker 3>This is why you're a bad person if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do this.</v>

1428
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 3>And so if so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I arguments?</v>

1429
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.000
<v Speaker 3>The rightest sensible liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1430
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:43.853
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is.</v>

1431
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:44.803
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this way you'd actually get heavy </v>

1432
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:46.044
<v Speaker 3>argument from the not so sensible </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals probably including all of the </v>

1433
00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:49.194
<v Speaker 3>democratic nominees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the fact is that what I'm saying is </v>

1434
00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:56.340
<v Speaker 3>the best argument for the Libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>position on the right here is gonna be a</v>

1435
00:55:56.341 --> 00:55:58.410
<v Speaker 3>rear guard action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be.</v>

1436
00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.433
<v Speaker 3>It's better for straight people be in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bad for gay marriage to get it out </v>

1437
00:56:01.951 --> 00:56:02.784
<v Speaker 3>of that realm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's I think that if you want to fight </v>

1438
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:05.154
<v Speaker 3>against gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it on the social level with your </v>

1439
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:06.714
<v Speaker 3>church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>teach your kids what you want to teach </v>

1440
00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:09.030
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to,</v>

1441
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:11.340
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to making this argument to</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives,</v>

1442
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.420
<v Speaker 3>the real argument is if you don't take </v>
<v Speaker 3>power out of the hands of government,</v>

1443
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.990
<v Speaker 3>if you don't take that ring away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gollum and throw it into mount zoom,</v>

1444
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 3>then it will be used against you.</v>

1445
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:23.110
<v Speaker 3>There will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government is just government is the</v>

1446
00:56:23.111 --> 00:56:23.330
<v Speaker 3>rate.</v>

1447
00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:24.163
<v Speaker 1>So does this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I my direct message at the top of the </v>

1448
00:56:25.641 --> 00:56:26.474
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about just how stupid our </v>

1449
00:56:27.111 --> 00:56:30.200
<v Speaker 1>election system is and how everything's </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to soundbites and everything in our</v>

1450
00:56:30.201 --> 00:56:34.400
<v Speaker 1>debate is so nonsensical and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything you just laid out there is</v>

1451
00:56:34.401 --> 00:56:35.234
<v Speaker 1>a much more clean and clear explanation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and where you actually are separating </v>

1452
00:56:38.271 --> 00:56:40.790
<v Speaker 1>church and state and doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual rigor to,</v>

1453
00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.713
<v Speaker 1>to make a sensible argument where if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk for the little bit that </v>

1454
00:56:43.971 --> 00:56:44.804
<v Speaker 1>they've talked about gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm glad because I don't think it </v>

1455
00:56:46.041 --> 00:56:46.874
<v Speaker 1>should be talked about that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It let it be and that that will be fine </v>

1456
00:56:48.981 --> 00:56:50.340
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1457
00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.480
<v Speaker 1>but nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1458
00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Marco Rubio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about the family,</v>

1459
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:56.600
<v Speaker 1>but he's purely doing it from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious perspective.</v>

1460
00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an identity politics that's been</v>

1461
00:56:58.271 --> 00:57:00.970
<v Speaker 3>created on the right in response to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics of the left.</v>

1462
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 3>So if we're going to be attacked as </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious people,</v>

1463
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:06.610
<v Speaker 3>we have to talk as religious people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to go preach from a pulpit and if</v>

1464
00:57:06.611 --> 00:57:08.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't cite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1465
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 3>if I don't say genesis to talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man shall leave his,</v>

1466
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.990
<v Speaker 3>a man shall leave his parents and cling </v>
<v Speaker 3>to his wife.</v>

1467
00:57:12.991 --> 00:57:14.230
<v Speaker 3>If I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I don't cite that,</v>

1468
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.393
<v Speaker 3>then I haven't spoken to the incode that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows that I care about the values of </v>

1469
00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:20.240
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you and the,</v>

1470
00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 3>and this is the way the political game </v>
<v Speaker 3>is played,</v>

1471
00:57:21.851 --> 00:57:22.684
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of wished that Americans would </v>

1472
00:57:23.861 --> 00:57:25.900
<v Speaker 3>see through the political game on all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides,</v>

1473
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:27.460
<v Speaker 3>meaning I wish religious people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>just say,</v>

1474
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.593
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand you're anti gay marriage </v>

1475
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 3>and I also understand what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>here to protect religious people and you</v>

1476
00:57:32.921 --> 00:57:33.754
<v Speaker 3>don't have to cite Bible verses at me to</v>
<v Speaker 3>prove it and it and you end up with </v>

1477
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:39.250
<v Speaker 3>idiocies like Donald Trump on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>waving around a bible,</v>

1478
00:57:39.251 --> 00:57:40.084
<v Speaker 3>pretending he gives a damn what's in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ms dot two after two marriages and </v>

1479
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:43.763
<v Speaker 3>several adulterous affairs and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bragging about having his </v>

1480
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:48.550
<v Speaker 3>experiences with married women standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there with the Bible and going,</v>

1481
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:52.590
<v Speaker 3>this is an even better book than the out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the deal is if this is,</v>

1482
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 3>this is how you vote.</v>

1483
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.150
<v Speaker 3>If you're able to be pandered to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1484
00:57:55.151 --> 00:57:57.820
<v Speaker 3>that's a sad commentary on American </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics and in its way.</v>

1485
00:57:57.821 --> 00:58:00.550
<v Speaker 3>It's really no different from Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton going to the black community and</v>

1486
00:58:00.551 --> 00:58:01.640
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the victims.</v>

1487
00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.790
<v Speaker 3>You're the victims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm going to speak the language.</v>

1488
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:05.320
<v Speaker 3>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

1489
00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 3>here's how you know that I care about </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1490
00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not big into caring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1491
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.491
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1492
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:10.324
<v Speaker 3>I think that people who presumed to care</v>
<v Speaker 3>about you are generally people who want </v>

1493
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:17.480
<v Speaker 3>the power to control your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only people that,</v>

1494
00:58:17.481 --> 00:58:18.314
<v Speaker 3>that I want power in their lives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want power in my life or my </v>

1495
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:22.630
<v Speaker 3>immediate family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1496
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.711
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my parents,</v>

1497
00:58:23.711 --> 00:58:25.390
<v Speaker 3>my sisters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>

1498
00:58:25.391 --> 00:58:27.750
<v Speaker 3>my children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their independent human beings too.</v>

1499
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So caring,</v>

1500
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.733
<v Speaker 3>caring is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the way that caring is the way that </v>

1501
00:58:31.931 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Speaker 3>the left controls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they never,</v>

1502
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:34.660
<v Speaker 3>they don't come with the Jack boots </v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

1503
00:58:34.661 --> 00:58:36.340
<v Speaker 3>They first come and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we care so much about you.</v>

1504
00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 3>We have to do these things for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

1505
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:39.790
<v Speaker 3>we brought some guns to help out.</v>

1506
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.713
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it shows sort of the beauty or the </v>

1507
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:45.490
<v Speaker 1>scariness of identity politics because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds really good.</v>

1508
00:58:45.491 --> 00:58:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I guess what they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism will come with a big smile,</v>

1509
00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:48.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1510
00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.800
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is John Goldberg's point in Liberal</v>

1511
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1512
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1513
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:52.990
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we only have a couple minutes left,</v>

1514
00:58:52.991 --> 00:58:53.824
<v Speaker 1>but let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just knock out a couple of other </v>

1515
00:58:54.611 --> 00:58:55.444
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I saw when you were on piers Morgan </v>

1516
00:58:57.011 --> 00:58:57.844
<v Speaker 1>with that whole gun thing way back when </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I watched it again in preparation </v>

1517
00:59:00.521 --> 00:59:03.310
<v Speaker 1>for this and I never liked piers Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was doing a talk.</v>

1518
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Show you the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope people don't view me in that way,</v>

1519
00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.413
<v Speaker 1>but what you did with him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument was really kind of brilliant </v>

1520
00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 1>and it goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes to some of the 11th before.</v>

1521
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:14.650
<v Speaker 1>But before even ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1522
00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't really agree with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your stance on guns.</v>

1523
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:18.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can you sort of recap happened and </v>

1524
00:59:21.631 --> 00:59:22.080
<v Speaker 1>then we'll show</v>

1525
00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 3>her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1526
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.690
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trump,</v>

1527
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 3>now that you've complimented me like </v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten free person,</v>

1528
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 3>now you're a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read the,</v>

1529
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.880
<v Speaker 3>it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

1530
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:31.993
<v Speaker 3>what happened in that debate is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>piers Morgan had basically been doing a </v>

1531
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 3>lot of the things we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>for weeks.</v>

1532
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:36.524
<v Speaker 3>You'd been saying after Sandy Hook that </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who disagreed with him on gun </v>

1533
00:59:38.931 --> 00:59:39.764
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only possible reason to disagree </v>

1534
00:59:41.001 --> 00:59:44.480
<v Speaker 3>with him is because you don't care about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened on gun control and you saw</v>

1535
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1536
00:59:45.921 --> 00:59:48.200
<v Speaker 3>after the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the last mass shooting right after</v>

1537
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Umpqua community college and he got up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and,</v>

1538
00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:52.173
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did the teary eyed routine and I </v>

1539
00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 3>don't like tears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

1540
00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Like just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just give me your policy.</v>

1541
00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 3>So what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I said to the tiers,</v>

1542
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I think design in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1543
01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:04.360
<v Speaker 3>It is tiring out over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bama,</v>

1544
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.730
<v Speaker 3>and I think Obama is an unusually </v>
<v Speaker 3>skilled politician and I think he worked</v>

1545
01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:08.564
<v Speaker 3>himself up to tears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I think that good actors </v>

1546
01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:11.740
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

1547
01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1548
01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the emotion is fake is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I don't think they motions fake,</v>

1549
01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:16.760
<v Speaker 3>but the emotional factors isn't fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

1550
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:18.710
<v Speaker 3>If you talked to actors who work </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves up to tears,</v>

1551
01:00:18.711 --> 01:00:20.510
<v Speaker 3>they actually feel sad when they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>crying.</v>

1552
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.130
<v Speaker 3>That's how you get yourself to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1553
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I think Obama worked himself up there </v>
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise you'd be fine.</v>

1554
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you'd be crying every other </v>
<v Speaker 3>press conference.</v>

1555
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:28.544
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about all sorts of crap </v>

1556
01:00:28.881 --> 01:00:30.380
<v Speaker 3>that goes on in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible.</v>

1557
01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.233
<v Speaker 3>Like how many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time he gets out there and you </v>

1558
01:00:32.451 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 3>talked about the economy be crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1559
01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.110
<v Speaker 3>you'd be completely emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>unstable.</v>

1560
01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.730
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

1561
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:38.221
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1562
01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:39.054
<v Speaker 3>so what I said to Piers Morgan is I said</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bully and the way that you </v>

1563
01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:42.884
<v Speaker 3>bullied people as you stand on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>graves of the children of Sandy Hook to </v>

1564
01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 3>push her political agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't know how to come back from</v>

1565
01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:50.330
<v Speaker 3>that because that was his entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy and now it had been unmasked.</v>

1566
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.373
<v Speaker 3>And actually during the break he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>planned to bring in a kid who had been </v>

1567
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 3>shot and was in a wheelchair and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1568
01:00:55.911 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 3>you've said it to me now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say it to the small pool,</v>

1569
01:00:58.050 --> 01:00:58.883
<v Speaker 3>a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he couldn't do it because if you've </v>

1570
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:01.430
<v Speaker 3>done that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I immediately would have said,</v>

1571
01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:02.264
<v Speaker 3>first you stood on the graves of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids and now you're standing on this </v>

1572
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.390
<v Speaker 3>poor guy's wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

1573
01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:06.883
<v Speaker 3>But it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was sort of the content of the </v>

1574
01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:11.560
<v Speaker 3>argument he tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to throw the.</v>

1575
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 3>The Ronald Reagan was in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>banning assault weapons at me.</v>

1576
01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't care as I've said what Ronald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Reagan had to say.</v>

1577
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.250
<v Speaker 3>He was a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes he's right.</v>

1578
01:01:19.251 --> 01:01:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes he's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he wasn't a God.</v>

1579
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1580
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.170
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1581
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.160
<v Speaker 3>that has a religious person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only have one and got him.</v>

1582
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1583
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:29.190
<v Speaker 3>So that's not the one we knew that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew there was more.</v>

1584
01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not Reagan.</v>

1585
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:31.611
<v Speaker 3>Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1586
01:01:31.611 --> 01:01:32.710
<v Speaker 3>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know,</v>

1587
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:33.620
<v Speaker 3>cause he's not back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1588
01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>He could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could be weird.</v>

1589
01:01:36.691 --> 01:01:37.090
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1590
01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>So my feelings on the gun thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

1591
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>because I believe in the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment,</v>

1592
01:01:41.581 --> 01:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>people should have access to guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you clear.</v>

1593
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>It's clear after an hour together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a huge fan of the government,</v>

1594
01:01:46.621 --> 01:01:47.454
<v Speaker 1>so I do believe people should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect themselves and all of those </v>

1595
01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think is that we're.</v>

1596
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>We should be able to control it a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more than we are a.</v>

1597
01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:55.653
<v Speaker 1>I think that the NRA does wield too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and then I would say at the same </v>

1598
01:01:58.531 --> 01:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>time as I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things can be true.</v>

1599
01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:01.284
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a massive mental health problem </v>

1600
01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:03.624
<v Speaker 1>in this country and that's the part that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about because every </v>

1601
01:02:05.761 --> 01:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>commercial for every cable news channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>is for some other drug that it turns out</v>

1602
01:02:10.171 --> 01:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>that some crazy percentage of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooters are on.</v>

1603
01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it comes to gun violence,</v>

1604
01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:14.734
<v Speaker 3>there's two problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an inner city violence which </v>

1605
01:02:16.031 --> 01:02:16.864
<v Speaker 3>really is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a matter of gang violence and and </v>

1606
01:02:18.731 --> 01:02:21.960
<v Speaker 3>people shooting each other unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're.</v>

1607
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 3>Because they're involved in gangs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's happening every day in Chicago,</v>

1608
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:26.634
<v Speaker 3>but we've never actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Los Angeles and Washington DC and </v>

1609
01:02:29.161 --> 01:02:29.994
<v Speaker 3>all the major cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is all the heavily gun </v>

1610
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.610
<v Speaker 3>controlled areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic areas.</v>

1611
01:02:32.611 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 3>These are the places where people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting killed on mass and then you have</v>

1612
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 3>the mass shooting issue and the mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting issue is largely because in the</v>

1613
01:02:39.151 --> 01:02:40.500
<v Speaker 3>19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 19 seventies,</v>

1614
01:02:40.501 --> 01:02:41.334
<v Speaker 3>this is the one area where I think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government actually should be involved </v>

1615
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:43.763
<v Speaker 3>in the 19 sixties in 19 seventies there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a decision that was made basically </v>

1616
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:47.484
<v Speaker 3>all across the country to empty out all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mental facilities because there was </v>

1617
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:52.470
<v Speaker 3>an idea that went around the country and</v>
<v Speaker 3>gained a lot of traction.</v>

1618
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.080
<v Speaker 3>That mental illness was basically one </v>
<v Speaker 3>flew over the cuckoo's nest.</v>

1619
01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was seriously crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was just eccentric and this is</v>

1620
01:02:57.901 --> 01:02:59.580
<v Speaker 3>why you have a mass growth and homeless </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1621
01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:00.414
<v Speaker 3>In 1960 there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people do you think in 1960 </v>

1622
01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:04.530
<v Speaker 3>were in mental institutions in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States?</v>

1623
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine.</v>

1624
01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:08.250
<v Speaker 3>I would guess half a million or half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>

1625
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Half a million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1626
01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:11.370
<v Speaker 3>And we had half the population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then right?</v>

1627
01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Today there's 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in mental facilities.</v>

1628
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:14.873
<v Speaker 3>So you've got a lot of violent people on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the streets and so you have a lot of </v>

1629
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:17.694
<v Speaker 3>island people on the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to end up with more mass </v>

1630
01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:21.450
<v Speaker 3>shootings and that's why every time </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a mass shooting,</v>

1631
01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:22.284
<v Speaker 3>almost invariably it's somebody who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy and we've known they're crazy and </v>

1632
01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:26.304
<v Speaker 3>involuntary commitment laws are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really difficult because you have to </v>

1633
01:03:29.191 --> 01:03:30.024
<v Speaker 3>show that the person is a threat to </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves or others as opposed to the </v>

1634
01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:35.130
<v Speaker 3>old standard which was they're incapable</v>
<v Speaker 3>of caring for themselves.</v>

1635
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 3>One of the big problems with paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia,</v>

1636
01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:41.010
<v Speaker 3>which is flooded a lot of these shooters</v>
<v Speaker 3>a is that you have the.</v>

1637
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:41.844
<v Speaker 3>You have a condition where you literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't even recognize that you have the </v>

1638
01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:44.544
<v Speaker 3>condition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you won't take your drugs if we let </v>

1639
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:46.644
<v Speaker 3>you out and you'll just go off the drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll go right back to doing what </v>

1640
01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:49.490
<v Speaker 3>it was that you were doing in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

1641
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.333
<v Speaker 3>And the drugs often is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are off the drugs and it's </v>

1642
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:53.574
<v Speaker 3>people that are on most of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the people who are committing </v>

1643
01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:56.814
<v Speaker 3>these acts are not on heavy medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the people who are committing </v>

1644
01:03:58.411 --> 01:03:59.244
<v Speaker 3>these acts are people who have gone off </v>
<v Speaker 3>their medication and they have </v>

1645
01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:02.910
<v Speaker 3>significant mental illness and they need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be medicated.</v>

1646
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:05.020
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an area where the,</v>

1647
01:04:05.021 --> 01:04:07.080
<v Speaker 3>the mental health system is dramatically</v>
<v Speaker 3>underfunded.</v>

1648
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.680
<v Speaker 3>The laws are complete when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who legitimately cannot take care</v>

1649
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 3>of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking and I'm speaking as somebody</v>

1650
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:13.674
<v Speaker 3>whose grandfather was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a schizophrenia who went into a </v>

1651
01:04:15.631 --> 01:04:17.610
<v Speaker 3>mental hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave them lithium and then he spent</v>

1652
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>the rest of his life as a happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>productive human being,</v>

1653
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:20.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1654
01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:20.893
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are things that might not have </v>

1655
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:22.940
<v Speaker 3>been possible now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

1656
01:04:22.941 --> 01:04:24.000
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1657
01:04:24.001 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 3>this is an area where I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think that there's,</v>

1658
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:28.674
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a role for the government in </v>

1659
01:04:29.581 --> 01:04:32.190
<v Speaker 3>this because this is John Locke would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have thought the same.</v>

1660
01:04:32.191 --> 01:04:33.370
<v Speaker 3>John Locke said this in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1661
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 3>in his writings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that,</v>

1662
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem of mental illnesses.</v>

1663
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:38.640
<v Speaker 3>One that sort of falls on society as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole because you have a group of people</v>

1664
01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:39.474
<v Speaker 3>who can't take care of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the real problem with mass </v>

1665
01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:42.530
<v Speaker 3>shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1666
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.440
<v Speaker 3>taking my guns away from me or taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>another law abiding person's,</v>

1667
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:46.283
<v Speaker 3>gotten away from them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to stop the mass </v>

1668
01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:49.160
<v Speaker 3>shooter.</v>

1669
01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:49.993
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact it's probably going to create </v>

1670
01:04:51.451 --> 01:04:53.700
<v Speaker 3>more mass shootings because now I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend myself.</v>

1671
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.030
<v Speaker 3>So would you say the NRA is a problem at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in,</v>

1672
01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:57.140
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the thing,</v>

1673
01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.013
<v Speaker 3>the NRA is incredibly valuable </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization because it's pushing </v>

1674
01:05:00.241 --> 01:05:01.074
<v Speaker 3>against people on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to agree with everything </v>

1675
01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:04.974
<v Speaker 3>the NRA says to think that they are an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly valuable organization that's </v>

1676
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 3>channeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1677
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:09.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1678
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.690
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the legal hopes of a lot of Americans to</v>

1679
01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:13.524
<v Speaker 3>protect the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're about one vote away on the </v>

1680
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Supreme Court from the Second Amendment </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappearing entirely.</v>

1681
01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.740
<v Speaker 3>So let's just do some stuff in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it,</v>

1682
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:21.574
<v Speaker 3>that's how we can add this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with this whole thing with Scalia </v>

1683
01:05:22.871 --> 01:05:25.600
<v Speaker 3>right now and this spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you stand on this?</v>

1684
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:28.360
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that Obama has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nominate someone that's his job.</v>

1685
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 3>He's the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the president right now.</v>

1686
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.460
<v Speaker 3>He can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have to,</v>

1687
01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.250
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it was a republican,</v>

1688
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 3>of course he was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now that it's up and I don't care if</v>

1689
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:39.310
<v Speaker 3>he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

1690
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.173
<v Speaker 3>he has the capacity to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that he's </v>

1691
01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:42.664
<v Speaker 3>actually allowed to do as president that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing as opposed to all the other </v>

1692
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 3>things he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which she's not allowed to do,</v>

1693
01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.890
<v Speaker 3>but we've got to finish up so we have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>focus on this one.</v>

1694
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:48.581
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1695
01:05:48.581 --> 01:05:49.414
<v Speaker 3>so we're in agreement on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they say it will be up to the </v>

1696
01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:52.600
<v Speaker 3>Senate to either confirm this person or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1697
01:05:52.601 --> 01:05:53.800
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to give him an up or </v>
<v Speaker 3>down vote though,</v>

1698
01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:54.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever they want.</v>

1699
01:05:54.911 --> 01:05:56.680
<v Speaker 3>So what do you make of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

1700
01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:57.514
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitch Mcconnell and the rest of these </v>

1701
01:05:58.181 --> 01:05:59.140
<v Speaker 3>guys that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1702
01:05:59.141 --> 01:05:59.974
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shouldn't even nominate anybody and </v>

1703
01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:01.400
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

1704
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an idiotic line of </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

1705
01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a really dumb line of </v>

1706
01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:07.030
<v Speaker 3>argument was I wrote my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Harvard law school and I wrote</v>

1707
01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:07.864
<v Speaker 3>my third year paper at Harvard law </v>
<v Speaker 3>school on the idea that Marbury versus </v>

1708
01:06:10.061 --> 01:06:10.894
<v Speaker 3>Madison was wrongly decided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the supreme court </v>

1709
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.910
<v Speaker 3>should have the capacity to decide for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

1710
01:06:15.911 --> 01:06:16.744
<v Speaker 3>like for conservatives to think that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire future of the constitution </v>

1711
01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:22.270
<v Speaker 3>restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skulled one guy not dying is really sad.</v>

1712
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:22.821
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1713
01:06:22.821 --> 01:06:23.654
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is because the </v>

1714
01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:28.000
<v Speaker 3>supreme court has now been seen as this </v>
<v Speaker 3>great moral arbiter.</v>

1715
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.073
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the supreme court has been </v>

1716
01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:32.070
<v Speaker 3>responsible for some of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision in,</v>

1717
01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.210
<v Speaker 3>in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1718
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 3>the supreme court is responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>row,</v>

1719
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:35.674
<v Speaker 3>which is a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The supreme court was responsible for </v>

1720
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:38.080
<v Speaker 3>plessy versus Ferguson.</v>

1721
01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Everybody always wants to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown versus board.</v>

1722
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 3>If they'd gotten plessy right in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place,</v>

1723
01:06:41.801 --> 01:06:44.320
<v Speaker 3>you don't need brown versus board and </v>
<v Speaker 3>segregation ends in 1900.</v>

1724
01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 3>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1725
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:48.250
<v Speaker 3>the supreme court is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a serious problem there.</v>

1726
01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:49.084
<v Speaker 3>Nine unelected people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't even care about the </v>

1727
01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:51.154
<v Speaker 3>unelected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their their nine people who are </v>

1728
01:06:52.181 --> 01:06:55.630
<v Speaker 3>given the power to control everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>life in the name of a document that most</v>

1729
01:06:55.631 --> 01:06:58.720
<v Speaker 3>of them don't even take seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the irony with the Supreme Court</v>

1730
01:06:58.721 --> 01:06:59.554
<v Speaker 3>that they're supposed to be above </v>
<v Speaker 3>partisan politics and yet the whole </v>

1731
01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:05.770
<v Speaker 3>system to get them there is part of and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they're part of seeing themselves.</v>

1732
01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lightening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kagan is a hardcore Democrat.</v>

1733
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Elena Kagan was the solicitor general </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1734
01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:10.560
<v Speaker 3>for Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

1735
01:07:10.561 --> 01:07:11.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I.</v>

1736
01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:12.244
<v Speaker 3>I went to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was the dean when I was at Harvard </v>

1737
01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 3>law school.</v>

1738
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.373
<v Speaker 3>She was a hardcore leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you know the idea that people are </v>

1739
01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:18.760
<v Speaker 3>free of politics and what they call </v>
<v Speaker 3>legal realist.</v>

1740
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:22.060
<v Speaker 3>I believe that that means that virtually</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody is,</v>

1741
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.953
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has their perspective on life and that </v>

1742
01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:25.474
<v Speaker 3>comes out in how they and how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjudicate a and you have to work very </v>

1743
01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:31.300
<v Speaker 3>hard to remove yourself from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most judges don't.</v>

1744
01:07:31.301 --> 01:07:34.330
<v Speaker 3>I think most judges rule based on what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel like Anthony Kennedy,</v>

1745
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:36.820
<v Speaker 3>you can't tell them regardless what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about same sex marriage.</v>

1746
01:07:36.821 --> 01:07:37.654
<v Speaker 3>You cannot tell me that the constitution</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the United States or the 14th </v>

1747
01:07:40.031 --> 01:07:41.830
<v Speaker 3>amendment there too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was ratified in 18,</v>

1748
01:07:41.831 --> 01:07:42.664
<v Speaker 3>68,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was demanding that the state's not </v>

1749
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 3>passed laws in favor of traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>

1750
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:48.300
<v Speaker 3>That's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absurd.</v>

1751
01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:50.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he but equal protection.</v>

1752
01:07:50.021 --> 01:07:53.710
<v Speaker 3>He was using that or protection or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we should all be treated equally.</v>

1753
01:07:53.711 --> 01:07:56.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of crap because equal </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection does not mean that.</v>

1754
01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:58.330
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody,</v>

1755
01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 3>that a law should have an equal effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>on everyone.</v>

1756
01:08:01.091 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 3>No law has an equal effect on everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is whether the law itself,</v>

1757
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:06.003
<v Speaker 3>whether the law itself discriminates </v>
<v Speaker 3>against someone on the basis of an </v>

1758
01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:10.060
<v Speaker 3>immutable characteristic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the problems with,</v>

1759
01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.970
<v Speaker 3>with the whole gays are blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that gays are not black.</v>

1760
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:17.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean the fact is that a gay person who</v>
<v Speaker 3>has sex with another man is not going to</v>

1761
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.550
<v Speaker 3>manifest their homosexuality in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that society cares about.</v>

1762
01:08:21.570 --> 01:08:22.403
<v Speaker 3>They may be gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may have sex addicts to shoot up a </v>

1763
01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:25.040
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe,</v>

1764
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:26.180
<v Speaker 3>maybe he will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he won't.</v>

1765
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:27.014
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume that there,</v>

1766
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:28.600
<v Speaker 3>I assume that for the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred,</v>

1767
01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:29.733
<v Speaker 3>a couple of thousand years when gays </v>
<v Speaker 3>were not treated well in Western </v>

1768
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:32.714
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that not all the scrutiny gay people </v>

1769
01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:36.590
<v Speaker 3>were going and killing folks more </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable than that.</v>

1770
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1771
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:39.480
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gay people have the same selfcontrol</v>

1772
01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.330
<v Speaker 3>the straight people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there are any better.</v>

1773
01:08:41.331 --> 01:08:43.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're any worse in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their sexual self control.</v>

1774
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 3>And I will say that I think men in </v>
<v Speaker 3>general are less good in terms of sexual</v>

1775
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Speaker 3>assault control than women's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1776
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.273
<v Speaker 3>which explains why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why gay men have sex with more </v>

1777
01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:52.094
<v Speaker 3>people than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than straight men because women don't </v>

1778
01:08:53.331 --> 01:08:54.740
<v Speaker 3>want to have sex with men as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

1779
01:08:54.741 --> 01:08:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Wanna have sex with men have strong sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive.</v>

1780
01:08:57.690 --> 01:08:59.960
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's well off topic.</v>

1781
01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:00.794
<v Speaker 3>Back to the Scalia for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the problem here is that the </v>

1782
01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they say things like,</v>

1783
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.200
<v Speaker 3>it's the timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't the timeline,</v>

1784
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:10.363
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody replaces Justice Scalia who </v>

1785
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:14.060
<v Speaker 3>off the left and I don't care one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is if hillary gets elected,</v>

1786
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:15.860
<v Speaker 3>if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're 20 years from now,</v>

1787
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:18.950
<v Speaker 3>one more vote on the Supreme Court and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left is on the court,</v>

1788
01:09:18.951 --> 01:09:21.140
<v Speaker 3>do not see the constitution as a piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of law,</v>

1789
01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:21.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1790
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.440
<v Speaker 3>To be interpreted like the Sherman </v>
<v Speaker 3>antitrust act or obamacare.</v>

1791
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:25.363
<v Speaker 3>They see the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They see the constitution as a piece of </v>

1792
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:27.554
<v Speaker 3>poetry to be interpreted as their </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings dictate and this is the point </v>

1793
01:09:30.381 --> 01:09:31.910
<v Speaker 3>that I'm making about Kennedy through </v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

1794
01:09:31.911 --> 01:09:33.440
<v Speaker 3>through everything we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>

1795
01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:34.274
<v Speaker 3>and this is the point that I'm making </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Kennedy specifically in the gay </v>

1796
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:37.124
<v Speaker 3>marriage decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is not one iota of evidence that </v>

1797
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 3>the law that when it was written meant </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything to this effect or that it meant</v>

1798
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:44.984
<v Speaker 3>to leave an open space for the Supreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>Court to come in and leverage down on </v>

1799
01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:48.584
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same sex marriage laws mean what they </v>

1800
01:09:50.211 --> 01:09:51.670
<v Speaker 3>mean when they're written.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't mean what they are,</v>

1801
01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:53.390
<v Speaker 3>what they mean to a hundred years from </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1802
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.373
<v Speaker 3>If somebody picks up this interview in </v>
<v Speaker 3>200 years and starts to read into my </v>

1803
01:09:56.631 --> 01:09:59.570
<v Speaker 3>perspective that I'm super pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>homosexual behavior,</v>

1804
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I would be a little bit surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1805
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.900
<v Speaker 3>But that's essentially what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

1806
01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:05.000
<v Speaker 3>68.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's taking a clause that was written by</v>

1807
01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:05.834
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people who were very much not</v>
<v Speaker 3>in favor of even forget homosexual </v>

1808
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 3>marriage who criminalized sodomy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1809
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.340
<v Speaker 3>And saying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1810
01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:14.174
<v Speaker 3>well those people really meant what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>really meant here was pro same sex </v>

1811
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to make same sex marriage,</v>

1812
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:19.500
<v Speaker 3>legal make illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1813
01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:20.493
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you can do through the </v>

1814
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:24.770
<v Speaker 3>ballot box is the beauty of a republic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get to have nine unelected</v>

1815
01:10:24.771 --> 01:10:25.604
<v Speaker 3>judges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are these special moral people </v>

1816
01:10:26.631 --> 01:10:28.850
<v Speaker 3>who've been dinged by the hand of God?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe.</v>

1817
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.620
<v Speaker 3>I believe all human beings are capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>of good.</v>

1818
01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I believe all human beings are capable </v>
<v Speaker 3>of evil.</v>

1819
01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:35.990
<v Speaker 3>I believe all human beings are selfish </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of our are capable of altruism.</v>

1820
01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:36.973
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that there are nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect human beings who sit on the </v>

1821
01:10:38.721 --> 01:10:41.900
<v Speaker 3>supreme court and rule us as a magical </v>
<v Speaker 3>angelica oligarchy.</v>

1822
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a pretty solid ending to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1823
01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:45.890
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good to me.</v>

1824
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:46.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1825
01:10:46.581 --> 01:10:47.414
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we did here was exactly </v>

1826
01:10:48.171 --> 01:10:49.004
<v Speaker 1>what I want this to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't have to agree on </v>

1827
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:51.074
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do sense a sort of new center </v>

1828
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:55.430
<v Speaker 1>coming together with people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>

1829
01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.613
<v Speaker 1>That was my left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's there people that are on the </v>

1830
01:10:58.221 --> 01:10:59.054
<v Speaker 1>left and on the right that there's a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can be moral and it doesn't </v>

1831
01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:02.804
<v Speaker 1>necessarily have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion or you can be moral and it has </v>

1832
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.673
<v Speaker 1>to do with religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not how you want to be </v>

1833
01:11:07.251 --> 01:11:09.080
<v Speaker 1>governed and I think that's gonna be my </v>
<v Speaker 1>takeaway.</v>

1834
01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I think that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1835
01:11:11.191 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 3>as I say to people who disagree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the of the countries that you don't have</v>

1836
01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:15.114
<v Speaker 3>to care what I think the minute you </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring the government into saying that I </v>

1837
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:19.140
<v Speaker 3>have to care what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we're at odds.</v>

1838
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 3>So as long as the government is out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1839
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have these discussions all day</v>
<v Speaker 3>long and it's just good fun.</v>

1840
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:25.230
<v Speaker 3>The minute you bring the gun to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>party or the fascist,</v>

1841
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.093
<v Speaker 3>more importantly than any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milo Yiannopoulos is going to be so </v>

1842
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:30.240
<v Speaker 3>jealous that we sat here for an hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

1843
01:11:30.241 --> 01:11:31.074
<v Speaker 3>I want to thank a band and you can check</v>
<v Speaker 3>out his work pretty much all over the </v>

1844
01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:34.014
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I believe it's Benjamin Shapiro doc </v>

1845
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:38.130
<v Speaker 3>and go to daily wire is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best place to get a wire.com</v>

1846
01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:39.660
<v Speaker 3>and he's doing the breitbart thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

1847
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Thank you guys for watching and we'll do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it again next week.</v>
