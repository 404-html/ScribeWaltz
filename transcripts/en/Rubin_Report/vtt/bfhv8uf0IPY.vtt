1
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.963
<v Speaker 2>In America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to think that the news is all </v>

2
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 2>about us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some level,</v>

3
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.554
<v Speaker 2>you really can't blame us though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just turn on CNN or Fox News or Msnbc </v>

4
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.874
<v Speaker 2>and all you get these days is endless </v>
<v Speaker 2>election coverage with like a tiny bit </v>

5
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 2>of national news and maybe a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour on the international front.</v>

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally when something big flairs </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the talking heads,</v>

7
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 2>we'll focus on Syria or North Korea or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran for a couple days,</v>

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 2>but then it's quickly back to the usual </v>
<v Speaker 2>grind.</v>

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Even when something huge like brexit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

10
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 2>We barely talk about it in the u s until</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very last second when suddenly every</v>

11
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:40.614
<v Speaker 2>pundit who hasn't mentioned it once in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the past year is supposedly an expert </v>

12
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.503
<v Speaker 2>beyond hearing about terror attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we barely even talk about the countries </v>

13
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:49.374
<v Speaker 2>we have the most in common with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once the initial response to the attack </v>

14
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.334
<v Speaker 2>is over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has anything happened in the UK since </v>

15
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 2>brexit?</v>

16
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 2>What's been happening in France since </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Paris attacks?</v>

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 2>How are the toppest in Spain or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pasta in Italy or the cheese in Denmark?</v>

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.773
<v Speaker 2>You might know and I might know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I bet it's from alternative news </v>

19
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 2>sources and social media and not from </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream television.</v>

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.573
<v Speaker 2>The danger of only hearing about other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries when bad things happen like </v>

21
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 2>terror attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>riots and scandals,</v>

22
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:17.484
<v Speaker 2>is that you begin to think that's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is to these other places as </v>

23
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 2>well as the citizens that live there </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

24
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.743
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if other countries only </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated Americans with our current </v>

25
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many already do,</v>

26
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:30.624
<v Speaker 2>and that is pretty Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although possibly warranted every </v>

27
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 2>country on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single one has elements in it that</v>

28
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:37.494
<v Speaker 2>are good and that are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't mean that every country or </v>

29
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 2>every culture is equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously this is not the case,</v>

30
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.423
<v Speaker 2>but every country is made up of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of people with all sorts of </v>

31
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.264
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>

32
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 2>As I've said often on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate minorities,</v>

33
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 2>the individual judging an entire group </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a collective,</v>

34
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 2>we'll almost always assure you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismiss huge amounts of people who don't</v>

35
00:01:58.501 --> 00:01:59.334
<v Speaker 2>fit the stereotype or the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said this before and I'll say it </v>

36
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:02.754
<v Speaker 2>again and one of the things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>most proud of about the Ruben report is </v>

37
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.354
<v Speaker 2>that our audience is truly worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we did our fan shore a couple of </v>

38
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.403
<v Speaker 2>months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got messages from people in over 60 </v>

39
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:13.734
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We chose people based on their </v>

40
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.134
<v Speaker 2>individual attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because we expected them to </v>

41
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 2>represent an entire nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While our mainstream media does a pretty</v>

42
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 2>poor job of showing that we have more in</v>
<v Speaker 2>common than what separates us,</v>

43
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.443
<v Speaker 2>I find that people like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones watching this right now do an </v>

44
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:31.044
<v Speaker 2>incredibly good job of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The conversations I see you having in </v>

45
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:34.644
<v Speaker 2>the comments sections right here on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter and on facebook or even on your </v>

46
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 2>own youtube videos are connecting people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from all over the world.</v>

47
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.053
<v Speaker 2>I see you guys constantly trying to cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the nonsense and have real </v>

48
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:45.804
<v Speaker 2>conversations and find some common </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground together is the only way that </v>

49
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:50.604
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a chance to truly be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is Australian </v>

50
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:54.384
<v Speaker 2>journalist Rida Panahi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rita grew up in Iran in a Muslim family </v>

51
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>and emigrated to Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was six years old.</v>

52
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.983
<v Speaker 2>She's now a fierce defender of western </v>
<v Speaker 2>values and spends much of her time </v>

53
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 2>writing about the same issues I talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about on this show.</v>

54
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.883
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about her childhood </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Iran as well as her life in </v>

55
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:11.884
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there more to that giant island </v>

56
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>country than just boomerangs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos?</v>

57
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 2>I suspect there might just be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to prove my earlier point,</v>

58
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.573
<v Speaker 2>when was the last time you heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in the news about Australia </v>

59
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 2>since the terrorist attack in Sydney </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost two years ago.</v>

60
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 2>They had a nationwide election about two</v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago,</v>

61
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>but I think I only heard about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of a random link on twitter.</v>

62
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 2>If you're watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

63
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 2>you've already shared much of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream nonsense,</v>

64
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>but our work is still cut out for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep talking to interesting people</v>

65
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>from all over the world and if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got suggestions,</v>

66
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.204
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a comment section right down </v>

67
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.574
<v Speaker 2>below.</v>

68
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.453
<v Speaker 2>Rita Pinar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is a journalist who was born in </v>

70
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:56.554
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent her first year is in Iran and has </v>

71
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 2>lived in Australia ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rita,</v>

72
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 2>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

73
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greetings from Melbourne.</v>

74
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Greetings from Melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greetings from Los Angeles.</v>

75
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to dive into some Australia stuff</v>

76
00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:14.930
<v Speaker 2>cause we never hear anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia in America.</v>

77
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing since Crocodile Dundee </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

78
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.610
<v Speaker 2>We haven't heard anything from you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

79
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.550
<v Speaker 2>but let's start a little bit with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

80
00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Cause you have a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

81
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.900
<v Speaker 2>You were actually born in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

82
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:28.280
<v Speaker 2>but you never lived in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

83
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:29.114
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

84
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.541
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

86
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 3>I spent my first couple of years there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents were there,</v>

87
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.190
<v Speaker 3>my dad was studying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

88
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting his degree in Arkansas.</v>

89
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:39.510
<v Speaker 3>So I was born in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>down in pine bluff,</v>

90
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:40.344
<v Speaker 3>Arkansas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we moved back to the ranch was </v>

91
00:04:42.391 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 3>always the plan and then the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution happened.</v>

92
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 3>So things went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay shaped,</v>

93
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.253
<v Speaker 3>you ran quite quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're sort of a trap now in a </v>

94
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:55.140
<v Speaker 3>country that was entirely different to </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the revolution.</v>

95
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ended up in Australia.</v>

96
00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:00.810
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really grateful to be here really.</v>

97
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.753
<v Speaker 3>So it's a wonderful place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you guys think America is the </v>

98
00:05:05.281 --> 00:05:08.010
<v Speaker 3>center of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really think Australia is that the</v>

99
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:12.060
<v Speaker 3>lucky country as we call it and in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>body can do well in this country.</v>

100
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've heard you say that in speeches </v>

101
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:18.630
<v Speaker 2>before that you really think Australia </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the true place of tolerance and where</v>

102
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.780
<v Speaker 2>everyone can come and make a better life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that sort of stuff.</v>

103
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.450
<v Speaker 2>So your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they moved to,</v>

104
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.030
<v Speaker 2>to the states that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dad was teaching or something.</v>

105
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:27.864
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

106
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

107
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well when he was in the states,</v>

108
00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:30.674
<v Speaker 3>he was getting his degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he was at university and as soon as </v>

109
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.330
<v Speaker 3>he graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they moved back.</v>

110
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.970
<v Speaker 3>That was always the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

111
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when you ran,</v>

112
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.480
<v Speaker 3>went to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of the Islamic Revolution,</v>

113
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.733
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started looking at how they could </v>

114
00:05:47.631 --> 00:05:48.890
<v Speaker 3>get at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause uh,</v>

115
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.950
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

116
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.090
<v Speaker 3>will fairly persecuted there and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

117
00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:54.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it just wasn't safe.</v>

118
00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 3>When we had family members walked up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sending them in,</v>

119
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.943
<v Speaker 3>killed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really hell on earth for our </v>

120
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

121
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.523
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking to leave and the plan was </v>

122
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.160
<v Speaker 3>always to come back to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

123
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.590
<v Speaker 3>but my dad had a brother in Australia </v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

124
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 3>we ended up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the plan,</v>

125
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.090
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

126
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a lucky,</v>

127
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.743
<v Speaker 3>lucky chance.</v>

128
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't realize that before the </v>

129
00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Islamic revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a rod was a,</v>

130
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.840
<v Speaker 2>was a widely secular state and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

131
00:06:24.841 --> 00:06:25.674
<v Speaker 2>much more secular than it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you were really young when you </v>

132
00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:28.974
<v Speaker 2>were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are your memories from being </v>

133
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:31.620
<v Speaker 2>five or six years old?</v>

134
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Look out of the feeling limited </v>
<v Speaker 3>memories,</v>

135
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:35.320
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

136
00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the more western parts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Middle East.</v>

137
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at pictures of Tara and back in</v>

138
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.130
<v Speaker 3>before the revolution and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see women in miniskirts and I,</v>

139
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:50.770
<v Speaker 3>men and women mixing freely and women at</v>
<v Speaker 3>beaches.</v>

140
00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:51.604
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to live by the beach before </v>

141
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.790
<v Speaker 3>we're in Turan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

142
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.720
<v Speaker 3>and then things changed dramatically in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

143
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.563
<v Speaker 3>it really brings home just how quickly </v>
<v Speaker 3>things can degenerate into what we see </v>

144
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:05.601
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

145
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:06.434
<v Speaker 3>the rants progressed a little bit from </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the revolution first happened as </v>

146
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 3>far as its treatment of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still pretty bloody poor.</v>

147
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.631
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

148
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:14.464
<v Speaker 3>I remember having to go to school and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then suddenly going from being fairly </v>

149
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:22.270
<v Speaker 3>carefree and not having to cover my hair</v>
<v Speaker 3>to being in an age women at five,</v>

150
00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:23.560
<v Speaker 3>six years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

151
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a time where you had to wear </v>

152
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:26.620
<v Speaker 3>the hijab.</v>

153
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.620
<v Speaker 3>That was a requirement and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely dehumanizing and I just loved</v>

154
00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:33.594
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked that change even just in my </v>

155
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:40.351
<v Speaker 3>little life from when I was running </v>
<v Speaker 3>around with the boys and being a regular</v>

156
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:45.391
<v Speaker 3>kid to being expected to observe these </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral codes,</v>

157
00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:48.730
<v Speaker 3>like making sure my hair's covered and </v>
<v Speaker 3>behaving in a certain way.</v>

158
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so even that as a,</v>

159
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.570
<v Speaker 3>at a tender age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

160
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.120
<v Speaker 3>I felt the full force of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

161
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.300
<v Speaker 3>always knew I was an American citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

162
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I always identified as someone other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

163
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.533
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone had to live the rest of their </v>

164
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:08.350
<v Speaker 3>life under that oppressive system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

165
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:09.184
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was significant for me and I was </v>

166
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:11.824
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have one of the original anchor </v>

167
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

168
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:14.224
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get out one day when I made </v>

169
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.920
<v Speaker 3>team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to have to be here.</v>

170
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:20.530
<v Speaker 3>So that really was a source of comfort </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

171
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:25.531
<v Speaker 3>even as a very young child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one day I'd get out of this.</v>

172
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.843
<v Speaker 2>What a fascinating time to grow up </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not like people having </v>

173
00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:35.080
<v Speaker 2>their formative years when there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>change where you just were going through</v>

174
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.630
<v Speaker 2>what you had to go through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to go from,</v>

175
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:42.550
<v Speaker 2>even though you were very young to </v>
<v Speaker 2>having memories of freedom and that,</v>

176
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.360
<v Speaker 2>and then as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a five year old or whatever that you,</v>

177
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Speaker 2>you knew something was wrong with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>forced into that kind of system.</v>

178
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.060
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

179
00:08:51.061 --> 00:08:54.180
<v Speaker 3>and even now that keeps them sticking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the young girls,</v>

180
00:08:54.181 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first years,</v>

181
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:56.364
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to cover up and they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>run around and then they don't have </v>

182
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 3>these obligations on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when they start school,</v>

183
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 3>then the hijabs have to be worn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

184
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.870
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

185
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 3>know not the best things when you've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stinking hot day,</v>

186
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:13.030
<v Speaker 3>nevermind that the rest of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

187
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks my heart when I see that.</v>

188
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 3>When you see the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that girl's been tickled out having to,</v>

189
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.593
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transition from just being a kid and to </v>

190
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:26.971
<v Speaker 3>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

191
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 3>part of the regime.</v>

192
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it like to actually get out?</v>

193
00:09:31.121 --> 00:09:31.954
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said your dad had a brother in </v>

194
00:09:32.861 --> 00:09:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume the regime probably didn't want</v>

195
00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:38.500
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bright young people to leave.</v>

196
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.210
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we,</v>

197
00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:42.044
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were really lucky to be accepted in </v>

198
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom,</v>

199
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a midwife.</v>

200
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:47.244
<v Speaker 3>She was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was the head midwife at a hospital </v>

201
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:50.870
<v Speaker 3>there that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

202
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.170
<v Speaker 3>attended by the royal family before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamic Revolution.</v>

203
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.283
<v Speaker 3>So it was a lot of pictures of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing the role family around the </v>

204
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 3>facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

205
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 3>that was a fairly regular thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that come and visit and she'd be the one</v>

206
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 3>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a bit of a glamor,</v>

207
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:06.024
<v Speaker 3>glamor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paulson,</v>

208
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look the,</v>

209
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.403
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they really feared for their life </v>

210
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 3>because there were publications and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures of her with the royal family.</v>

211
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 3>And you think that might be a minor </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

212
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:18.510
<v Speaker 3>People got killed for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

213
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.340
<v Speaker 3>people we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

214
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:21.210
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got in prison.</v>

215
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

216
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 3>we were lucky to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

217
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.133
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intention wasn't to stay in </v>

218
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:26.994
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we ended up staying here and a were </v>

219
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 3>granted asylum and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

220
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

221
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:33.684
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

222
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 3>forever indebted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indebted to the country because of that,</v>

223
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:38.180
<v Speaker 3>because he gave us a chance at a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

224
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of culture shock was that?</v>

225
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Like a six year old going from Iran in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

226
00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 2>in the Middle East to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to an island,</v>

227
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.191
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

228
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in,</v>

229
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:49.480
<v Speaker 2>in Boardshorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

230
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be boarding and all that.</v>

231
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

232
00:10:52.971 --> 00:10:53.804
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the language was a shock too </v>

233
00:10:54.891 --> 00:10:55.970
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

234
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:56.923
<v Speaker 3>even though I was born in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had zero English because I'd been </v>

235
00:11:00.531 --> 00:11:03.080
<v Speaker 3>brought up in your end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had like two words,</v>

236
00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:04.340
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And T,</v>

237
00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:07.190
<v Speaker 3>which is a weird combination of woods </v>
<v Speaker 3>deny.</v>

238
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.980
<v Speaker 3>So I had to learn the language very </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>

239
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.053
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's such a welcoming place and </v>

240
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.240
<v Speaker 3>thankfully English is a very simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>language for a child to learn.</v>

241
00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:21.040
<v Speaker 3>So it only took a few months and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

242
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.110
<v Speaker 3>it is a bit of a culture shock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Australia is not that different that</v>

243
00:11:24.111 --> 00:11:26.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys imagine any guys think they,</v>

244
00:11:26.121 --> 00:11:28.400
<v Speaker 3>we never got Kangaroos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

245
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.040
<v Speaker 3>just a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

246
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.940
<v Speaker 2>I assume you have a boomerang within </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaching distance of you right now.</v>

247
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.301
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise,</v>

248
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:37.130
<v Speaker 3>I'd never leave home without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>boomerang.</v>

249
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.290
<v Speaker 3>You never know when you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

250
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.970
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

251
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.460
<v Speaker 3>it was a culture shock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

252
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:44.931
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you made,</v>

253
00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:48.530
<v Speaker 3>it really felt safe and very quickly you</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>

254
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:51.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a really welcoming,</v>

255
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

256
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 3>wonderful to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to grow up and so much opportunity.</v>

257
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

258
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.380
<v Speaker 2>did you experience any discrimination or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that or really was it just</v>

259
00:12:01.381 --> 00:12:02.970
<v Speaker 2>simply you were there</v>

260
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.750
<v Speaker 3>30 years and I've been here now for like</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 13 years so you know,</v>

261
00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:07.584
<v Speaker 3>I have seen um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasional discrimination but really it </v>

262
00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:14.400
<v Speaker 3>is minor and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been,</v>

263
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.683
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite often then the discrimination I </v>

264
00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:19.800
<v Speaker 3>say are from your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

265
00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:23.370
<v Speaker 3>your bloody social justice warriors as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to be the most tolerant,</v>

266
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open minded people in the world.</v>

267
00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:27.144
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't conform to their idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what a brown person should be saying </v>

268
00:12:30.961 --> 00:12:31.794
<v Speaker 3>and doing and thinking then that quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>often really vicious and beneath that </v>

269
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 3>seem to be near of goodness is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a bigot.</v>

270
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.923
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've seen that quite a lot on </v>

271
00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:43.284
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the most racism I've </v>

272
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.600
<v Speaker 3>ever faced has been on twitter from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the lunatic left.</v>

273
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because your,</v>

274
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.540
<v Speaker 2>because somehow you're a brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do identify as Muslim?</v>

275
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Do you consider yourself ex Muslim or do</v>
<v Speaker 2>you consider yourself Muslim?</v>

276
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Cool myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eggs,</v>

277
00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.953
<v Speaker 3>x moles on my family and was one like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ask them what's your religion next </v>

278
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:06.610
<v Speaker 3>time was lump and then very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very relaxed about it.</v>

279
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 3>They were Muslim in the way most </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australians are Christian.</v>

280
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.513
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as one big difference between Australia </v>

281
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:14.680
<v Speaker 3>and America where a lot less religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>than than you guys.</v>

282
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:16.780
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

283
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 3>but as early as I could remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>identified as atheist,</v>

284
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

285
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.023
<v Speaker 3>so for me there wasn't a real big </v>
<v Speaker 3>transition from being a Muslim to being </v>

286
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Speaker 3>an agnostic or an atheist because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>never was practicing,</v>

287
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:32.554
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think my parents had ever been </v>

288
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:34.190
<v Speaker 3>to a mosque.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

289
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.680
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly not me.</v>

290
00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:37.650
<v Speaker 3>So they're not at all devout.</v>

291
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.390
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the discrimination which you faced,</v>

292
00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:43.790
<v Speaker 2>what you're describing is very little </v>
<v Speaker 2>and mostly on twitter,</v>

293
00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:44.624
<v Speaker 2>which is not reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep trying to remind myself that </v>

294
00:13:46.611 --> 00:13:48.560
<v Speaker 2>twitter's not reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're getting,</v>

295
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:53.120
<v Speaker 2>you're getting the discrimination from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social justice crew because your not</v>

296
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.133
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not their type of brown person because </v>

297
00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:57.530
<v Speaker 2>you do speak your mind.</v>

298
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.433
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is extraordinary that these people </v>

299
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 3>who supposedly spend their lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting for the,</v>

300
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.000
<v Speaker 3>for the minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

301
00:14:08.001 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see as a pitcher,</v>

302
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:10.564
<v Speaker 3>you're pressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in countries like Australia and </v>

303
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.863
<v Speaker 3>when are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually speaks up and has their own </v>

304
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 3>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

305
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't conform to their world </v>
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>

306
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 3>They are absolutely appalling in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their response,</v>

307
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight out bigotry.</v>

308
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

309
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you were sitting rice or if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're from a minority group,</v>

310
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.240
<v Speaker 3>you should only vote a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

311
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:38.074
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think for yourself and decide for </v>

312
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:42.274
<v Speaker 3>yourself who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you're going to support or where </v>

313
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 3>you're going to stand on certain issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

314
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.110
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

315
00:14:48.111 --> 00:14:48.944
<v Speaker 3>but beneath that thin veneer of virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite often there's a really hateful </v>

316
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 3>bigot when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone is,</v>

317
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:55.934
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.903
<v Speaker 3>identifies as a social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've got no qualms or bad mocking </v>

319
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:00.974
<v Speaker 3>them day and night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think there are quite often hard </v>

320
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 3>people who deserve to be called out.</v>

321
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get a lot of crap for calling </v>

322
00:15:08.461 --> 00:15:09.660
<v Speaker 2>them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't stop you.</v>

323
00:15:09.661 --> 00:15:10.650
<v Speaker 2>But I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

324
00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:11.484
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's such a dim view of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have that we should all be </v>

325
00:15:13.951 --> 00:15:15.480
<v Speaker 2>viewed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This collective is space.</v>

326
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.433
<v Speaker 2>But before we go all in on that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me a little bit about Australia </v>

327
00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:20.783
<v Speaker 2>because boomerangs and Kangaroos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse coriolis effect in your toilet </v>

328
00:15:24.241 --> 00:15:25.074
<v Speaker 2>aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like nobody in the states knows </v>

329
00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:30.000
<v Speaker 2>anything about Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a big island.</v>

330
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.990
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much it.</v>

331
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our big island,</v>

332
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 3>most of the population lives along the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast love desert in the middle.</v>

333
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really modern,</v>

334
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a lot like the states,</v>

335
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.730
<v Speaker 3>except we're not really just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

336
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things we look at you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't sort of identify when we've</v>

337
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:53.021
<v Speaker 3>had a prime minister who was an atheist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had no issue with that at all.</v>

338
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:54.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a terrible prime minister,</v>

339
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 3>but not because she was an atheist.</v>

340
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.581
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

341
00:15:59.581 --> 00:16:01.770
<v Speaker 3>That had nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

342
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.890
<v Speaker 3>we've had a lot of prime minister's </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

343
00:16:04.891 --> 00:16:08.700
<v Speaker 3>We've had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a modern history of being really stable,</v>

344
00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:12.600
<v Speaker 3>particularly politically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the last six,</v>

345
00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:13.434
<v Speaker 3>seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we seem to just keep knifing our prime </v>

346
00:16:15.571 --> 00:16:18.510
<v Speaker 3>minister's was they getting elected and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then their own party nights them.</v>

347
00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:19.344
<v Speaker 3>And then we have another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of characterize the </v>

348
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.314
<v Speaker 3>politics in recent years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've got a conservative government </v>

349
00:16:24.691 --> 00:16:25.524
<v Speaker 3>at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but led by a man who many conservatives </v>

350
00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:30.480
<v Speaker 3>don't really see as a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a really interesting period.</v>

351
00:16:30.481 --> 00:16:32.860
<v Speaker 3>And he just hung on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

352
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of the conservative base </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned their party and went and voted</v>

353
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:40.050
<v Speaker 3>for minor parties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really interesting seeing what's</v>

354
00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:44.100
<v Speaker 3>happening around the world with you guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there does seem to be this,</v>

355
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uprising from,</v>

356
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:51.360
<v Speaker 3>from conservatives where they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually think that the major parties or</v>

357
00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:52.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the major,</v>

358
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment,</v>

359
00:16:54.271 --> 00:16:56.580
<v Speaker 3>I guess isn't really representing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>interests.</v>

360
00:16:56.581 --> 00:16:57.880
<v Speaker 3>And in Australia we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

361
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 3>a lot of minor parties and some of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe as far right,</v>

362
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of boats in the last election this</v>

363
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.900
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

364
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think Americans think that </v>

365
00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:09.990
<v Speaker 2>everybody is like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

366
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.000
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a two party system.</v>

367
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.013
<v Speaker 2>Even though I keep saying on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution never says anything </v>

368
00:17:16.081 --> 00:17:16.914
<v Speaker 2>about only having two parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the two parties have a </v>

369
00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:19.554
<v Speaker 2>strangle their system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys have a bunch of parties that </v>

370
00:17:21.451 --> 00:17:23.850
<v Speaker 2>sort of trade power and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

371
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just two parties on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

372
00:17:26.401 --> 00:17:27.234
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

373
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:27.961
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

374
00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:32.010
<v Speaker 3>we've got a labor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is your predominant left party.</v>

375
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.353
<v Speaker 3>We've got at the conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are liberal and national and they </v>

376
00:17:36.151 --> 00:17:36.984
<v Speaker 3>are in a coalition together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we've got a minor party called </v>

377
00:17:39.301 --> 00:17:42.270
<v Speaker 3>the grains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they like wanting 10 votes.</v>

378
00:17:42.271 --> 00:17:43.490
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

379
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.300
<v Speaker 3>in the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our Apple House,</v>

380
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.310
<v Speaker 3>they have to have a presence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this last election,</v>

381
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.010
<v Speaker 3>the minor from all we had facets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

382
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:53.844
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our senate isn't the absolute dog's </v>

383
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:55.824
<v Speaker 3>breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

384
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.693
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be fascinating to see how </v>

385
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 3>we can govern for the next few years </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you've got so many months,</v>

386
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:03.144
<v Speaker 3>so many minor parties that I have got </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own little objection objectives </v>

387
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.750
<v Speaker 3>and you wonder how they're going to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

388
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

389
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.020
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a gray and passed legislation.</v>

390
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:14.340
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

391
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do,</v>

392
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 3>we have a very different system to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a party based system.</v>

393
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:19.314
<v Speaker 3>We don't like for a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a Labor prime minister we've like </v>

394
00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 3>for our representative in our local </v>
<v Speaker 3>seat,</v>

395
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 3>so it's a little bit uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

396
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:27.924
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but though we don't directly both for </v>

397
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:30.984
<v Speaker 3>the prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever is leading them parties </v>

398
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:36.240
<v Speaker 3>significant obviously and know it has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair,</v>

399
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 3>fair deal to do with who gets elected.</v>

400
00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of,</v>

401
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:42.040
<v Speaker 2>there's benefits and drawbacks to both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

402
00:18:42.041 --> 00:18:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Because here,</v>

403
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:44.870
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

404
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>

405
00:18:46.101 --> 00:18:47.210
<v Speaker 3>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

406
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.620
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>

407
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.270
<v Speaker 3>particularly in the Senate when you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got so many different parties now he can</v>

408
00:18:53.271 --> 00:18:57.770
<v Speaker 3>have the vote diluted and our senate is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a really weird system.</v>

409
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Every single stage is entitled to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same number of senators.</v>

410
00:19:01.281 --> 00:19:04.640
<v Speaker 3>So you might have a very populous state </v>
<v Speaker 3>like New South Wales or Victoria,</v>

411
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.550
<v Speaker 3>but we get the same number of senators </v>
<v Speaker 3>as Tasmania,</v>

412
00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:07.971
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

413
00:19:07.971 --> 00:19:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a one vote,</v>

414
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.560
<v Speaker 3>one value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

415
00:19:14.561 --> 00:19:15.394
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

416
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.460
<v Speaker 3>it's mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

417
00:19:16.461 --> 00:19:17.294
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be very much for abolishing our </v>

418
00:19:18.921 --> 00:19:19.754
<v Speaker 3>Senate after the house because it's very</v>
<v Speaker 3>much obstructionist and </v>

419
00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:23.690
<v Speaker 3>unrepresentative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

420
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ain't going to happen anytime soon.</v>

421
00:19:26.511 --> 00:19:28.570
<v Speaker 3>It's an argument that's been made </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades and,</v>

422
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.170
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still there,</v>

423
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

424
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious it being an island,</v>

425
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being just a day,</v>

426
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.360
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you guys are so big </v>
<v Speaker 2>geographically and that you're an eye on</v>

427
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 2>how much of that actually plays into </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorta the national eat those because you</v>

428
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:43.494
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when we see what's going on with </v>

429
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 2>the European Union and borders and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff,</v>

430
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:49.650
<v Speaker 2>these are people that are landlocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>next to each other.</v>

431
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>borders and immigration are important,</v>

432
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:52.914
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you guys really have the advantage </v>

433
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 2>of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

434
00:19:57.031 --> 00:19:57.864
<v Speaker 2>it really is just that simple in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how much is that actually like </v>

435
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.260
<v Speaker 2>affect policies and the way people think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the rest of the world and all that</v>

436
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:05.094
<v Speaker 2>kinds of stuff?</v>

437
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got oceans and yeah,</v>

438
00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:12.290
<v Speaker 3>geographically we are blessed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart from a lot of that turmoil.</v>

439
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.490
<v Speaker 3>But those oceans didn't stop 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people coming here by boat.</v>

440
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.573
<v Speaker 3>And when Labor was in government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had a very strict border control </v>

441
00:20:21.351 --> 00:20:24.530
<v Speaker 3>system under the conservative government</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

442
00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:27.710
<v Speaker 3>of John Howard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when labour were elected,</v>

443
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.620
<v Speaker 3>they completely dismantled that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

444
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.460
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't in their thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought it was more humane to,</v>

445
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.623
<v Speaker 3>to be a little bit more tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that tolerance led to hundreds of </v>

446
00:20:40.341 --> 00:20:41.174
<v Speaker 3>people over 1200 people drowning when </v>
<v Speaker 3>our borders trying to come here from </v>

447
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.973
<v Speaker 3>places like Indonesia by boat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went Indonesians that travel from </v>

448
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:50.290
<v Speaker 3>typically the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

449
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.110
<v Speaker 3>So there are migrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

450
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.090
<v Speaker 2>it's actually from other countries that </v>
<v Speaker 2>use it.</v>

451
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.021
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

452
00:20:54.021 --> 00:20:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Typically economic migrants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

453
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there was some genuine refugees</v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst them,</v>

454
00:20:58.541 --> 00:20:59.374
<v Speaker 3>but the overwhelming majority you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe as economic migrants and even </v>

455
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 3>the Labor Party came to acknowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they started toughening up.</v>

456
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:08.680
<v Speaker 3>And right now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

457
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.573
<v Speaker 3>they say they back all the border </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection policies that the </v>

458
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.420
<v Speaker 3>conservative side have and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

459
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.303
<v Speaker 3>then they're not going to dismantle </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything because it led to enormous </v>

460
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:21.214
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the 1200 people be drowned </v>

461
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 3>trying to get here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women and children amongst them,</v>

462
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 3>but also all our detention centers </v>
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>

463
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:30.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have 50,000,</v>

464
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 3>we had 50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think even more than that in detention</v>

465
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:34.610
<v Speaker 3>centers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

466
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.443
<v Speaker 3>effectively locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And since we've managed to take regain </v>

467
00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:40.054
<v Speaker 3>control of our borders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those detention centers have emptied </v>

468
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:42.874
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not people drowning on the </v>

469
00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Speaker 3>border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

470
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.980
<v Speaker 3>and we still have a refugee program.</v>

471
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 3>We still have a humanitarian intake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact increased it.</v>

472
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.413
<v Speaker 3>But we select people who are waiting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>observing the rules because you know </v>

473
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:57.484
<v Speaker 3>what people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a period where people would </v>

474
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:01.870
<v Speaker 3>argue that there are no cues to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

475
00:22:01.871 --> 00:22:02.330
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

476
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.770
<v Speaker 3>these programs don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as we know they do exist and there's</v>

477
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 3>people floundering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting in camps,</v>

478
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who don't have the resources to hop on a</v>

479
00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:12.454
<v Speaker 3>plane to Indonesia and then pay a people</v>
<v Speaker 3>smuggler to come by boat to Australia </v>

480
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.490
<v Speaker 3>and then now priority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

481
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ab refugee and take I think is something</v>

482
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:24.100
<v Speaker 3>to really be really proud of because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very generous with that.</v>

483
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

484
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:26.704
<v Speaker 3>this isn't just simply porous borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a proper humanitarian program </v>

485
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:30.963
<v Speaker 3>where these people are brought here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they even housing healthcare education </v>

486
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:36.450
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>help to,</v>

487
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 3>to become integrated into society.</v>

488
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.050
<v Speaker 2>What Rita Rita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were supposed to be a cold</v>

489
00:22:41.051 --> 00:22:42.160
<v Speaker 2>hearted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heartless,</v>

490
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:45.700
<v Speaker 2>conservative who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants to close borders and all that.</v>

491
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:49.660
<v Speaker 2>But it sounds like you're actually okay </v>
<v Speaker 2>with immigration as you are an immigrant</v>

492
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just want,</v>

493
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you just want reasonable standards to</v>

494
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to go.</v>

495
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.943
<v Speaker 3>What would would this country </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly economically needs are </v>

496
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:00.604
<v Speaker 3>economic migrants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bring a great deal of wealth and </v>

497
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:04.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're an aging nation.</v>

498
00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:05.404
<v Speaker 3>We need people to who are working age </v>
<v Speaker 3>and come here and are productive and </v>

499
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 3>contribute well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our humanitarian intake,</v>

500
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:14.500
<v Speaker 3>we've got to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it costs us a lot of money,</v>

501
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:16.730
<v Speaker 3>but it is something I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

502
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 3>as a rich nation we're obliged to do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm proud of that.</v>

503
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:21.963
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean that it's a free for </v>

504
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:24.140
<v Speaker 3>all and whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

505
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.280
<v Speaker 3>I can just a break the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come here and come here first.</v>

506
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.443
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to be mindful of where those </v>

507
00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:33.190
<v Speaker 3>refugees are coming from because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>late,</v>

508
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.650
<v Speaker 3>there has been issues with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

509
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.203
<v Speaker 3>some not integrating as they should and </v>
<v Speaker 3>as immigrants decades before them have </v>

510
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:44.410
<v Speaker 3>integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

511
00:23:44.411 --> 00:23:45.244
<v Speaker 3>so there is lot of debate in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country about where should these </v>

512
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 3>refugees come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

513
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 3>where do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we prioritize?</v>

514
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Christians are being persecuted in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Middle East,</v>

515
00:23:55.881 --> 00:23:57.610
<v Speaker 3>he's eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

516
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 3>or do we not consider religion at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just bring in whoever's,</v>

517
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:02.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

518
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neediest.</v>

519
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a poll just this week that was</v>

520
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 3>published.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those absolutely blown people away.</v>

521
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.220
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a poll that was uh,</v>

522
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by one of the more left leaning </v>

523
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 3>pollsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

524
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.700
<v Speaker 3>there can be no sort of accusations and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

525
00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:19.534
<v Speaker 3>it was published in the Guardian says it</v>
<v Speaker 3>came in accusations of this was some </v>

526
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:26.690
<v Speaker 3>sort of a rogue pole too to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change public sentiment.</v>

527
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.703
<v Speaker 3>But he showed one in two Australians </v>
<v Speaker 3>supports an immediate ban on Muslim </v>

528
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:33.620
<v Speaker 3>migration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is absolutely shocked.</v>

529
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 3>So many people who just refuse to accept</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this sort of sentiment is out there</v>

530
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:42.230
<v Speaker 3>and it's there because people don't talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this issue.</v>

531
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:43.350
<v Speaker 3>People pretend that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

532
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.070
<v Speaker 3>terrorism isn't happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it doesn't have a religion.</v>

533
00:24:46.071 --> 00:24:47.210
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

534
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.980
<v Speaker 3>most Australians are smarter than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

535
00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't actually agree with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediate ban on Muslim,</v>

536
00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:53.510
<v Speaker 3>on migration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not for that at all.</v>

537
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.373
<v Speaker 3>But I can understand and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the pole didn't surprise me because </v>

538
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:58.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think exist in this little tiny </v>

539
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:00.434
<v Speaker 3>echo chamber that so many of the media </v>
<v Speaker 3>seem to existing where I just think we </v>

540
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:09.620
<v Speaker 3>need to talk about these things openly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause when you don't,</v>

541
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 3>that's when you have sent them in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This rising,</v>

542
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think it's particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>

543
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.063
<v Speaker 2>So isn't that the ultimate irony of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your position for you particularly </v>

544
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 2>because as an immigrant from the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>East,</v>

545
00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:23.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's extremely personal to you.</v>

546
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.943
<v Speaker 2>But for me and the people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our space that we see on twitter that </v>

547
00:25:27.561 --> 00:25:28.394
<v Speaker 2>are talking about this stuff that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it from a bigoted place that want </v>

548
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:32.864
<v Speaker 2>to help people when we can and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also what a proper bedding they've </v>

549
00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:39.350
<v Speaker 2>put us in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a really bizarre situation.</v>

550
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.363
<v Speaker 2>And for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've seen you go on tv and I saw </v>

551
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:44.144
<v Speaker 2>something where you are on tv debating </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy and I anchor and he kept </v>

552
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:50.960
<v Speaker 2>implying you were saying all Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly.</v>

553
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:51.993
<v Speaker 2>Even even though you never said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we'll link to it below so people </v>

554
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:55.960
<v Speaker 2>can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never said it.</v>

555
00:25:55.961 --> 00:25:58.250
<v Speaker 2>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the age old argument that we have</v>

556
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:00.170
<v Speaker 2>all the time here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

557
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.900
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's from the Middle East.</v>

558
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.770
<v Speaker 2>She was born to Muslim parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She immigrated properly.</v>

559
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:07.604
<v Speaker 2>Now she's trying to stand up for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very values that this country is four </v>

560
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.250
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing this to you too.</v>

561
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.543
<v Speaker 3>This bizarro alliance between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>regressive left and Islamist is </v>

562
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.210
<v Speaker 3>prevalent every way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

563
00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:24.044
<v Speaker 3>in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the US and even in Australia and it is </v>

564
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:28.700
<v Speaker 3>bloody seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

565
00:26:28.701 --> 00:26:32.360
<v Speaker 3>The only sense it makes is that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>share a common enemy conservatives.</v>

566
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.860
<v Speaker 3>But I think you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

567
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.540
<v Speaker 3>appearance on morning television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had written a piece about,</v>

568
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this terror has an,</v>

569
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.380
<v Speaker 3>has a religion and we've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge it.</v>

570
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at pains as we always are.</v>

571
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say I'm talking about is limits until</v>

572
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 3>a little bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The extremist,</v>

573
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:55.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about that in time was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the long,</v>

574
00:26:55.191 --> 00:26:57.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those qualifications were made,</v>

575
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nevertheless,</v>

576
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even just talking about it,</v>

577
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:01.374
<v Speaker 3>Ebony and identifying what is happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is clear to anybody who hasn't got </v>

578
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:08.420
<v Speaker 3>their head buried in the sand was a pour</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this dude.</v>

579
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.330
<v Speaker 3>And he brought up Christian terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

580
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.180
<v Speaker 3>bombings at abortion clinics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think,</v>

581
00:27:15.181 --> 00:27:16.014
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last one was that he could find was </v>

582
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:18.960
<v Speaker 3>about 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago.</v>

583
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:20.480
<v Speaker 3>But nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

584
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:25.490
<v Speaker 3>you can't talk about Muslim based or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam as space terror without mentioning</v>

585
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.440
<v Speaker 3>the Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

586
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:29.274
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

587
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.113
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty great because you asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>him when the last one was and he had no </v>

588
00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:37.680
<v Speaker 2>idea that he busted out his phone in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few minutes later,</v>

589
00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:39.960
<v Speaker 2>came back and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out to be 15 or 20 years ago.</v>

590
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

591
00:27:41.371 --> 00:27:42.204
<v Speaker 2>because you guys haven't been hit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism really until about two years </v>

592
00:27:46.861 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 2>ago in Sydney and there was that hostage</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and all that was,</v>

593
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 2>how much did that actually change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion for you guys because you were</v>

594
00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:57.400
<v Speaker 2>seeing it everywhere else again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by water,</v>

595
00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.570
<v Speaker 2>seemingly safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

596
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.950
<v Speaker 2>did that really change the discussion in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country?</v>

597
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:03.963
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the Lindt cafe siege in Sydney and </v>

598
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.010
<v Speaker 3>there's been other events?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just a short time before that,</v>

599
00:28:12.011 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a young kitten,</v>

600
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Melvin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was radicalized and,</v>

601
00:28:16.991 --> 00:28:17.824
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tried to kill a couple of police </v>

602
00:28:19.061 --> 00:28:21.580
<v Speaker 3>officers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabbed and repeatedly he was shot dead.</v>

603
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.860
<v Speaker 3>That was probably our first taste of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

604
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.380
<v Speaker 3>linked effected the public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just targeted at police,</v>

605
00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.050
<v Speaker 3>but we've been really fortunate in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

606
00:28:32.051 --> 00:28:34.960
<v Speaker 3>We've had our counter terrorism offices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

607
00:28:34.961 --> 00:28:39.040
<v Speaker 3>and authorities foil several plots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've just had some,</v>

608
00:28:39.041 --> 00:28:39.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

609
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.550
<v Speaker 3>someone in prison for what was a called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Anzac Day,</v>

610
00:28:42.551 --> 00:28:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Tara Palantir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really significant date within our,</v>

611
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.443
<v Speaker 3>within our calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the plot plot there was to run over a </v>

612
00:28:48.611 --> 00:28:50.560
<v Speaker 3>police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>behead them,</v>

613
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 3>take their gun and shoot more people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

614
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.590
<v Speaker 3>we've had a mother's Day plot that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>with before the courts now,</v>

615
00:28:59.591 --> 00:29:01.000
<v Speaker 3>which was again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

616
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be tired in the public from the</v>

617
00:29:03.761 --> 00:29:05.230
<v Speaker 3>information that's out there.</v>

618
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.610
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been,</v>

619
00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.181
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

620
00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:10.060
<v Speaker 3>and the biggest one we had was all about</v>
<v Speaker 3>a decade ago,</v>

621
00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:11.270
<v Speaker 3>if not longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

622
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a decade ago,</v>

623
00:29:12.401 --> 00:29:17.350
<v Speaker 3>which was a quite advanced plans to bomb</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Melbourne cricket ground,</v>

624
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.780
<v Speaker 3>which is our biggest sporting stadium </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

625
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.580
<v Speaker 3>So we've been really fortunate that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these plots have been,</v>

626
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped in their tracks.</v>

627
00:29:27.251 --> 00:29:30.040
<v Speaker 3>But those lone wolf attacks as we call </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

628
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.010
<v Speaker 3>they're not so easily stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

629
00:29:33.011 --> 00:29:33.844
<v Speaker 3>and it has been a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a police member shot in Sydney </v>

630
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.310
<v Speaker 3>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

631
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 3>in an attack by a young kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 15,</v>

632
00:29:41.891 --> 00:29:43.060
<v Speaker 3>16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was again,</v>

633
00:29:43.061 --> 00:29:46.090
<v Speaker 3>radicalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've had a taste of it,</v>

634
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 3>but no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

635
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.633
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places like France and Belgium where </v>

636
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.033
<v Speaker 3>there issues seem to be so advanced that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to have they ever going to get </v>

637
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:55.080
<v Speaker 3>on top of it.</v>

638
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the irony too is that it's like </v>

639
00:29:57.571 --> 00:30:00.300
<v Speaker 2>the better that our security services </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

640
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.343
<v Speaker 2>the more things that they stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And often we don't know that they </v>

641
00:30:03.991 --> 00:30:06.630
<v Speaker 2>stopped them until sometimes months or </v>
<v Speaker 2>years later.</v>

642
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.570
<v Speaker 2>And then at the same time it makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat seem lower.</v>

643
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.440
<v Speaker 2>So then people want to be more tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

644
00:30:13.441 --> 00:30:15.760
<v Speaker 2>tolerance basically is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

645
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have a full picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess that's really what the,</v>

646
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:19.710
<v Speaker 2>the big issue is</v>

647
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.720
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can become complacent.</v>

648
00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:25.080
<v Speaker 3>I know we don't live in fear here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't think you know,</v>

649
00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:27.460
<v Speaker 3>over what was going to be blowing off </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the street corner.</v>

650
00:30:27.461 --> 00:30:28.294
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've just got to be awake to the </v>

651
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:31.594
<v Speaker 3>reality of what's happening around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and that we are not immune from </v>

652
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:35.011
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

653
00:30:35.011 --> 00:30:35.844
<v Speaker 3>the terror denies around here we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring up things like what you got much </v>

654
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:39.170
<v Speaker 3>more chance of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

655
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.410
<v Speaker 3>dying in a car crash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

656
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bloody do you know,</v>

657
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.850
<v Speaker 3>we drive around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got millions of cars but you know,</v>

658
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:46.684
<v Speaker 3>do we not think about terror and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about that and make sure we </v>

659
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:53.490
<v Speaker 3>kept doing things to counter it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

660
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:54.723
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we not worry about domestic violence </v>

661
00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 3>because more people are dying on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>roads from car accidents.</v>

662
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is just a stupid argument.</v>

663
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.910
<v Speaker 3>There is just so much that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually dishonest and,</v>

664
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.023
<v Speaker 3>and just fraudulent in my mind when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to this space because people will </v>

665
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.383
<v Speaker 3>do anything not to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will do anything to deny that </v>

666
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:16.564
<v Speaker 3>it's even an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it obviously is an issue on this </v>

667
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:19.954
<v Speaker 3>poll that came out this week show is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is an issue and people are </v>

668
00:31:23.851 --> 00:31:24.684
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if our elite median politicians </v>

669
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.030
<v Speaker 3>aren't willing to discuss it.</v>

670
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you think of anything else that were</v>

671
00:31:32.551 --> 00:31:33.384
<v Speaker 2>so paralyzed to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I really can't in 2016 is there </v>

672
00:31:37.441 --> 00:31:38.274
<v Speaker 2>anything else that we treat with such </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid gloves that is of such importance </v>

673
00:31:42.841 --> 00:31:43.674
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I get email from people literally </v>

674
00:31:45.421 --> 00:31:46.254
<v Speaker 2>all over the world from almost every </v>
<v Speaker 2>country saying that their governments </v>

675
00:31:48.691 --> 00:31:49.920
<v Speaker 2>are doing the exact same thing.</v>

676
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to,</v>

677
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Be.</v>

678
00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Every western nation seems to be dealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it in Australia.</v>

679
00:31:57.381 --> 00:31:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I think the other issue that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be to do,</v>

680
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.723
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is a significant issue is what's </v>

681
00:32:02.841 --> 00:32:05.390
<v Speaker 3>happening in a lot of indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities.</v>

682
00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.253
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that people don't talk </v>

683
00:32:08.121 --> 00:32:08.954
<v Speaker 3>about because if you do talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he can get labeled a racist very </v>

684
00:32:12.441 --> 00:32:13.274
<v Speaker 3>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you care enough to want to </v>

685
00:32:16.281 --> 00:32:18.450
<v Speaker 3>actually do something about an attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lease,</v>

686
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.440
<v Speaker 3>put it on the public to public or </v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss it.</v>

687
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Even we've got kids who are being really</v>
<v Speaker 3>mistreated,</v>

688
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.270
<v Speaker 3>neglected,</v>

689
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.310
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

690
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.250
<v Speaker 3>And they're not being saved by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>authorities.</v>

691
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:35.200
<v Speaker 3>They're not being taken into care at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same level as you would expect.</v>

692
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

693
00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:38.260
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me rephrase that.</v>

694
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.300
<v Speaker 3>They actually are taking in to care at </v>
<v Speaker 3>greater rates then,</v>

695
00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.453
<v Speaker 3>then the non indigenous community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the point where the authorities </v>

696
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:49.050
<v Speaker 3>typed them seems to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

697
00:32:49.051 --> 00:32:51.370
<v Speaker 3>a lot higher than then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

698
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 3>no white kid I don't think would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to be mistreated in that way for</v>

699
00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:58.870
<v Speaker 3>so long before they are saved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

700
00:32:58.871 --> 00:33:03.871
<v Speaker 3>we've got this nurse stolen generation </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative in our history that,</v>

701
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:09.560
<v Speaker 3>that the authorities are scared now to </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually save kids who are being abused.</v>

702
00:33:09.561 --> 00:33:10.394
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because of that political </v>

703
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:12.644
<v Speaker 3>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't want to create </v>

704
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:15.194
<v Speaker 3>another stolen generation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>indigenous kids taken from their </v>

705
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:18.854
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those kids are condemned to just </v>

706
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:23.120
<v Speaker 3>terrible lives.</v>

707
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

708
00:33:23.761 --> 00:33:24.240
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

709
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 3>they repeat the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

710
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.303
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's just such a great </v>

711
00:33:28.461 --> 00:33:31.920
<v Speaker 3>shame and there is that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really significant gap in,</v>

712
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.660
<v Speaker 3>in living standards in life expectancy </v>
<v Speaker 3>in outcomes.</v>

713
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:36.703
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you in this community compared to </v>

714
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:38.684
<v Speaker 3>the non indigenous community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I believe a great deal of that has </v>

715
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:42.644
<v Speaker 3>to do with these politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies where we can't talk about </v>

716
00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 3>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't talk about the rampant abuse,</v>

717
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.930
<v Speaker 3>sexual abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't talk about the alcoholism,</v>

718
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:58.780
<v Speaker 3>the drug use because to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to even start discussing it is,</v>

719
00:33:58.781 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is racist.</v>

720
00:33:59.841 --> 00:34:00.674
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arguments will come up with what </v>

721
00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:05.390
<v Speaker 3>about all the drug use and alcoholism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the non indigenous community?</v>

722
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.733
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

723
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't stop.</v>

724
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the same sort of phenomenon</v>

725
00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:14.684
<v Speaker 3>happening there and it's just as </v>
<v Speaker 3>destructive and it actually hurts the </v>

726
00:34:17.331 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 3>people that they're trying to protect </v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

727
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.040
<v Speaker 3>from discussion.</v>

728
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we see that,</v>

729
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:27.380
<v Speaker 2>we see that exact same thing when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to the discussion on Islam because</v>

730
00:34:27.381 --> 00:34:29.780
<v Speaker 2>if we don't talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then who are you hurting the most?</v>

731
00:34:29.781 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 2>You're actually hurting Muslim people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are living under these theocracies</v>

732
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.703
<v Speaker 3>killed the most and oppress the most are</v>
<v Speaker 3>other Muslims and Islamic state and </v>

733
00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 3>looks at Shiite Muslims like my family </v>
<v Speaker 3>as infidels.</v>

734
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:53.120
<v Speaker 3>No different from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Jews or a nonbelievers gays,</v>

735
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

736
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.780
<v Speaker 3>they think they're deserving of nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>other than death as well.</v>

737
00:34:56.781 --> 00:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

738
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:02.510
<v Speaker 3>and extremist Islam as have been killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>other Muslims,</v>

739
00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a rate that is extraordinary for </v>

740
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:06.044
<v Speaker 3>decades and we just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost not on our radar anymore </v>

741
00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:10.520
<v Speaker 3>because it happens so often</v>

742
00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.780
<v Speaker 2>about the abortion bombing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Crusades.</v>

743
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

744
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even google.</v>

745
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the Crusades?</v>

746
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God's sake,</v>

747
00:35:18.451 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 3>some of the arguments that are thrown up</v>
<v Speaker 3>are just,</v>

748
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.423
<v Speaker 3>they're just too stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you've got to acknowledge them when </v>

749
00:35:25.201 --> 00:35:29.130
<v Speaker 3>you've got to counter them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're being taught in universities.</v>

750
00:35:29.131 --> 00:35:29.964
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had these sort of arguments with </v>

751
00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 3>university lecturers and journalists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

752
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:35.474
<v Speaker 3>pay academics who are on public purse </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just spewing forth bullshit and </v>

753
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 3>it's maddening.</v>

754
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Spewing forth bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be the title of a,</v>

755
00:35:46.431 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 2>of a book that we should probably call </v>
<v Speaker 2>write that book.</v>

756
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.433
<v Speaker 2>So jumping back for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about Australia's role in the </v>

757
00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:52.734
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the Australian sort of ethos </v>

758
00:35:55.801 --> 00:35:56.634
<v Speaker 2>about what you feel your role should be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you guys aren't that </v>

759
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:01.014
<v Speaker 2>interventionists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've been part of coalitions and </v>

760
00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

761
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 2>the feeling there of what your purpose </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world should be?</v>

762
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty laid back about things.</v>

763
00:36:12.051 --> 00:36:14.150
<v Speaker 3>We don't try to sort of sit the agenda </v>
<v Speaker 3>agender or,</v>

764
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

765
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.910
<v Speaker 3>in four our belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we have been a good corporates.</v>

766
00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:22.490
<v Speaker 3>The corporates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been global citizen.</v>

767
00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:23.653
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

768
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Slip is going to be replayed many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

769
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

770
00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:30.791
<v Speaker 3>we will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

771
00:36:30.791 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

772
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can be quite proud of,</v>

773
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

774
00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.660
<v Speaker 3>involvement in World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our involvement,</v>

775
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

776
00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the allied forces.</v>

777
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.540
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

778
00:36:43.541 --> 00:36:45.970
<v Speaker 3>we do feel a little bit removed </v>
<v Speaker 3>geographically.</v>

779
00:36:45.971 --> 00:36:49.090
<v Speaker 3>We are so far from so much of what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening around the world,</v>

780
00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.920
<v Speaker 3>but these days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

781
00:36:50.921 --> 00:36:53.770
<v Speaker 3>it's all there in your hand and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and it's,</v>

782
00:36:53.771 --> 00:36:54.221
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

783
00:36:54.221 --> 00:36:55.180
<v Speaker 3>it's immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

784
00:36:55.181 --> 00:36:58.220
<v Speaker 3>what's happening as soon as it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

785
00:36:58.221 --> 00:36:58.740
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

786
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

787
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.110
<v Speaker 3>we are living in a time where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

788
00:37:02.111 --> 00:37:02.944
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those borders don't seem to mean as </v>

789
00:37:05.171 --> 00:37:06.700
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>

790
00:37:06.701 --> 00:37:09.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're feeling relaxed about our place in</v>

791
00:37:09.311 --> 00:37:10.150
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

792
00:37:10.151 --> 00:37:11.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we do have those amongst us,</v>

793
00:37:11.831 --> 00:37:16.480
<v Speaker 3>as you have been Erie community who </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to set the agenda,</v>

794
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.620
<v Speaker 3>they want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

795
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a carbon tax for a while and,</v>

796
00:37:20.411 --> 00:37:21.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rationale was there.</v>

797
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.710
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

798
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:26.320
<v Speaker 3>we got to lead the world in an emission </v>
<v Speaker 3>trading scheme.</v>

799
00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:31.060
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be the standard bearers </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a fighting global warming.</v>

800
00:37:31.061 --> 00:37:31.570
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

801
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.250
<v Speaker 3>the government got thrown out really </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly,</v>

802
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:37.030
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't last too long.</v>

803
00:37:37.031 --> 00:37:42.031
<v Speaker 3>So I think overall it's Australians </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize a pretty lucky,</v>

804
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:47.080
<v Speaker 3>we got a very good standard of living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got our own concerns.</v>

805
00:37:47.081 --> 00:37:47.914
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of issues from housing </v>

806
00:37:49.571 --> 00:37:54.300
<v Speaker 3>affordability to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the threat of terror.</v>

807
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

808
00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.491
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

809
00:37:57.491 --> 00:37:58.660
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty happy with</v>

810
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.660
<v Speaker 3>saying what's happening around the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

811
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.513
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and feeling fortunate that it's not </v>

812
00:38:05.361 --> 00:38:07.010
<v Speaker 3>happening in our back yard yet.</v>

813
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

814
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you it's that water thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>being big and surrounded by water.</v>

815
00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty good.</v>

816
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do,</v>

817
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of our crazy election </v>
<v Speaker 2>here at Natalie?</v>

818
00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.053
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what kind of coverage in Australia </v>

819
00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:24.650
<v Speaker 2>just in mainstream media is our election</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting?</v>

820
00:38:24.651 --> 00:38:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all we have here.</v>

821
00:38:26.241 --> 00:38:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Any of the Cable News,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 hour days,</v>

822
00:38:28.101 --> 00:38:29.210
<v Speaker 2>that's all we talk about.</v>

823
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

824
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Are we getting a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot more than previously?</v>

825
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:38.991
<v Speaker 3>There is a lot of American election </v>
<v Speaker 3>coverage in our mainstream news,</v>

826
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 3>that particular television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great deal of it and all of it.</v>

827
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of it is pretty much what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd expect.</v>

828
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:47.170
<v Speaker 3>It's very much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

829
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:51.370
<v Speaker 3>trump is this maniac who's a racist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist.</v>

830
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the reports I've seen,</v>

831
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.440
<v Speaker 3>she's wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just straight.</v>

832
00:38:55.441 --> 00:38:57.950
<v Speaker 3>And news reports have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

833
00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.400
<v Speaker 3>an extraordinary in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in being little,</v>

834
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:04.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>editorials that are absolutely biased.</v>

835
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>

836
00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>

837
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a great deal of thoughts.</v>

838
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fan of either candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

839
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it's easy astic for </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

840
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:17.830
<v Speaker 3>but I completely understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

841
00:39:17.831 --> 00:39:22.831
<v Speaker 3>I understand people being utterly fed up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wanting an antiestablishment figure.</v>

842
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know why he appeals to people.</v>

843
00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:27.274
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of things that the media </v>
<v Speaker 3>sees gaps and sees huge errors in his </v>

844
00:39:32.351 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

845
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:36.880
<v Speaker 3>I actually enormous assets and a of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>appealed to a lot of people.</v>

846
00:39:36.881 --> 00:39:38.220
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

847
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.423
<v Speaker 3>it's been just fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to be there for the last </v>

848
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 3>month or two and just say had on phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

849
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:46.871
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

850
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:48.730
<v Speaker 3>some of his greatest enemies are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

851
00:39:48.731 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 3>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assess it.</v>

852
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:52.260
<v Speaker 3>So you look at what's happening now with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the protests in,</v>

853
00:39:52.261 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 3>in Charlotte and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

854
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.093
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the protests that were happening at </v>

855
00:39:56.541 --> 00:39:57.374
<v Speaker 3>Israelis and you think the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>American looking at that would actually </v>

856
00:40:02.561 --> 00:40:03.394
<v Speaker 3>sympathize with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would simply would understand some of </v>

857
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 3>the things he's been saying about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country has turned into.</v>

858
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

859
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.333
<v Speaker 3>Charlotte is just extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a black cop shooting and </v>

860
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.233
<v Speaker 3>seems to be an arm of black men and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>places being torn apart and our black </v>

861
00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:21.960
<v Speaker 3>protestors showed another black protests</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

862
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.223
<v Speaker 3>But it's</v>

863
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.990
<v Speaker 2>in a city with a democratic mayor.</v>

864
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

865
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:29.870
<v Speaker 3>but it is why she's fault somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

866
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:30.893
<v Speaker 3>this black on black violence that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened as somehow a course for just </v>

867
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.693
<v Speaker 3>lutie and beatings and just a mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindless violence that's been </v>

868
00:40:41.201 --> 00:40:46.201
<v Speaker 3>characterized as some sort of a protest </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's got some purpose and it doesn't,</v>

869
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Speaker 3>it is just mindless looting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

870
00:40:50.021 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 3>And it should be called and what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

871
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.243
<v Speaker 3>I think the public can see what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the media narrative is trying to </v>

872
00:40:58.121 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 3>paint it as something other than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that is a great,</v>

873
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:02.183
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is something else we have in </v>

874
00:41:03.161 --> 00:41:03.994
<v Speaker 3>common in Australia and America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe is the media being out of touch </v>

875
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:14.230
<v Speaker 3>with its readers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>viewers,</v>

876
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.140
<v Speaker 3>listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just increasingly,</v>

877
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:22.141
<v Speaker 3>there's a gap between members of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>media and the mainstream population.</v>

878
00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's not healthy.</v>

879
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:25.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting that you used </v>

880
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:27.034
<v Speaker 2>the phrase out of touch because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the debates were constantly </v>

881
00:41:29.441 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Speaker 2>having here and the reason that online </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows are working is that it's it,</v>

882
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 2>is it out of touch or is it that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually in it with the politicians?</v>

883
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:38.864
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a sort of generational thing </v>

884
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:43.430
<v Speaker 2>and just the technology thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

885
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:44.264
<v Speaker 2>we're all walking around with phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we're all on the ground </v>

886
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:46.723
<v Speaker 2>journalists or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is it that they're actually in it </v>

887
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:50.264
<v Speaker 2>with the people in power so they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vested interest in keeping that game </v>

888
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 2>going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe both?</v>

889
00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Well in the U S in might be a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

890
00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:01.890
<v Speaker 3>In Australia I think it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because they're part of the</v>

891
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:02.843
<v Speaker 3>establishment or the elite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just the ideological </v>

892
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.770
<v Speaker 3>disposition of a great number of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>members of the media and it's,</v>

893
00:42:10.771 --> 00:42:13.590
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite many of them,</v>

894
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

895
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:16.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

896
00:42:16.171 --> 00:42:18.030
<v Speaker 3>then look at the mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

897
00:42:18.031 --> 00:42:20.130
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't acknowledge the mainstream is</v>

898
00:42:20.131 --> 00:42:21.240
<v Speaker 3>actually mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

899
00:42:21.241 --> 00:42:22.074
<v Speaker 3>they think quite often things because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're surrounded by likeminded people </v>

900
00:42:24.451 --> 00:42:26.820
<v Speaker 3>that their views or the prep one's views</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're not,</v>

901
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:29.410
<v Speaker 3>or they just look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

902
00:42:29.411 --> 00:42:34.020
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream with this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>condemnation as if they're too stupid to</v>

903
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:36.720
<v Speaker 3>believe what they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

904
00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.340
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

905
00:42:38.341 --> 00:42:41.100
<v Speaker 3>really unhealthy at a time where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream media needs,</v>

906
00:42:41.101 --> 00:42:45.930
<v Speaker 3>it needs its audience more than ever to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be poles apart from,</v>

907
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.500
<v Speaker 3>from what the great majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population thinks,</v>

908
00:42:49.501 --> 00:42:52.470
<v Speaker 3>I think is really unfortunate.</v>

909
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

910
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Australia anyway,</v>

911
00:42:54.251 --> 00:42:55.084
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a simple matter of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics of the individuals within the </v>

912
00:42:58.471 --> 00:42:59.304
<v Speaker 3>media tends to be very much on the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>as it has in your been for the </v>

913
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.200
<v Speaker 3>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

914
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:07.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

915
00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.380
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the population is a lot more</v>

916
00:43:10.381 --> 00:43:13.560
<v Speaker 3>diverse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot more nuanced than that.</v>

917
00:43:13.561 --> 00:43:14.394
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

918
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:15.893
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

919
00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.180
<v Speaker 3>and they've used aren't being properly </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflected.</v>

920
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.093
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

921
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.973
<v Speaker 3>of course there are conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>commentators and writers and </v>

922
00:43:21.601 --> 00:43:22.434
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but very much in the minority and not </v>

923
00:43:24.961 --> 00:43:28.630
<v Speaker 3>reflecting the number of voters who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

924
00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 3>leaning that way.</v>

925
00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:31.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of this stuff do you think is </v>

926
00:43:32.281 --> 00:43:35.670
<v Speaker 2>actually just purely the fault of </v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

927
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.520
<v Speaker 2>be it in Australia or be it here or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever?</v>

928
00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching the,</v>

929
00:43:39.731 --> 00:43:41.220
<v Speaker 2>the Charlotte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

930
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.370
<v Speaker 2>the riot and there was this guy and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>found a protest or,</v>

931
00:43:44.371 --> 00:43:48.510
<v Speaker 2>and he was screaming about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll preface this with saying,</v>

932
00:43:48.511 --> 00:43:51.830
<v Speaker 2>this is not a defense of trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trump is not empower.</v>

933
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:52.763
<v Speaker 2>Now he's not the president or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor of the state or the mayor of </v>

934
00:43:55.231 --> 00:43:57.750
<v Speaker 2>that city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was blaming trump.</v>

935
00:43:57.751 --> 00:43:58.584
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you should be blaming </v>

936
00:43:59.521 --> 00:44:00.354
<v Speaker 2>Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not even saying you should be </v>

937
00:44:01.621 --> 00:44:03.420
<v Speaker 2>blaming Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

938
00:44:03.421 --> 00:44:08.421
<v Speaker 2>you're misdirecting things at somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has literally nothing to do.</v>

939
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.480
<v Speaker 2>No power in place has anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with trump right now.</v>

940
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.820
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an education problem,</v>

941
00:44:14.821 --> 00:44:17.340
<v Speaker 2>not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a political problem.</v>

942
00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a Yay.</v>

943
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.650
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those opinions come from ignorance,</v>

944
00:44:23.651 --> 00:44:27.430
<v Speaker 3>but they are supported again by quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>often by mainstream media.</v>

945
00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:28.661
<v Speaker 3>Now I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

946
00:44:28.661 --> 00:44:29.494
<v Speaker 3>after even Orlando there was talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump as if he had anything to do with </v>

947
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:36.294
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Alando massive gain is just absurd </v>

948
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.563
<v Speaker 3>to be blaming him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You imagine how this news would be </v>

949
00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:44.754
<v Speaker 3>reported if it was a bunch of trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters were tearing apart a city </v>

950
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.860
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

951
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:51.203
<v Speaker 3>bashing by standards or just the color </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this game who were looting and that </v>

952
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.670
<v Speaker 3>and just causing this widespread </v>
<v Speaker 3>widespread mayhem and destruction.</v>

953
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

954
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.320
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is completely idiotic.</v>

955
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:06.330
<v Speaker 3>But it's become almost a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

956
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:09.000
<v Speaker 3>and whenever something horrible happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world,</v>

957
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be blame brexit.</v>

958
00:45:10.621 --> 00:45:13.170
<v Speaker 3>You blame trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you blame the crusades.</v>

959
00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:14.004
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't ever actually pin point the </v>

960
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 3>blame at the people responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause that would be,</v>

961
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:20.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably racist and gross,</v>

962
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:22.450
<v Speaker 2>the gross and racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that.</v>

963
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:23.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to back up a little bit to some </v>

964
00:45:24.701 --> 00:45:25.534
<v Speaker 2>of your history because you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>always a public person and a journalist </v>

965
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:29.770
<v Speaker 2>and someone that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

966
00:45:29.771 --> 00:45:33.010
<v Speaker 2>staked out controversial positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were actually,</v>

967
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.650
<v Speaker 2>you were a private citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were in banking at first,</v>

968
00:45:35.651 --> 00:45:36.484
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

969
00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Laura,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet</v>

970
00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.560
<v Speaker 2>you to go from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a normal job to somebody that's,</v>

971
00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.650
<v Speaker 2>that's out there putting their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their face with their words.</v>

972
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.793
<v Speaker 3>I know I was in studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a same industry with the good prospects </v>

973
00:45:50.941 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 3>and good income and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Matt.</v>

974
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll miss score if he just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't for me.</v>

975
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:56.124
<v Speaker 3>I thought I want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go into an industry where </v>

976
00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:58.134
<v Speaker 3>there's massive job losses and where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be the tiniest of tiny </v>

977
00:46:02.191 --> 00:46:04.080
<v Speaker 3>minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

978
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 3>it will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't completely planned.</v>

979
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 3>It was fairly accidental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was a happy accident.</v>

980
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:10.134
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

981
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed decade in,</v>

982
00:46:11.721 --> 00:46:12.554
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in finance and I think I enjoyed my </v>

983
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:17.250
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the end of it I just had enough.</v>

984
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.280
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

985
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I had much higher than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that point too.</v>

986
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:25.980
<v Speaker 3>So it sort of gave me an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>rethink things.</v>

987
00:46:25.981 --> 00:46:28.500
<v Speaker 3>I went back to university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did my master's,</v>

988
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a,</v>

989
00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:31.614
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of cemented some of my </v>

990
00:46:33.781 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 3>thoughts about higher education and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many junk degrees there are.</v>

991
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:42.860
<v Speaker 3>Just completely pointless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just settling basically.</v>

992
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you think higher education is a waste</v>
<v Speaker 2>altogether?</v>

993
00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.113
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

994
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:47.981
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

995
00:46:47.981 --> 00:46:48.814
<v Speaker 3>not a waste all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think in Australia in particular </v>

996
00:46:52.371 --> 00:46:55.310
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are so many of these junk degrees,</v>

997
00:46:55.311 --> 00:46:59.380
<v Speaker 3>they don't qualify you to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that saddled students with big debts,</v>

998
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.733
<v Speaker 3>raise their expectations and they come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and they know more qualified for a </v>

999
00:47:04.881 --> 00:47:07.370
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when they went in and you know,</v>

1000
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 3>a lot of buddies just lefty </v>
<v Speaker 3>indoctrination posing as education.</v>

1001
00:47:12.231 --> 00:47:14.330
<v Speaker 3>It's just absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1002
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:15.343
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1003
00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for having even more degrees </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1004
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:19.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors and nurses and architects and </v>

1005
00:47:21.651 --> 00:47:23.330
<v Speaker 3>accountants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that actually,</v>

1006
00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>teach you how to do a certain job,</v>

1007
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.750
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.400
<v Speaker 3>bloody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1009
00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 3>master's in gender dance therapy or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else or just,</v>

1010
00:47:32.231 --> 00:47:33.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rides.</v>

1011
00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1012
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:35.380
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will,</v>

1013

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1014
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't planned.</v>

1015
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a by chance and just,</v>

1016
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:46.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm finding myself,</v>

1017
00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:48.280
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's such a wonky term.</v>

1018
00:47:48.281 --> 00:47:49.400
<v Speaker 3>But Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1019
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.280
<v Speaker 3>here I am and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worked out well.</v>

1020
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here you are.</v>

1021
00:47:52.851 --> 00:47:53.621
<v Speaker 2>It's worked out well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1022
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:54.950
<v Speaker 2>we connected on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1023
00:47:54.951 --> 00:47:56.930
<v Speaker 2>maybe six months ago or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

1024
00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:00.260
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's someone else across the world,</v>

1025
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:01.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1027
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1028
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I sense cares about the same things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>care about.</v>

1029
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I see you every now and again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fight with some of the haters.</v>

1030
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not big on fighting with the haters </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a general rule.</v>

1031
00:48:11.871 --> 00:48:15.860
<v Speaker 2>And I see them spewing all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely racist,</v>

1032
00:48:15.861 --> 00:48:17.840
<v Speaker 2>awful things at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They often,</v>

1033
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 2>they often think that you're another </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationality than you are,</v>

1034
00:48:20.681 --> 00:48:21.370
<v Speaker 2>or religion.</v>

1035
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm Indian or Pakistani.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday I was copying it back.</v>

1036
00:48:25.401 --> 00:48:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday I had someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told them,</v>

1037
00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:28.874
<v Speaker 3>I'm not Indiana cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all their sort of a piece was framed </v>

1038
00:48:31.731 --> 00:48:34.520
<v Speaker 3>around me being Indian or Hindu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like never,</v>

1039
00:48:34.521 --> 00:48:37.340
<v Speaker 3>never don't know anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There had never been there.</v>

1040
00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:38.533
<v Speaker 3>I've got to know me and they just refuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>to accept it then I've know you are in </v>

1041
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:43.940
<v Speaker 3>Dnx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All thought it was hilarious.</v>

1042
00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a really fine balance.</v>

1043
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1044
00:48:49.311 --> 00:48:52.430
<v Speaker 3>if I'm giving them advice about </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter's is like don't feed the trolls,</v>

1045
00:48:52.431 --> 00:48:54.410
<v Speaker 3>don't acknowledge them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their attention seekers,</v>

1046
00:48:54.411 --> 00:48:56.390
<v Speaker 3>they're desperate for any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

1047
00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.640
<v Speaker 3>So don't give them what they are looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

1048
00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:00.043
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every now and then I know my whole is </v>

1049
00:49:02.061 --> 00:49:02.894
<v Speaker 3>enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good to call out some filthy </v>

1050
00:49:08.661 --> 00:49:13.661
<v Speaker 3>hypocrites and just highlight the EDC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highlight BDC and hypocrisy and violence</v>

1051
00:49:15.171 --> 00:49:18.410
<v Speaker 3>of some of these social justice warriors</v>
<v Speaker 3>who think,</v>

1052
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1053
00:49:20.121 --> 00:49:23.780
<v Speaker 3>their morals are pristine and who thinks</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're better than the rest of us,</v>

1054
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.830
<v Speaker 3>but they're quite often fairly vile </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

1055
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.860
<v Speaker 3>And I'm happy to mock them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to,</v>

1056
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1057
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.930
<v Speaker 3>how like them to the followers and let </v>
<v Speaker 3>them have their fun with the mom.</v>

1058
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.033
<v Speaker 3>But I knowledge the other way your way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just don't acknowledge them </v>

1059
00:49:40.401 --> 00:49:43.130
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get literally some days,</v>

1060
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:46.430
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of mentions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even read all of them.</v>

1061
00:49:46.431 --> 00:49:47.840
<v Speaker 3>And I certainly don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1062
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.850
<v Speaker 3>respond to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1063
00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:52.730
<v Speaker 3>and it does seem like sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1064
00:49:52.731 --> 00:49:55.970
<v Speaker 3>the overwhelming bulk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a decent comments,</v>

1065
00:49:55.971 --> 00:49:56.804
<v Speaker 3>intelligent comments that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledging and you're acknowledging </v>

1066
00:49:59.001 --> 00:50:00.830
<v Speaker 3>the loon lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1067
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:04.280
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to be a sort of cancer </v>
<v Speaker 3>counter intuitive.</v>

1068
00:50:04.281 --> 00:50:06.330
<v Speaker 3>But I think we've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1069
00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.393
<v Speaker 3>highlight the mentality of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly when they pretend to be </v>

1070
00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.470
<v Speaker 3>morally superior to the rest of us.</v>

1071
00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:13.181
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1072
00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:14.014
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting piece of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we've got the social justice </v>

1073
00:50:16.131 --> 00:50:16.964
<v Speaker 2>warrior class that are moralizing all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us and telling us how racist we are and </v>

1074
00:50:21.111 --> 00:50:23.240
<v Speaker 2>all this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the same time,</v>

1075
00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.020
<v Speaker 2>there absolutely is a piece of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>

1076
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Thing that I've talked about bit a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this show where I get it,</v>

1077
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:31.034
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pepe the frog and Heran Bay and </v>

1078
00:50:32.391 --> 00:50:33.224
<v Speaker 2>they're trolling everybody and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get Hillary to talk about the frog and </v>

1079
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:36.944
<v Speaker 2>they're just internet meme poster is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there shit posters and they want to </v>

1080
00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:41.780
<v Speaker 2>upset everybody and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're perfectly harmless.</v>

1081
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:42.913
<v Speaker 2>But I also do see the real white </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalists stuff and I don't know how </v>

1082
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:48.530
<v Speaker 2>much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my question to you really is,</v>

1083
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.843
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's just I go back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth basically between thinking that </v>

1084
00:50:52.731 --> 00:50:53.564
<v Speaker 2>it's healthy when they get this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>out because then it's not just hidden </v>

1085
00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 2>and secretive and even though they </v>
<v Speaker 2>anonymous whatever,</v>

1086
00:50:59.301 --> 00:51:01.250
<v Speaker 2>they're getting it out versus on another</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

1087
00:51:01.251 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 2>In the last year I had seen more </v>
<v Speaker 2>blatant,</v>

1088
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.890
<v Speaker 2>true hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1089
00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:10.340
<v Speaker 2>than ever before on mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sure which one I,</v>

1090
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.800
<v Speaker 2>whether I think this is actually healthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1091
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:13.813
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>

1092
00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1093
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't set my mind to that too.</v>

1094
00:51:17.921 --> 00:51:18.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

1095
00:51:18.941 --> 00:51:19.774
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just seem like an absolute is sewer </v>

1096
00:51:21.251 --> 00:51:22.320
<v Speaker 3>at times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twitter,</v>

1097
00:51:22.321 --> 00:51:23.154
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more so than any other social media </v>

1098
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.453
<v Speaker 3>forum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be just a bio field slur </v>

1099
00:51:31.361 --> 00:51:35.380
<v Speaker 3>full of people who are miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who just want to fight.</v>

1100
00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:36.670
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1101
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.113
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1102
00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1103
00:51:41.551 --> 00:51:45.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really not nasty Nazi,</v>

1104
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:47.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>types.</v>

1105
00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:48.004
<v Speaker 3>I haven't encountered too many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a few and I've just bought </v>

1106
00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:51.660
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1107
00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there've been very few in numbers as</v>

1108
00:51:54.341 --> 00:51:55.174
<v Speaker 3>far as the ones attacking maze now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure of the size of that </v>

1109
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.960
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's any way Nia,</v>

1110
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.820
<v Speaker 3>the size of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the other side.</v>

1111
00:52:03.821 --> 00:52:06.250
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sign of them isn't healthy.</v>

1112
00:52:06.251 --> 00:52:07.084
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they should be treated with </v>

1113
00:52:08.771 --> 00:52:11.950
<v Speaker 3>absolute disdain that should be called </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1114
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:14.710
<v Speaker 3>They should be mocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I tend to do.</v>

1115
00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1116
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.340
<v Speaker 3>convince these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ain't tried to reeducate them.</v>

1117
00:52:18.341 --> 00:52:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I just mock them because that's all they</v>
<v Speaker 3>deserve.</v>

1118
00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:22.690
<v Speaker 3>They don't deserve your time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't deserve,</v>

1119
00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:24.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think twitter is a really dumb </v>

1120
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.430
<v Speaker 3>forum for in depth arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1121
00:52:27.431 --> 00:52:29.380
<v Speaker 3>you just kind of have them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1122
00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.470
<v Speaker 3>that's not the place for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1123
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.390
<v Speaker 3>discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:52:34.391 --> 00:52:39.391
<v Speaker 3>You try to frame your point of view in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as fewer characters as possible.</v>

1125
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:40.953
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you actually trying to have a </v>

1126
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.473
<v Speaker 3>proper discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that's the forum for </v>

1127
00:52:45.071 --> 00:52:45.320
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1128
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see a new center sort of lining </v>

1129
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:52.490
<v Speaker 2>up all over the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think even a year ago or so,</v>

1130
00:52:52.491 --> 00:52:53.324
<v Speaker 2>people were barely talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the people that are </v>

1131
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.133
<v Speaker 2>not the far right prue white </v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacists or racist or whatever you </v>

1132
00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:02.090
<v Speaker 2>want to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1133
00:53:02.091 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't like using all the buzzwords and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1134
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:07.850
<v Speaker 2>and not the regressive left and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sjws and all that,</v>

1135
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:12.320
<v Speaker 2>but that there is some sort of new </v>
<v Speaker 2>center lining up and it's because of the</v>

1136
00:53:12.321 --> 00:53:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Internet because people like us had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to,</v>

1137
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to connect that my friend Ali Rizvi up </v>

1138
00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:19.820
<v Speaker 2>in Canada who's an atheist Muslim coined</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phrase,</v>

1139
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:21.130
<v Speaker 2>the new center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that's,</v>

1140
00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:21.973
<v Speaker 2>that's the new home politically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you sense that this could actually </v>

1141
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:25.100
<v Speaker 2>become a political</v>

1142
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.493
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think political parties are starting </v>

1143
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:35.061
<v Speaker 3>to recognize what the electorate cares </v>
<v Speaker 3>about and they need,</v>

1144
00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:36.363
<v Speaker 3>you've got to think the Republicans have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to regroup over the next decade and </v>

1145
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:45.390
<v Speaker 3>recognize that they abandoned their </v>
<v Speaker 3>base,</v>

1146
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:50.070
<v Speaker 3>that they had so many people so </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperately unhappy with them.</v>

1147
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so eager to jump on the,</v>

1148
00:53:52.201 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 3>on the trump train and in Australia as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1149
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:56.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last election,</v>

1150
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1151
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:59.420
<v Speaker 3>something between one or 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>votes,</v>

1152
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.700
<v Speaker 3>2 million voters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a significant figure here.</v>

1153
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:05.220
<v Speaker 3>We're a small country of conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>voters,</v>

1154
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:08.060
<v Speaker 3>took their vote elsewhere from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the mainstream,</v>

1155
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.790
<v Speaker 3>a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a liberal national coalition.</v>

1156
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think there is this new center,</v>

1157
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and where it is,</v>

1158
00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.730
<v Speaker 3>is the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a far more,</v>

1159
00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:20.973
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the right then the media class would </v>

1160
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:26.730
<v Speaker 3>want it to be and acknowledge it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1161
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:28.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean their right wing.</v>

1162
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.330
<v Speaker 3>I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1163
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.373
<v Speaker 3>in their economic point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their attitude to borders and </v>

1164
00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:39.060
<v Speaker 3>immigration and national security,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're far more,</v>

1165
00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative then then the media class,</v>

1166
00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.753
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would like them to be and acknowledging </v>

1167
00:54:44.591 --> 00:54:45.424
<v Speaker 3>them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the politicians have no </v>

1168
00:54:48.901 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 3>choice but to acknowledge it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:54:51.091 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 3>They can't ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then their political survival depends on</v>

1170
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:55.344
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1171
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whether you let me,</v>

1172
00:54:56.531 --> 00:54:57.364
<v Speaker 3>you actually see the emergence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>new party is something else too to </v>

1173
00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:02.190
<v Speaker 3>ponder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure about that.</v>

1174
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.350
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's talk of that in Australia.</v>

1175
00:55:04.351 --> 00:55:05.940
<v Speaker 3>There's talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1176
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.833
<v Speaker 3>an actual new conservative party that </v>
<v Speaker 3>will bring in all these sort of minor </v>

1177
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:13.220
<v Speaker 3>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Losier's um,</v>

1178
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.273
<v Speaker 3>but it hasn't happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that's been talked about </v>

1179
00:55:15.691 --> 00:55:18.300
<v Speaker 3>or whether it actually been choice is </v>
<v Speaker 3>another question.</v>

1180
00:55:18.301 --> 00:55:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
00:55:20.061 --> 00:55:22.580
<v Speaker 2>a second ago you started to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more right,</v>

1183
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:24.710
<v Speaker 2>but you really meant conservative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you,</v>

1184
00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.690
<v Speaker 2>you fixed.</v>

1185
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:26.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1186
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.360
<v Speaker 3>I do to change,</v>

1187
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.961
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1188
00:55:28.961 --> 00:55:29.500
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1189
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I bring that up only because it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>even people like you to make your point,</v>

1190
00:55:34.271 --> 00:55:36.760
<v Speaker 2>you still want to be so concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the language.</v>

1191
00:55:36.761 --> 00:55:38.890
<v Speaker 2>And I feel that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're,</v>

1192
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:42.460
<v Speaker 2>we're so just under this thing where if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say one thing wrong and implied that</v>

1193
00:55:42.461 --> 00:55:44.440
<v Speaker 2>the conservatives are really far right </v>
<v Speaker 2>or that,</v>

1194
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:46.660
<v Speaker 2>that everyone will be all over you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that what a,</v>

1195
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:49.750
<v Speaker 2>what a crazy place for people like us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in.</v>

1196
00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>

1197
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:51.894
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are just so hyper sensitive to </v>

1198
00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:53.971
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1199
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:54.804
<v Speaker 3>and so looking to be offended by </v>
<v Speaker 3>something or take something out of </v>

1200
00:55:58.591 --> 00:56:01.050
<v Speaker 3>context that you do sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1201
00:56:01.051 --> 00:56:01.884
<v Speaker 3>even someone who doesn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't give a stuff about political </v>

1202
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:05.904
<v Speaker 3>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find yourself qualifying things and </v>

1203
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 3>explaining things like over explaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1204
00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1205
00:56:12.511 --> 00:56:13.460
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1206
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.990
<v Speaker 3>I guess we're not immune to it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

1207
00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:19.980
<v Speaker 3>we live in that world and we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge it.</v>

1208
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.273
<v Speaker 2>I wish we were over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see people on twitter telling me </v>

1209
00:56:22.601 --> 00:56:24.850
<v Speaker 2>sometimes times we could see it get over</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

1210
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:25.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1211
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 2>just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1212
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still trying to be a person that,</v>

1213
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.130
<v Speaker 2>a good person that exists in 2016 so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my last,</v>

1214
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.920
<v Speaker 2>my last question for you is taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that we've discussed here,</v>

1215
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think the best thing for,</v>

1216
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:41.020
<v Speaker 2>for people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are hearing our messages,</v>

1217
00:56:41.021 --> 00:56:41.854
<v Speaker 2>whether they a little more right or </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative or a little more left or </v>

1218
00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:45.934
<v Speaker 2>liberal or whatever it is for all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that are hearing this and </v>

1219
00:56:48.311 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 2>seeing the same trends that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about all over the world,</v>

1220
00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:55.690
<v Speaker 2>what is the best thing that they can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>to help fix some of this stuff?</v>

1221
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Be Brave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Bold.</v>

1222
00:56:59.461 --> 00:57:00.294
<v Speaker 3>Say what she think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the message to take out </v>

1223
00:57:02.941 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be afraid,</v>

1224
00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:07.500
<v Speaker 3>don't be bullied into silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't feel like,</v>

1225
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:11.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your point of view isn't worthy of being</v>

1226
00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 3>aired and discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And don't worry about,</v>

1227
00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:15.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say something,</v>

1228
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.033
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be unfriended on </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook by someone you went to school </v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1230
00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:21.733

1233

<v Speaker 3>to become political nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>days ago in our Internet blew out.</v>

1244
00:57:55.711 --> 00:57:56.544
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody is watching us and they didn't </v>

1245
00:57:57.781 --> 00:57:58.614

<v Speaker 3>I don't even believe that was just </v>

1247
00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:01.394
<v Speaker 3>coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's obviously some sort of the left </v>

1248
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:05.580
<v Speaker 3>wing conspiracy to silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation possible.</v>

1250
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Definitely some sort of left wing </v>
