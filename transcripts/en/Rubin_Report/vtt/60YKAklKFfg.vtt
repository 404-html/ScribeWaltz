<v Speaker 1>It's good to be in la.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

7
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to have you on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been trying to do this for about a</v>

8
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.710
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>you're a busy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like to think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might just be a facade I put her onto</v>

11
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.073
<v Speaker 1>avoid people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one actually were in reality now </v>

12
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a pretty busy year.</v>

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like extremely so.</v>

14
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't ever seem to slow up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to think it does.</v>

15
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Something else jumps off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>if you think coming out of this show is </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna help slow it down.</v>

17
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 1>You are sorely mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm a bit of a masochist in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>

19
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see.</v>

20
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 1>We'll see by the time this hour he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>done work on earth.</v>

21
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can release you.</v>

22
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure there will be some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry because there will be equal </v>

24
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>amounts of me just sitting here with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say I've been blind to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

27
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>but just being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seeing some of the reaction and the</v>

28
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.194
<v Speaker 1>responses that I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially like for instance when I was </v>

29
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>on radar when I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After I did Bill Maher,</v>

30
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.413
<v Speaker 1>I still saw some of the comments from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the like I say the other side just for </v>

31
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:10.904
<v Speaker 1>ease of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for people who largely don't agree </v>

32
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>with me and his audience and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

33
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would drive the NRA guy on there?</v>

34
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.323
<v Speaker 1>Even a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a tweet I responded to yesterday </v>

35
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.163
<v Speaker 1>and even though I was on my no tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal that I like to put my cell phone </v>

36
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>because so toxic and they're sometimes.</v>

37
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>How often do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every 30 minutes.</v>

38
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do weekends disappearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of August see it man.</v>

39
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.423
<v Speaker 1>Twitter's toxic man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're in the lane that you and I </v>

40
00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>are and it's toxic man and it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

41
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Even though you don't think you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking that in,</v>

42
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>even when you just kind of scrolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

43
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>you're taking that in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.133
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like I constantly have to </v>

45
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:50.734
<v Speaker 1>develop this pattern of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't respond to that because </v>

46
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.640
<v Speaker 1>they're baiting you and things of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

47
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.890
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

48
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I saw a tweet and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

49
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

50
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I love this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have that NRA guy on there.</v>

51
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

52
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>are we not allowed to have discourse </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore if it,</v>

53
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.470
<v Speaker 1>especially if it disagrees with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you believe in and,</v>

54
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:12.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

55
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>this is a very dangerous road we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down if that's,</v>

56
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>if that's going to be the case because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you forget,</v>

57
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in this country together and </v>

58
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>we're not all the same.</v>

59
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>There's about 350 million might not all </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the same thing.</v>

60
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty crazy.</v>

61
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of sad.</v>

62
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:28.940
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for me,</v>

63
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.933
<v Speaker 1>it's a little disheartening because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up under the guise and </v>

64
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:35.024
<v Speaker 1>understanding the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse and being able to talk things </v>

65
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>out even if you do disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

66
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.973
<v Speaker 1>But then they even still having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to set aside whatever views I </v>

67
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:43.334
<v Speaker 1>may have on a particular issue and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to speak with you cordially or </v>

68
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>have respect for you even though we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree that's the way I was brought</v>

69
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:50.624
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to see the country kind of </v>

70
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:57.281
<v Speaker 1>falling into this extremely vitriolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>divisiveness it,</v>

71
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>it's heartening to know me get all emo </v>
<v Speaker 1>on you,</v>

72
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>but it does it like we don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess cried until the end.</v>

73
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.380
<v Speaker 1>We can do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

74
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:08.214
<v Speaker 1>But that's exactly why I wanted to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you on because you are okay going into </v>

75
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>enemy territory.</v>

76
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not calling this enemy territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you did,</v>

77
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.733
<v Speaker 1>you did Maurice Show where you knew a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain percentage of the audience was </v>

78
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:17.494
<v Speaker 1>just going to hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about it briefly right </v>

79
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.104
<v Speaker 1>before we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you found Martin to basically </v>

80
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty respected.</v>

81
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.053
<v Speaker 1>Even kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Even though I'm policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably disagrees with you with 80,</v>

83
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of this tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.391
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

85
00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:31.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was something that I ended up </v>

86
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>respecting about him in that regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like I said,</v>

87
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went in prepared for,</v>

88
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go into dual war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I went and prepared for it,</v>

89
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like prepare for the worst,</v>

90
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.570
<v Speaker 1>hope for the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

91
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>and I tell you I got the best in a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it was a,</v>

92
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>it was a discourse where he challenged </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

93
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.983
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't this kind of tumultuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of butting of heads where it was </v>

94
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>just turned into something that was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly.</v>

95
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

96
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't trying to get.</v>

97
00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Trying to understand you because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

99
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do that here.</v>

100
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a couple other places </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are trying to do that.</v>

101
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:08.670
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that's been lost.</v>

102
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's an interesting thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out there.</v>

103
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes people take offense to</v>

104
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.023
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

105
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to intrude.</v>

106
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think intrigued kind of offense people</v>

107
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.094
<v Speaker 1>sometimes because it's like we all grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with a typical understanding of what </v>

108
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>we expect certain people to be like and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then when certain things don't fit,</v>

109
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.411
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

110
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you get there?</v>

111
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.163
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when it's innocent like </v>

112
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:31.894
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's an issue there </v>

113
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.483
<v Speaker 1>when you use it to try to kind of muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>people into believing a certain thing </v>

114
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.953
<v Speaker 1>based on what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's when we start having </v>

115
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.684
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

116
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.553
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you see me as like how to you </v>

117
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:44.104
<v Speaker 1>as a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it happened to me when I first </v>

118
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>started doing what I did with the NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Russell Simmons or,</v>

119
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.390
<v Speaker 1>and I'll never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

120
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I was like in Virginia Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

121
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Russell said,</v>

122
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:54.484
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

123
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.413
<v Speaker 1>I did my first sets of videos rolled out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the NRA and I get this tweet from </v>

124
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Russell Simmons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

125
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>how can you as a young black man push </v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

126
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the typical rhetoric in that regard,</v>

127
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.420
<v Speaker 1>even though he often is all about trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get people to.</v>

128
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which was really odd.</v>

129
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I responded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

131
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't know advocating for self </v>

132
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>defense and self reliance was a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

133
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that only non black people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were allowed to do that.</v>

134
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.790
<v Speaker 1>And so that was Kinda like my first </v>
<v Speaker 1>foray into that world of wait a minute.</v>

135
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:27.814
<v Speaker 1>People have an expectation of me based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my race that I'm not going to say I </v>

136
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>was oblivious to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>

137
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.643
<v Speaker 1>when it was coming from people that look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me as well with the same level of </v>

138
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I go wow.</v>

139
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

140
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what this is.</v>

141
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want,</v>

142
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.073
<v Speaker 1>I want to back up a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood and growing up because you're </v>

143
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>evolutions kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

144
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.703
<v Speaker 1>But let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just sit with this for one second </v>

145
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's something really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about that thing right there</v>

146
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>that often if you listened to the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll you that that police are hunting</v>

147
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black men are and all of this,</v>

148
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>and then at the same time you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.114
<v Speaker 1>we should be able to arm ourselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect ourselves from the white </v>

150
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:08.950
<v Speaker 1>supremacists.</v>

151
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.170
<v Speaker 1>See whoever is doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but meaning that lawfully and legally we</v>

152
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>should be able to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

153
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.764
<v Speaker 1>If you believe that the system is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and the police are so corrupt </v>

154
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>and there's racists running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>

155
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to bring the power back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

156
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 1>That's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very empowering.</v>

157
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.483
<v Speaker 1>Yet somehow this seemingly is lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this conversation hits the </v>

158
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

159
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.963
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in one breath you're talking </v>

160
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:38.084
<v Speaker 1>about let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take the current administration </v>

161
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:39.554
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll paint it as this the most </v>

162
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>vicious involving on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's like,</v>

163
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.510
<v Speaker 1>well then let's give the same guns that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have for your own self reliance.</v>

164
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.373
<v Speaker 1>Would you would use to protect yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>against this monster that you said </v>

165
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.934
<v Speaker 1>existed and let's give it to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then place your entire alliance with </v>

166
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:57.910
<v Speaker 1>respect to your safety on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you,</v>

167
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me I should be scared of.</v>

168
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them your weapons.</v>

169
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.280
<v Speaker 1>What again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just it's,</v>

170
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it's mindblowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

171
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.950
<v Speaker 1>And so what it does though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it exposes this notion that the,</v>

172
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.963
<v Speaker 1>there's an absence of ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say mobility or people </v>

173
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:17.534
<v Speaker 1>just choosing not to critically think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're at a point now where we have </v>

174
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.903
<v Speaker 1>access and I tell people it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it amazes me some of the questions that </v>

175
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:26.384
<v Speaker 1>I get and it's like you literally have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>device that gives you access to all of </v>

176
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 1>the information in the world and it's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pocket.</v>

177
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 1>And in the case of my overabundant </v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks,</v>

178
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I have two of them and it's like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes you to fall into your.</v>

179
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I assume you have like eight guns on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

180
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Those rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some here.</v>

181
00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:49.240
<v Speaker 1>So you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

182
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how when we have such </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to so much information,</v>

183
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 1>we've become so lazy at reaching for it.</v>

184
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>This was almost like back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we didn't have this access,</v>

185
00:07:58.941 --> 00:07:59.774
<v Speaker 1>we were more adamant about search </v>
<v Speaker 1>searching and seeking it out and </v>

186
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>critically thinking about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>

187
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>we've become too fast for our own good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

188
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 1>So the obsession now is instant </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

189
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>instant information regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the information is of any</v>

190
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>use or good or the or if it's even </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

191
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

192
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>And so it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it because,</v>

193
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

194
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.593
<v Speaker 1>I blogged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done all of those things and </v>

195
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.393
<v Speaker 1>actually get people get mad at me when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't jump on a certain issue quick </v>

196
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I say quick enough,</v>

197
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:28.694
<v Speaker 1>within 30 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second I'll see that sometimes </v>

198
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>something goes down in the news and </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally two minutes go by her,</v>

199
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm at dinner and I wasn't living at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

200
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll get a slew of tweets.</v>

201
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I see you didn't comment on that.</v>

202
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.873
<v Speaker 1>You must be in and God paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God forbid it involves a black person </v>

203
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>and there's a gun within 10 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to jump on it.</v>

204
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some cases I understand there's </v>

205
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.863
<v Speaker 1>some people who do who are just now </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into this who are just now </v>

206
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>getting into firearms and they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

207
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

208
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>they look to me for understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction because I've been doing it for</v>

209
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.580
<v Speaker 1>so long so that I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

210
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.463
<v Speaker 1>but other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just this constant desire to be </v>

211
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

212
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew you were coon kind of deal.</v>

213
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

214
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.143
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me 30 seconds to even read the </v>

215
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>article you just sent me 10 seconds ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from there,</v>

217
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>and then not to mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 1>there's this thing called work that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

219
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still doing that as well.</v>

220
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:20.091
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

221
00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm juggling a lot of things.</v>

222
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.083
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have to read 10 more </v>

223
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>articles to even ascertain anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the truth.</v>

224
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.883
<v Speaker 1>Bingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the one thing that I think a </v>

225
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:30.114
<v Speaker 1>lot of people don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And almost tweeted that the other day I </v>

226
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:32.514
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.353
<v Speaker 1>it's very dangerous to read headlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the day and age of </v>

228
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.863
<v Speaker 1>clickbait titles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just read headlines and then make an </v>

229
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 1>opinion based off of that or think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

230
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 1>understand what happened at a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>story because there are so many articles</v>

231
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.313
<v Speaker 1>that I've read about me and what I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>said where the headline said one thing </v>

232
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 1>and to cover their assets within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

233
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 1>They'll clarify exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that I said,</v>

234
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.653
<v Speaker 1>but they're banking on the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just going to read the </v>

235
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:03.174
<v Speaker 1>headlines and then run with that and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it ends up making a fool of you in full </v>

236
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

237
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>What's your personal policy on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About how to respond to that?</v>

238
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you go all in on the fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ignore it?</v>

239
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Because that this has happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>just in the last week.</v>

240
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Daily be said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was all right.</v>

241
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Cheerleader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

242
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're black.</v>

243
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I think so how am I doing for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For an orange,</v>

244
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you suck now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:27.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

246
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 1>but this is the level of pity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it's about how much time do you</v>

247
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:32.064
<v Speaker 1>want to invest in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in defending yourself and by doing that </v>

248
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:35.544
<v Speaker 1>defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you just add intensity to the people </v>

249
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:38.424
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see we can get them to defend himself </v>

250
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.703
<v Speaker 1>and then before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole life is dedicated to </v>

251
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:43.224
<v Speaker 1>defending yourself from fake attacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than you and the work that you </v>

252
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 1>care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>

253
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.354
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it to you because you're </v>

254
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:50.034
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

255
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.173
<v Speaker 1>You're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Because you agree with me in </v>

256
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain issues,</v>

257
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.673
<v Speaker 1>you're dangerous and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just simply willing to talk to </v>

258
00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>

259
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 1>same thing happened when I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the interview with killer Mike,</v>

260
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They jumped all over him,</v>

261
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 1>not because of what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just because he sat down and had the</v>

262
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 1>conversation with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the time they don't even listen.</v>

263
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

264
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.670
<v Speaker 1>You can point it out because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to my friend.</v>

265
00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:15.504
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

266
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.020
<v Speaker 1>how can anyone watch this interview and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not walk away with saying,</v>

267
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:19.854
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a great conversation about two </v>

268
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:21.414
<v Speaker 1>people who don't agree on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some things we agree on </v>

269
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't watch it.</v>

270
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

271
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like I had just this weird blonde </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

272
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:28.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

273
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

274
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.050
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

275
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 1>they didn't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

276
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>they don't actually watch the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just read the title and then assume</v>

277
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>they know what happened in the video and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then make their opinion from there.</v>

278
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.201
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

279
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:41.034
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate going down in the weeds with too </v>

280
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:45.900
<v Speaker 1>much in this because it feels like we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just responding to all of the craziness.</v>

281
00:11:45.901 --> 00:11:46.734
<v Speaker 1>But even in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in like the youtube ecosystem when </v>

282
00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:51.054
<v Speaker 1>we put videos up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes within 10 there's 100 condoms </v>

283
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 1>and that was an hour of want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that time when she can,</v>

284
00:11:58.331 --> 00:11:59.164
<v Speaker 1>because I will be a lot more productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's always the haters that that's </v>

285
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:03.034
<v Speaker 1>why I wouldn't bring it up because it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then that heat is the thing </v>

286
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.424
<v Speaker 1>that's always leading us and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that brings it back to where you </v>

287
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:09.574
<v Speaker 1>started a moment ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that we're in this polarized </v>

288
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 1>thing and it's because the haters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sort of paving the road and everyone</v>

289
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 1>else is just going down the road.</v>

290
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I think a few of us are actually trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to better road that.</v>

291
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:21.424
<v Speaker 1>More of us can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing about the </v>

292
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 1>discourse the way it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

293
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And so our politics have become our </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment.</v>

294
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that's the dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect,</v>

295
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's not vitriolic,</v>

296
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:36.160
<v Speaker 1>if it's not snarky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not any of those things,</v>

297
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.370
<v Speaker 1>if people don't pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm the biggest advocate of like,</v>

298
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

299
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't agree with me on something,</v>

300
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be an ass about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

301
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Can I be snarky?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>

302
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:47.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

303
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I can absolutely be snarky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I,</v>

304
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.240
<v Speaker 1>what I tried to do in response to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>initial question,</v>

305
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 1>you asked me how do I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I go all in?</v>

306
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Do I respond?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like for instance on twitter,</v>

307
00:12:55.871 --> 00:12:56.704
<v Speaker 1>what I've kind of held myself back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing now is if I can tell that the </v>

308
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>person is literally seeking out an </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer or response,</v>

309
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 1>that's I'm going to give them that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy in terms of,</v>

310
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

311
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have that conversation.</v>

312
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.023
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there was a point in time where </v>

313
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.243
<v Speaker 1>everything I responded to when I respond</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it through the lens of just being </v>

314
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 1>this snarky on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

315
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

316
00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:21.190
<v Speaker 1>it was entertaining myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

317
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.473
<v Speaker 1>But then I had to ask myself was I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really moving the conversation and the </v>

318
00:13:24.561 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 1>dialogue along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it is twitter,</v>

319
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dumpster fire,</v>

320
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 1>but when I started has some importance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does just the truth.</v>

321
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:33.844
<v Speaker 1>That's why it keeps coming up in so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these conversations that high level </v>

322
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:40.230
<v Speaker 1>people with great minds that are open </v>
<v Speaker 1>and engaging,</v>

323
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.460
<v Speaker 1>that are still involved in the stupidity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

324
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:45.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I always feel guilty when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it up with a guest.</v>

325
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to touch that again.</v>

326
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.640
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know it's really just,</v>

327
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.580
<v Speaker 1>it just is whether we want it to be or </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

328
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.950
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we like,</v>

329
00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this the medium of expression right now.</v>

330
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we have to either adapt or die,</v>

331
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

332
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:01.744
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

333
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>

334
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:04.774
<v Speaker 1>I try to be what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be the opposite of what I </v>

335
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 1>could plan about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I try in terms of like,</v>

336
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.743
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'll see snarky messages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll respond by trying to be </v>

337
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:14.260
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

338
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:15.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

339
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>You don't like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but answer this question for me.</v>

340
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to move the dialogue along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:24.170
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening to get deleted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Almost every single time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.490
<v Speaker 1>The second you shed a little light on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

344
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Grad scatter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

345
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.883
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

346
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.790
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

347
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.673
<v Speaker 1>before we dive too much into your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the thing that they're </v>

348
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.943
<v Speaker 1>criticizing you most for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you come across to me as a pretty </v>

349
00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decent,</v>

350
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 1>open guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to empower yourself.</v>

351
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:44.643
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is it that they're always going </v>

352
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:47.464
<v Speaker 1>after you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it that thing that black men </v>

353
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be for guns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

354
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 1>is it that simply stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

355
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.833
<v Speaker 1>so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be so naive to assume </v>

356
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:58.300
<v Speaker 1>it's simply just because I'm black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the guns and holds up.</v>

357
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of it is just aligning</v>

358
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>myself in the organization that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly,</v>

359
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 1>that they see as being a racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization that hates black people.</v>

360
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to talk plenty about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NRA.</v>

361
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that element of it,</v>

362
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:12.254
<v Speaker 1>but then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is also this idea that being a </v>

363
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:15.044
<v Speaker 1>young black man that I am supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run from guns because of the projected </v>

364
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:20.714
<v Speaker 1>image that we've all had forced down our</v>
<v Speaker 1>throats with respect to black men and </v>

365
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 1>firearms in this country for decades.</v>

366
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black man with a gun,</v>

367
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 1>he's a thug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a drug dealer.</v>

368
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:34.691
<v Speaker 1>He was a gang banger period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now when I young,</v>

369
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.490
<v Speaker 1>attorney educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open minded and you know,</v>

370
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.483
<v Speaker 1>with respect to different issues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm pushing the narrative of the </v>

371
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:44.474
<v Speaker 1>second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sets off an explosive level of </v>

372
00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 1>cognitive dissonance in people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I love this quote and I believe was</v>

373
00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Bush who said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soft bigotry of low expectations,</v>

374
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

375
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.280
<v Speaker 1>they hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate it the same way they,</v>

376
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.173
<v Speaker 1>they hate you now because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>control someone who's willing to think </v>

377
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 1>independently outside of what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypically expected of you.</v>

378
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

379
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's where the labels come in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

380
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do progressive or liberal,</v>

381
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:16.004
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

382
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 1>but you still have that ability to step </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of that and say,</v>

383
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me let me.</v>

384
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that perspective.</v>

385
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:23.810
<v Speaker 1>That's dangerous for people who want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control people.</v>

386
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.240
<v Speaker 1>So when I want to control the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

387
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:27.074
<v Speaker 1>the way you see yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot allow you to develop it and </v>

388
00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:30.224
<v Speaker 1>ability to think independently on </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate issues because then I can't </v>

389
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:35.270
<v Speaker 1>control you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>

390
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.380
<v Speaker 1>if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

391
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I can do everything for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depend on me.</v>

392
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.940
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I want you to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand this,</v>

393
00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:43.761
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

394
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 1>You mean to tell me I could protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

395
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Speaker 1>You mean to tell me I don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>depend on calling a cop in order to come</v>

396
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:48.854
<v Speaker 1>save me if someone does try to break </v>
<v Speaker 1>into my house because then I can't </v>

397
00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:52.154
<v Speaker 1>control you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't own your vote because what the </v>

398
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:55.844
<v Speaker 1>gun has done for me and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>it serves as a catalyst for awakening </v>

399
00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of people don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:03.740
<v Speaker 1>what I can do more for myself than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

401
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once that,</v>

402
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 1>once that spark is set off than a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

403
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>you start to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:10.681
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:17:10.681 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>what maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.243
<v Speaker 1>not on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding myself to a different level </v>

407
00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:14.870
<v Speaker 1>of accountability.</v>

408
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I might try to do this on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.943
<v Speaker 1>just feel good and they put an aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people are into facts </v>

410
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:23.354
<v Speaker 1>over feelings these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Shapiro but doesn't that statement </v>

411
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>right there that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can do more for yourself.</v>

412
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.033
<v Speaker 1>It just feels good like pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making some power back to yourself and </v>

413
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:34.904
<v Speaker 1>go and the government or you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever you are or are not in charge of </v>

414
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.820
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my responsibility,</v>

415
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:42.100
<v Speaker 1>my livelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family,</v>

416
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:42.963
<v Speaker 1>the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most invigorating feeling in </v>

417
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm with you.</v>

418
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm all about facts over feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm meaning from standpoint.</v>

419
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't allow my feelings to dictate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

420
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think feelings are necessary,</v>

421
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we would,</v>

422
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just become cold,</v>

423
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:01.850
<v Speaker 1>calculated creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

424
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And we are still human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are getting,</v>

425
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

426
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's like now at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

427
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:11.541
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about the issue of firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do actively try to inquire.</v>

428
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:12.984
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having a discussion with a lady </v>

429
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:19.230
<v Speaker 1>not too long ago about just general </v>
<v Speaker 1>firearm issues with respect to her son.</v>

430
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the young black man.</v>

431
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:21.871
<v Speaker 1>And I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

432
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:22.704
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you fearful of the idea of him </v>

433
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 1>carrying a gun and so forth and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have to bring myself back when I'm</v>

434
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 1>having a discussion with someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because I don't have kids.</v>

435
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Yeah,</v>

436
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and my godfather that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

437
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:36.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

438
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love her but it's not the same for</v>

439
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:41.664
<v Speaker 1>a woman who has a son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have to be cognizant of that and </v>

440
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:49.260
<v Speaker 1>understand what goes into that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's thinking about whether or not she,</v>

441
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.510
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is okay with him owning a firearm.</v>

442
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.343
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that having this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that her son is more likely to get </v>

443
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 1>killed by a cop because he has a gun on </v>
<v Speaker 1>him versus when he doesn't,</v>

444
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.043
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the feeling component </v>

445
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.484
<v Speaker 1>comes in where it's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you can't sympathize with </v>

446
00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it makes you dismissive.</v>

447
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And so then that person can't relate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

448
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:12.780
<v Speaker 1>then we can have that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

449
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.703
<v Speaker 1>And that comes from personal experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I was reading your bio </v>

450
00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:17.281
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

451
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.114
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting stuff about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you evolve sort of politically and </v>

452
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:21.354
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you started getting into guns </v>

453
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 1>you kind of had to hide it from your mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

454
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.030
<v Speaker 1>So everyone actually takes a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

455
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.260
<v Speaker 1>about growing up and then sort of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of politics and then how do we,</v>

456
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.930
<v Speaker 1>how do we get so into gun director?</v>

457
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.860
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up largely a closet anti gunner.</v>

458
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize I was going the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one president,</v>

459
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't kind of rapidly running out,</v>

460
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.781
<v Speaker 1>running out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>

461
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I hate guns or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when a woman was president,</v>

462
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember there's one moment when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in college,</v>

463
00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I had a roommate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

464
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:50.550
<v Speaker 1>when their friends brought a gun over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

465
00:19:50.551 --> 00:19:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you need to get the hell out my part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the hell out of my apartment.</v>

466
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.223
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a good friend of mine who randomly </v>

467
00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:58.980
<v Speaker 1>just asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

468
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.230
<v Speaker 1>do you want to go to the range?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never even thought about it.</v>

469
00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Never even crossed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is how I know a lot of times I can</v>

470
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:05.214
<v Speaker 1>decipher based on certain comments </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not somebody is actually </v>

471
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.753
<v Speaker 1>coming from a place of ignorance or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of understanding because I was </v>

472
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 1>that guy never even thought about going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to range,</v>

473
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.960
<v Speaker 1>never thought about shooting gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you all their opinions on</v>

474
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:19.794
<v Speaker 1>the world wide.</v>

475
00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:20.853
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I hear that rhetoric now I </v>

476
00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:25.380
<v Speaker 1>can usually point it out and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never shopped before.</v>

477
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>You've never even held a gun before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so from that perspective,</v>

478
00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:32.700
<v Speaker 1>we went to the gun range and shot for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time and I was hooked.</v>

479
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.283
<v Speaker 1>Now I was hooked not from a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint now with not even from an </v>

480
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:38.280
<v Speaker 1>empowering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

481
00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:39.114
<v Speaker 1>I can protect myself now standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just pure fascination with the </v>

482
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:42.570
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physics,</v>

483
00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:44.910
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very kind of like,</v>

484
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.550
<v Speaker 1>curious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me it was like kind of like this,</v>

485
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:49.384
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that I'm launching a </v>
<v Speaker 1>project out faster than the speed of </v>

486
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:54.370
<v Speaker 1>sound and a little target 100 yards </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

487
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Like that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first shot you were hooked,</v>

488
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>first shot terrified me the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a little bit second shot.</v>

489
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

490
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so from that perspective,</v>

491
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so after that,</v>

492
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.033
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I follow that rabbit all the way down </v>

493
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

494
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more from a scientific,</v>

495
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 1>mechanical understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then as time went on,</v>

496
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 1>then I started looking at it from more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

497
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.760
<v Speaker 1>second amendment political activist </v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint and then I started my,</v>

498
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:27.970
<v Speaker 1>then the lawyer mind kicked in and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I started looking.</v>

499
00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing something.</v>

500
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 1>We [inaudible] we during the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

501
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:31.714
<v Speaker 1>Then that particular time period we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of pretty big mass shootings </v>

502
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:34.834
<v Speaker 1>that happened and so I started paying it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so now I'm paying attention more to </v>

503
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.254
<v Speaker 1>this kind of like when you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about buying a car and you never see it </v>

504
00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:41.404
<v Speaker 1>on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you start thinking about </v>

505
00:21:41.831 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 1>buying you see it everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty much what happened now.</v>

506
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.033
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing the conversation about guns </v>

507
00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:46.834
<v Speaker 1>everywhere now and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this is making any sense </v>

508
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 1>logically like what people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposing.</v>

509
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so pure,</v>

510
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like an agenda driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

511
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a window,</v>

512
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.600
<v Speaker 1>like a sticker on the window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to stop somebody from bringing</v>

513
00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:06.601
<v Speaker 1>a gun in there saying that it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the dad's not going to read the</v>

514
00:22:07.591 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 1>sign and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh exactly.</v>

515
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I go to the other place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

516
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.960
<v Speaker 1>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Kinda when I started jumping into</v>

517
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:18.200
<v Speaker 1>the more activist advocate side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

518
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.810
<v Speaker 1>with respect to the second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you first got guns.</v>

519
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were literally hiding them from your</v>

520
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause cause,</v>

521
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.073
<v Speaker 1>cause she was very much let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a single parent mom raising a </v>

522
00:22:29.051 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 1>black son.</v>

523
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to court every stereotype on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

524
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.423
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom over compensated with me </v>

525
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.493
<v Speaker 1>tremendously because she understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she understood in her mind the </v>

526
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:41.470
<v Speaker 1>limitations that come with being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

527
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:44.640
<v Speaker 1>raising a man by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she overcompensated.</v>

528
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So whereas usually typically have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mama's boys who were just kind of like,</v>

529
00:22:47.891 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 1>mom does everything for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ain't did shit for me.</v>

530
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Go wash your own clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come here and go do shit.</v>

531
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:53.683
<v Speaker 1>Like everything she made me and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time I just thought she was just </v>

532
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.550
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not realizing,</v>

533
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was her overcompensating standpoint.</v>

534
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like I gotta make this through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to raise a man.</v>

535
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:05.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

536
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so she was trying to buck.</v>

537
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:11.290
<v Speaker 1>So I knew once I started getting into </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

538
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:11.661
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

539
00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:12.011
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

540
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Because the perception was black man </v>
<v Speaker 1>with gun gang banger.</v>

541
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

542
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.750
<v Speaker 1>she had some insecurities in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

543
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's gonna come a point where </v>

544
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna be able to control this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

545
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

546
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.383
<v Speaker 1>And so I didn't want to terrify her and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make her think that I was living in the </v>

547
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:30.820
<v Speaker 1>ferris lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she.</v>

548
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:31.743
<v Speaker 1>And it was almost in a way to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>her more than once to hide it from </v>

549
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 1>myself because I didn't want her to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she,</v>

550
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.853
<v Speaker 1>like she failed as a mother and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew if she saw the AK 47 that I had </v>

551
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:43.414
<v Speaker 1>hidden under my bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In her mind she knows nothing about </v>

552
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:46.364
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All she knows is what she sees in the </v>

553
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:48.554
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we all were like we touched upon </v>

554
00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:52.370
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that imagery is not positive.</v>

555
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 1>So she comes home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees ak 47 in bed.</v>

556
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

557
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:00.100
<v Speaker 1>my son is a gay man first instead under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad guy.</v>

558
00:24:00.101 --> 00:24:00.934
<v Speaker 1>You said in the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything you want tell here </v>

559
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.150
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

560
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I already did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this guy.</v>

561
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Both basketball fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to sleep with my basketball.</v>

562
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

565

<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>

566
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually working on trying to open </v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

567
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.470
<v Speaker 1>NRA annual meetings put together like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a charity.</v>

568
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Basketball it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're down.</v>

569
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Can I get into that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

570
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:26.871
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it,</v>

571
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:28.690
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never slept with my guns.</v>

572
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.743
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

573
00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

574
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.843
<v Speaker 1>so from that point when you started </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting okay with this and now you're </v>

575
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:39.760
<v Speaker 1>exploring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said intellectually,</v>

576
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long before you were really an </v>

577
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:43.604
<v Speaker 1>advocate for this stuff because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always sort of wanted to fight for </v>

578
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 1>something to be a theme with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A long time.</v>

579
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It was def that that's what I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

580
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:50.714
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be an advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be in the courtroom </v>

581
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:53.390
<v Speaker 1>defending people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

582
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 1>that was my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even to the detriment of my grades.</v>

583
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:57.044
<v Speaker 1>Like I focused more on like my mock </v>
<v Speaker 1>trial stuff when I was in law school </v>

584
00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:00.900
<v Speaker 1>than I did my actual work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

585
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 1>like schoolwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

586
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked being the voice for people.</v>

587
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:05.744
<v Speaker 1>I like being able to speak to people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can articulate certain things away that </v>

588
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.653
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never saw this going way that it </v>

589
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:13.154
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing exactly what I always </v>

590
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:16.214
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do.</v>

591
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for me with the gun thing,</v>

592
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I remember being in like I'd be in class</v>
<v Speaker 1>in law school and the way that they,</v>

593
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.480
<v Speaker 1>like the seats are staggered or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>stadium seats,</v>

594
00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:27.314
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm on my computer and you're </v>

595
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.503
<v Speaker 1>behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see what I'm doing on my </v>

596
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:35.261
<v Speaker 1>computer and I'd be in class in like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>researching guns and all man,</v>

597
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:37.911
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

598
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:38.744
<v Speaker 1>like people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is a lot of things that </v>

599
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:42.830
<v Speaker 1>were being said about me I didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about till later on,</v>

600
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.820
<v Speaker 1>people were concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

601
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I really like Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's like,</v>

602
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.780
<v Speaker 1>he's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

603
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

604
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.450
<v Speaker 1>and I get it if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not into that kind of thing,</v>

605
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't follow it.</v>

606
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.900
<v Speaker 1>The idea of being passionate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you perceive to be a tool that</v>

607
00:26:03.901 --> 00:26:05.690
<v Speaker 1>you use for killing people and only </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing people.</v>

608
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.410
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna seem new to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because I came to it so naturally,</v>

609
00:26:10.411 --> 00:26:14.660
<v Speaker 1>so organically without any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just made sense in my mind.</v>

610
00:26:14.661 --> 00:26:15.494
<v Speaker 1>I was so unapologetic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I got over being apologetic about </v>

611
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:21.350
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't push it in people's faces,</v>

612
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:22.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

613
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.470
<v Speaker 1>there was even a time like that's how my</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram got started was me separating.</v>

614
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 1>So the people who followed me up until </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point,</v>

615
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a girlfriend at the time was like,</v>

616
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of questions where people </v>

617
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.400
<v Speaker 1>can tend to tone down the gun stuff a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

618
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.700
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of an innocent thing,</v>

619
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but I never really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said,</v>

620
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

621
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.823
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to set up a whole nother </v>

622
00:26:44.581 --> 00:26:45.414
<v Speaker 1>page and now I'm just going to do all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good stuff I want to do on that </v>

623
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:47.520
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>

624
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

625
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:49.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now that's taken over.</v>

626
00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:50.454
<v Speaker 1>I don't even use the other one that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know if I remember the </v>

627
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 1>password,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>

628
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.073
<v Speaker 1>So from there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where things really started </v>

629
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:59.050
<v Speaker 1>taking off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with the and,</v>

630
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 1>and then when I started I started doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun reviews.</v>

631
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.150
<v Speaker 1>And so then from there when I got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political component of it,</v>

632
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:06.984
<v Speaker 1>then I started talking during my </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary and then that's when things </v>

633
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.070
<v Speaker 1>started really taking off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

634
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 1>so let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do gun one on one with all the</v>

635
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:15.414
<v Speaker 1>things that we should know about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I want to do the most common </v>

636
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.033
<v Speaker 1>misconceptions about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think part of the issue right </v>

637
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 1>now is every time something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time there's a shooting,</v>

638
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 1>half the people don't know anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about guns.</v>

639
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:29.214
<v Speaker 1>On one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the people then give you all of </v>

640
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:32.430
<v Speaker 1>those misconceptions.</v>

641
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.293
<v Speaker 1>It gets confusing for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even the people who I generally </v>

642
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

643
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

644
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So I want to do a video with you right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

645
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.503
<v Speaker 1>Every time one of these incidences </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and someone starts asking me </v>

646
00:27:46.381 --> 00:27:47.910
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking me that I want to go,</v>

647
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I've got the thing that I can point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the answers.</v>

648
00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So let's do gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What on what?</v>

649
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.830
<v Speaker 1>What do we need to know about guns are </v>
<v Speaker 1>first and foremost,</v>

650
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.320
<v Speaker 1>ar does not stand for assault rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they say ar 15,</v>

651
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 1>that's not assault rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not mean assault rifle.</v>

652
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 1>And the assault rifle is a gun that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully automatic,</v>

653
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means I pulled the trigger,</v>

654
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I hold it back and an expense all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ammunition in the magazine.</v>

655
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's Jesse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ventura and Predator.</v>

656
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.633
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

657
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.473
<v Speaker 1>It's a great gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

658
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.453
<v Speaker 1>Love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can argue that not going to side with </v>

659
00:28:15.651 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 1>my known again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

660
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.980
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's automatic.</v>

661
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 1>You just hold it down and down and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>will fire every round,</v>

662
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequently until it's completely out.</v>

663
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.953
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

664
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.580
<v Speaker 1>And does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at a very high rate of speed.</v>

665
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody automatic.</v>

666
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.353
<v Speaker 1>So now there's been this thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people conflate this or use somebody </v>

667
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:36.654
<v Speaker 1>automatic as a kind of a hyperbolic way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of characterizing guns as death killing </v>

668
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:41.724
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

669
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Virtually every modern gun is </v>
<v Speaker 1>semiautomatic.</v>

670
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.270
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is one press of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger,</v>

671
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 1>one bullet versus holding the trigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>down once and getting all the bullets.</v>

672
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:52.763
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a great distinction out there </v>

673
00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:54.534
<v Speaker 1>because often when this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see people saying we have to band </v>

674
00:28:57.211 --> 00:29:00.420
<v Speaker 1>semiautomatics semiautomatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's virtually every month.</v>

675
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.823
<v Speaker 1>He's just because all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only difference between that and a </v>

676
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.240
<v Speaker 1>what I guess fully automatic stuff.</v>

677
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Well what's one that you're just loading</v>
<v Speaker 1>one bullet in that.</v>

678
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be a bolt action.</v>

679
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

680
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.573
<v Speaker 1>So there's fully automatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semi automatic and Bolt Action Bolt </v>

681
00:29:16.881 --> 00:29:18.830
<v Speaker 1>action more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more like to like,</v>

682
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.953
<v Speaker 1>like hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right or high high precision shooting </v>

683
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.443
<v Speaker 1>and it's a bolt because it allows you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build a gun up in such a way where you </v>

684
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.193
<v Speaker 1>at the tighter constraints within a gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>and allows you to be more accurate </v>

685
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.770
<v Speaker 1>without certain mechanism moving back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth causing.</v>

686
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Throwing off the accuracy of the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you would say then that when with all</v>

687
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:42.580
<v Speaker 1>of these people come out and say we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to band semiautomatics and that they are</v>

688
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:43.414
<v Speaker 1>actually just flat out confused or </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionally conflating or a </v>

689
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.230
<v Speaker 1>obfuscating what the truth is related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

690
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

691
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.433
<v Speaker 1>And so it's either they're confused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ignorant or they're doing a </v>

692
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 1>purposeful that you just stated.</v>

693
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is the.</v>

694
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.170
<v Speaker 1>So let's do some nra stuff while we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we're doing this,</v>

695
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.750
<v Speaker 1>what is the NRA stance on automatics </v>
<v Speaker 1>just being able to hold an shoot.</v>

696
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.953
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's currently regulated is the </v>

697
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:08.014
<v Speaker 1>way it stands right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like in order to get an </v>

698
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 1>automatic gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain process you have to go</v>

699
00:30:12.251 --> 00:30:13.084
<v Speaker 1>through in order to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been that way for a very long </v>

700
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:20.710
<v Speaker 1>time now and that's been that it exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it does now.</v>

701
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.413
<v Speaker 1>And that's essentially where the stance </v>
<v Speaker 1>is with respect to fully automatic </v>

702
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.183
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are people using fully automatic </v>

703
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 1>guns for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>

704
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 1>because I think this is where you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear people go,</v>

705
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:33.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one needs an automatic to see.</v>

706
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:34.444
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea of putting it under the </v>

707
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 1>guise of needing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

708
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.933
<v Speaker 1>their name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another right where we use that same </v>

709
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:43.200
<v Speaker 1>standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

710
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.203
<v Speaker 1>begs the question.</v>

711
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

712
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.833
<v Speaker 1>you haven't fully automatic gun and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some automatic gun shot bolt </v>

713
00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:49.534
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different reasons why you </v>

714
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:53.530
<v Speaker 1>would want each of these guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can delve into that.</v>

715
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 1>But then that starts getting into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very nerdy side of firearm ownership.</v>

716
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Whether enthusiasm aspect of that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it,</v>

717
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 1>it's understanding tactically why you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would want certain things.</v>

718
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not personally,</v>

719
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully automatic gun personally.</v>

720
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.613
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see that as a significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger above and beyond say owning a </v>

721
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:17.870
<v Speaker 1>nuclear suitcase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

722
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.740
<v Speaker 1>So people tried to make that absurd </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument to me before.</v>

723
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:21.574
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then why don't you read a lot and </v>

724
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.403
<v Speaker 1>well that's because there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cost benefit ratio that </v>

725
00:31:24.971 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

726
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 1>That you just inherently self </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>

727
00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:31.893
<v Speaker 1>So how is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that protecting you in any way </v>

728
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:35.620
<v Speaker 1>from the very thing that you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be taking yourself against?</v>

729
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there should be a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold to be able to get an automatic</v>

730
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 1>than some of the other records you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>

731
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Me Personally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Threshold in what respect?</v>

732
00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:48.511
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of either hire back graded</v>
<v Speaker 1>background checks or references.</v>

733
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So talking about background checks for a</v>

734
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:52.540
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this idea,</v>

735
00:31:52.541 --> 00:31:55.090
<v Speaker 1>this notion that we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>background checks for guns.</v>

736
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing is we,</v>

737
00:31:58.391 --> 00:31:59.224
<v Speaker 1>in the gun community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become become a victim of </v>

738
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:01.294
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is people think </v>

739
00:32:03.401 --> 00:32:05.830
<v Speaker 1>that just because I can go into a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I really wanted to,</v>

740
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:06.723
<v Speaker 1>I can go a gun store right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy a gun within two minutes just like </v>

741
00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:11.440
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

742
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've done all of the </v>

743
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 1>background and see that's the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

744
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm still going under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm undergoing the same processes.</v>

745
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 1>So I go into a store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find a gun.</v>

746
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I liked this gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say I want to buy this gun.</v>

747
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I fill out the 44,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a forum,</v>

748
00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 1>44 slash 73,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which asked me a series of questions.</v>

749
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:29.703
<v Speaker 1>Then they take that information and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>submit it to the FBI database and they </v>

750
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.633
<v Speaker 1>do a background check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happens instantly because </v>

751
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.753
<v Speaker 1>technology people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because there's a lot </v>

752
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:40.810
<v Speaker 1>of people who feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

753
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 1>undergo some type of CIA investigation </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I buy a gun.</v>

754
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.010
<v Speaker 1>The same people who also hate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

755
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.873
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they did the instant aspect of </v>

756
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:51.284
<v Speaker 1>the background check causes people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know very much about the process </v>

757
00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 1>that think that there isn't one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

758
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Just because I can buy the gun easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean it was done thoroughly.</v>

759
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I underwent the background check.</v>

760
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a system there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They checked it against the system.</v>

761
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.760
<v Speaker 1>If I don't have any felonies or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that prevents me from owning a firearm,</v>

762
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm allowed to buy the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

763
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:10.904
<v Speaker 1>So when people say there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no background checks and </v>

764
00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:16.680
<v Speaker 1>background checks aren't tight enough or</v>
<v Speaker 1>however you want to extrapolate that.</v>

765
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Is there any credence to any of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can.</v>

766
00:33:20.091 --> 00:33:21.710
<v Speaker 1>So now let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what you're,</v>

767
00:33:21.711 --> 00:33:24.290
<v Speaker 1>what you're kind of going into is </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal background checks,</v>

768
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they say universal back,</v>

769
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 1>now they do conflate these </v>
<v Speaker 1>terminologies.</v>

770
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:32.750
<v Speaker 1>There's universal background check is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very specific statement.</v>

771
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not like saying coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

772
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Because people here universal background</v>
<v Speaker 1>checks and all the.</v>

773
00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Here's the background check part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That universal means something.</v>

774
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.323
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement that every single </v>

775
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:45.770
<v Speaker 1>transaction you have to undergo a </v>
<v Speaker 1>background check,</v>

776
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 1>even private transactions.</v>

777
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now in California,</v>

778
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.930
<v Speaker 1>if I had a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

779
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I can bring a gun into California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't carry it.</v>

780
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:54.051
<v Speaker 1>But you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

781
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I like that gun.</v>

782
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 1>You have right one to buy it from you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

783
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't sell it to you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

784
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say,</v>

785
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.393
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

786
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.503
<v Speaker 1>When I get back to Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll transfer the gun to a gun store </v>

787
00:34:07.911 --> 00:34:08.744
<v Speaker 1>here in California if it's on a specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>list that allows you to actually own </v>

788
00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:13.400
<v Speaker 1>that gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

789
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Because California has the district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And then you would have to go to the gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>store and then buy it right now.</v>

791
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I decided to give you the gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

792
00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Privately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now in this room,</v>

793
00:34:29.411 --> 00:34:30.244
<v Speaker 1>no one else is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you went on and I saw the either </v>

794
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.133
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want me to shut the cameras and I </v>

795
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:38.170
<v Speaker 1>don't have any plans on going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sell you the gun.</v>

796
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:41.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then let's say you have the gun,</v>

797
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.980
<v Speaker 1>what is there to check against?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What databases did they check against to</v>

798
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 1>determine whether or not you got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>background check for that gun?</v>

799
00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just completely two issues right now,</v>

800
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.060
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if we did it on the dl there,</v>

801
00:34:52.061 --> 00:34:54.010
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way and that's what the whole</v>

802
00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:55.720
<v Speaker 1>concept of the universal background </v>
<v Speaker 1>check is.</v>

803
00:34:55.721 --> 00:34:59.230
<v Speaker 1>It is to require a background check for </v>
<v Speaker 1>every private transaction.</v>

804
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legally right now I can't do it,</v>

805
00:35:01.811 --> 00:35:02.644
<v Speaker 1>but like in Texas I can sell a gun to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and as long as I know he's not a </v>

806
00:35:06.761 --> 00:35:09.700
<v Speaker 1>prohibited person and I know he's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>felon,</v>

807
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I can sell him that gun.</v>

808
00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:13.923
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's completely legal with the </v>

809
00:35:15.671 --> 00:35:20.120
<v Speaker 1>universal background check idea suggests</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I should have actually,</v>

810
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.013
<v Speaker 1>he should be required to undergo a </v>
<v Speaker 1>background check before I can sell in </v>

811
00:35:22.781 --> 00:35:23.614
<v Speaker 1>that gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would mean you and he and I would </v>

812
00:35:25.061 --> 00:35:28.180
<v Speaker 1>have to go to a gun store and undergo a </v>
<v Speaker 1>background check.</v>

813
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.073
<v Speaker 1>Then he can go and buy the gun from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the problem with the way it is </v>

814
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:32.614
<v Speaker 1>currently saying in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you're describing that you just </v>

815
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.463
<v Speaker 1>would not know intentionally enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the person you were selling it to </v>

816
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 1>a potential?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

817
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.083
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason why I'm against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal background check is because </v>

818
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 1>there is no other way to enforce it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a national gun registry,</v>

819
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.413
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you have nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>check it against to say if a cop walks </v>

820
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 1>down the street sees you have a gun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

821
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 1>did you get a background check for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun?</v>

822
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's he going to prove otherwise?</v>

823
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Unless there's a national registry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there was,</v>

824
00:36:01.821 --> 00:36:02.654
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

825
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Or then let's have a national registry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

826
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.623
<v Speaker 1>because we've seen time and time again </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when the governments have a </v>

827
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:09.594
<v Speaker 1>national registered firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they subsequently use it to confiscate </v>

828
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:12.504
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is when you say that </v>

829
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.730
<v Speaker 1>they try to put the tin foil hat on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

830
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Except because what they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they envision is roaring truck,</v>

831
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.833
<v Speaker 1>black military trucks coming down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street pulling guns from people's </v>

832
00:36:26.491 --> 00:36:27.540
<v Speaker 1>houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

833
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not what happens or how they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

834
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.163
<v Speaker 1>It's constructive and then when you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential presidential candidates like </v>

835
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton suggesting we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>take apart,</v>

836
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 1>we should take up the Australia model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which did that very thing.</v>

837
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:40.943
<v Speaker 1>They use the national,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use a national gun registration to </v>

838
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:44.880
<v Speaker 1>tell people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

839
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 1>you need to turn in your guns.</v>

840
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a voluntary buyback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

841
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.020
<v Speaker 1>it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

842
00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a mandatory buyback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

843
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.560
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't sell your guns back,</v>

844
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.060
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to jail.</v>

845
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a confiscation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a constructive confiscation,</v>

846
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:02.124
<v Speaker 1>but compensation nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because they didn't roll the </v>

847
00:37:04.441 --> 00:37:05.274
<v Speaker 1>military trucks down the street and pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>them out of your house doesn't mean it </v>

848
00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 1>isn't confiscation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I'm.</v>

849
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm adamantly against universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>background checks unless you can </v>

850
00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:13.944
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate away from it for it to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>applied in such a way that would not </v>

851
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:17.394
<v Speaker 1>require a gun registry because I do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust my government not to exploit that </v>

852
00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:23.550
<v Speaker 1>registry in their favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

853
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 1>So how much of this then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've talked about it,</v>

854
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:29.510
<v Speaker 1>you said to me right before we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of a libertarian.</v>

855
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's exactly what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put words in your mouth.</v>

856
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.773
<v Speaker 1>How much of this does go back to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>states should be able to make the </v>

857
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:39.330
<v Speaker 1>decisions that they see fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

858
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I suspect you probably wouldn't be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrilled living in California other than</v>

859
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.480
<v Speaker 1>the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

860
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether the women.</v>

861
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food and texting.</v>

862
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>

863
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not complaining about that.</v>

864
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

865
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:57.120
<v Speaker 1>That's just it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

866
00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far those states' rights go from the</v>

867
00:37:58.551 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 1>standpoint of violating my second </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment.</v>

868
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

869
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I believe in states rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

870
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.593
<v Speaker 1>Them to point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You started violating my constitutional </v>

871
00:38:04.621 --> 00:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>ones and so when you have places like </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

872
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.130
<v Speaker 1>which I think I think I'm being </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently violated now,</v>

873
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I can't carry my gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the difference I can take?</v>

874
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I can take my car with my Texas license </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drive it right into California.</v>

875
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:20.963
<v Speaker 1>No one has a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can drive up and down these roads and </v>

876
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.380
<v Speaker 1>as fast as I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as recklessly as I want.</v>

877
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be illegal,</v>

878
00:38:26.281 --> 00:38:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but I can still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that potentially to do it,</v>

879
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:29.124
<v Speaker 1>but yet I can't carry the thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry to protect my life with the same </v>

880
00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:34.614
<v Speaker 1>license.</v>

881
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.373
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like am I any in any less danger here </v>

882
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.240
<v Speaker 1>than I would be in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anything I can make the argument that</v>

883
00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:44.074
<v Speaker 1>I'm more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more danger for me here in that </v>

884
00:38:45.431 --> 00:38:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the area very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a weird way,</v>

885
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:49.720
<v Speaker 1>you're actually making a non states' </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights argument here,</v>

886
00:38:49.721 --> 00:38:50.554
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're saying you want the </v>

887
00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 1>same thing everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a states' rights argument.</v>

888
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm saying,</v>

889
00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.673
<v Speaker 1>but that's under the guise of me feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me not being able to carry his </v>

890
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.180
<v Speaker 1>violation of my constitutional right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

891
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.133
<v Speaker 1>Because there's rights doesn't allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to violate those constitutional </v>

892
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 1>rights and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the argument I'm making now.</v>

893
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.683
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult because when you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the idea of having a </v>

894
00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 1>uniform like concealed carry platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

895
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Where one license allows you to carry a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun everywhere,</v>

896
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

897
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Then you start getting into the weeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

898
00:39:22.241 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's violating states rights,</v>

899
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.920
<v Speaker 1>but that's only if you don't see my </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to carry your firearm as a,</v>

900
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

901
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.813
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ability to carry a firearm as a </v>

902
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:32.030
<v Speaker 1>violation of my constitutional rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

903
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.883
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting philosophical place </v>

904
00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:34.984
<v Speaker 1>to talk because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just depends where you start because </v>

905
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:39.450
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm definitely a states' </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights guy,</v>

906
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I hear what you say there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other hand,</v>

907
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 1>as a state's rights guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

908
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:48.100
<v Speaker 1>if a state wants to have stricter laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're a big gun guy,</v>

909
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:48.934
<v Speaker 1>then you actually are allowed to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of it as I would say for </v>

910
00:39:51.341 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 1>virtually every other situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of shitty.</v>

911
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel great to have to leave a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place that you want to be at,</v>

912
00:39:56.891 --> 00:39:57.724
<v Speaker 1>but if they are doing things as part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their state experiment that you don't </v>

913
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:03.370
<v Speaker 1>like well on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on you to get going.</v>

914
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that same state creates a law </v>

915
00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 1>that violates my right to privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

916
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Well we have constitutional rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>superseded.</v>

917
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get,</v>

918
00:40:11.981 --> 00:40:12.814
<v Speaker 1>I get nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we missing anything else on the </v>

919
00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Speaker 1>technical front because we did that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well.</v>

920
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.543
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we will see a from a mechanical</v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint just from a mechanical </v>

921
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 1>standpoint or just any of the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we use related to this.</v>

922
00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

923
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:28.120
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then of course there's,</v>

924
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 1>some people can say it's trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say it's not.</v>

925
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.160
<v Speaker 1>So the magazine versus clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general terms.</v>

926
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Actually it's called the magazine a clip</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an actual thing.</v>

927
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:41.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just different from a magazine but </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of slightly trivial,</v>

928
00:40:41.201 --> 00:40:42.034
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does typically kind of expose people </v>

929
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:45.394
<v Speaker 1>who don't really know much about guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say clip versus magazine </v>

930
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.220
<v Speaker 1>because the proper terminology would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine.</v>

931
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as any other mechanical </v>

932
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 1>components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

933
00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.830
<v Speaker 1>what do I need to know about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine?</v>

934
00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just terminology.</v>

935
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.550
<v Speaker 1>It is semantics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

936
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.523
<v Speaker 1>Get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't always go about correcting </v>

937
00:41:02.741 --> 00:41:05.780
<v Speaker 1>people because I felt like it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>creates it.</v>

938
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:10.450
<v Speaker 1>It kind of makes me look like an ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why we're doing this.</v>

939
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:11.463
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest thing is just the assault </v>

940
00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:15.700
<v Speaker 1>weapon thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

941
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Because the Ar 15 is the civilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon.</v>

942
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.350
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's designated.</v>

943
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.400
<v Speaker 1>The biggest difference between an ar 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an assault rifle is that the assault</v>

944
00:41:26.801 --> 00:41:29.350
<v Speaker 1>rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully automatic and they are 15,</v>

945
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.393
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest distinction between </v>

946
00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:33.770
<v Speaker 1>the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

947
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.570
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can make the argument.</v>

948
00:41:35.571 --> 00:41:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Well that's some very minor distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

949
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people who make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

950
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.633
<v Speaker 1>but I don't look at the Ar 15 any </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently than I look at the handgun </v>

951
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.570
<v Speaker 1>in that sense.</v>

952
00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.403
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time when one of these happens </v>

953
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 1>and we hear the Ar 15 is a weapon of war</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so were handguns,</v>

954
00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.423
<v Speaker 1>you would basically put the Ar 15 of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>handgun in the same categories as </v>

955
00:41:57.051 --> 00:41:58.090
<v Speaker 1>pulling ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

956
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:59.230
<v Speaker 1>she even wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

957
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.970
<v Speaker 1>So that would not be categorized as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a weapon of war will see that.</v>

958
00:42:02.971 --> 00:42:07.110
<v Speaker 1>See that estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that terminology is designed to,</v>

959
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate the emotions of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know anything about guns.</v>

960
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.573
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know anything about </v>

961
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 1>firearms and you hear he used a weapon </v>
<v Speaker 1>of war,</v>

962
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.900
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking our guns or weapons</v>
<v Speaker 1>of war,</v>

963
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:22.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So words can be weapons.</v>

964
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

965
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:25.184
<v Speaker 1>but what that does mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they understand language very well </v>

966
00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:33.140
<v Speaker 1>and they liked our unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of the,</v>

967
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:35.323
<v Speaker 1>I call it the anti gun side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I things they understand the use of </v>

968
00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:41.450
<v Speaker 1>language very well and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they confuse it purposely.</v>

969
00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear someone who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know anything about firearms,</v>

970
00:42:43.821 --> 00:42:44.654
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

971
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.870
<v Speaker 1>if I'm already kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little scared of firearms and then</v>

972
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:48.704
<v Speaker 1>I hear he used a weapon of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What image comes up in your mind at </v>

973
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Rambo,</v>

974
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:56.343
<v Speaker 1>he's running down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just going crazy and that's </v>

975
00:42:57.861 --> 00:42:58.694
<v Speaker 1>exactly what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could do the same thing with a </v>

976
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.160
<v Speaker 1>handgun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the biggest thing that I like to,</v>

977
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.890
<v Speaker 1>when I'm having these conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's,</v>

978
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:07.503
<v Speaker 1>you're going to walk away with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to walk away with two with </v>

979
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.673
<v Speaker 1>two points of two trains of thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm even going to get you to admit you </v>

980
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:16.841
<v Speaker 1>just want to ban all guns or you can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>my perspective because if you're,</v>

981
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:18.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

982
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 1>we need to get rid of all the assault </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons as they,</v>

983
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.480
<v Speaker 1>as they understand them to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially a fifteens,</v>

984
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 1>but now it's actually become even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader.</v>

985
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Like we need to get rid of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>semiautomatic weapons right now.</v>

986
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:30.913
<v Speaker 1>Virtually every modern gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say they want to ban Ar </v>

987
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:38.510
<v Speaker 1>fifteens air 15th rifles aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>used like the,</v>

988
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:39.344
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the percentage that rifles are used in </v>

989
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.490
<v Speaker 1>actual shootings is so low and marginal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

990
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 1>it's unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then why are we focusing on that?</v>

991
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:51.080
<v Speaker 1>But okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then what are most shootings?</v>

992
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Our handguns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

993
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.143
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we get rid of that and we got rid </v>

994
00:43:55.941 --> 00:43:56.774
<v Speaker 1>of Ar for teens and then we have another</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting happened because the army was </v>

995
00:43:59.221 --> 00:44:00.054
<v Speaker 1>deadliest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mass shooting was Virginia Tech and he </v>

996
00:44:01.971 --> 00:44:02.804
<v Speaker 1>used the hangup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens if that happens </v>

997
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:07.850
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what are you going to ban you?</v>

998
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.700
<v Speaker 1>You're going to abandon the hangup and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you're stuck.</v>

999
00:44:10.701 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Having to confront the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1000
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.453
<v Speaker 1>either you really just want to ban all </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns or you understand that the </v>

1001
00:44:16.431 --> 00:44:18.800
<v Speaker 1>distinction is irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1002
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.860
<v Speaker 1>With God to get to the absolute point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue and why these things are happening</v>

1003
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and focusing on the gun is doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disservice to the conversation.</v>

1004
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:28.993
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like I'm just utilizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using the bigger issue as a </v>

1005
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:32.034
<v Speaker 1>scapegoat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality if you really sit down </v>

1006
00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:35.250
<v Speaker 1>and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1007
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:36.923
<v Speaker 1>We have over 300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to 400 million guns in this </v>

1008
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:39.564
<v Speaker 1>country and not going anywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that you've got to then </v>

1009
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.240
<v Speaker 1>sit down and say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1010
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:46.913
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to try to fix this issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gun violence or just violence in </v>

1011
00:44:50.131 --> 00:44:50.964
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get to the root of the </v>

1012
00:44:52.131 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 1>issue of why people are doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then understanding that.</v>

1013
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.633
<v Speaker 1>Staying within the context of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to understand well in the </v>

1014
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:00.744
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have to protect myself and </v>

1015
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:03.624
<v Speaker 1>because people are still gonna be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get their hands on guns whether </v>

1016
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:06.923
<v Speaker 1>illegal or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and use them to commit crimes and </v>

1017
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:10.260
<v Speaker 1>the bread and people's lives.</v>

1018
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:11.783
<v Speaker 1>I've got to be put in a situation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend against that so you can bend all </v>

1019
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:17.010
<v Speaker 1>the outfit teams you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean it's going to stop somebody</v>

1020
00:45:17.011 --> 00:45:19.260
<v Speaker 1>from getting one on the black market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

1021
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.140
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't run from the fact that the ar 15</v>

1022
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:26.170
<v Speaker 1>is a more powerful platform that I agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with and I don't think it.</v>

1023
00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.053
<v Speaker 1>I don't run from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be people on who we </v>

1024
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.910
<v Speaker 1>were going to be mad at me for saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1025
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.043
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why the run from it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the very reason why I </v>

1026
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 1>want an ar 15 when it comes to defending</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

1027
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be a fair fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

1028
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.313
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to confront someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an ar 15 with a handgun if I don't </v>

1029
00:45:42.691 --> 00:45:45.150
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you come in my house,</v>

1030
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not grabbing a handgun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am grabbing an arm,</v>

1031
00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.730
<v Speaker 2>see we have this strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when people will say,</v>

1032
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:53.460
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the second amendment says the right</v>

1033
00:45:53.461 --> 00:45:55.620
<v Speaker 2>to bear arms and then they'll put up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture of,</v>

1034
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the type of arms that existed way back </v>

1035
00:45:58.081 --> 00:45:58.914
<v Speaker 2>when and it's like well then we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the right to that because that's </v>

1036
00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 2>what they were talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is so disingenuous.</v>

1037
00:46:04.021 --> 00:46:04.854
<v Speaker 2>Very disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they were also talking about </v>

1038
00:46:06.871 --> 00:46:07.704
<v Speaker 2>why you should be able to form a militia</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like the thing that we'd be </v>

1039
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:11.424
<v Speaker 2>fighting against now has a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>power and it doesn't mean that just </v>

1040
00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:16.320
<v Speaker 2>because you have some guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to stop the guys</v>

1041
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:18.030
<v Speaker 2>in the black trucks as you talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

1042
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.163
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you could defend yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit longer and who knows what </v>

1043
00:46:22.141 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 2>happens with a little bit of time.</v>

1044
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.583
<v Speaker 1>I mean fruit and be real with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still fighting in Afghanistan </v>

1045
00:46:26.691 --> 00:46:28.900
<v Speaker 1>and those guys over there just using AK </v>
<v Speaker 1>$47.</v>

1046
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.733
<v Speaker 1>You get what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like we can't just because we're </v>

1047
00:46:32.661 --> 00:46:34.820
<v Speaker 1>going to lose something that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie down and do it,</v>

1048
00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>

1049
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.250
<v Speaker 1>in that the whole notion of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah man,</v>

1050
00:46:40.251 --> 00:46:41.084
<v Speaker 1>I just lost my train of thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of owning firearms to combat </v>

1051
00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.270
<v Speaker 1>the government and they think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous,</v>

1052
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:52.460
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask the people in Venezuela,</v>

1053
00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.560
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are now the people,</v>

1054
00:46:56.561 --> 00:46:57.394
<v Speaker 2>at least in this current moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who say that the government </v>

1055
00:46:59.591 --> 00:47:01.090
<v Speaker 2>is run by Orange Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1056
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.160
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really well.</v>

1057
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Well this is a good spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think changed some minds and as I said</v>

1058
00:47:06.971 --> 00:47:11.620
<v Speaker 2>to you before we sat down and I've never</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered myself a gun person per se.</v>

1059
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.751
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in.</v>

1060
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm always interested in talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1061
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.113
<v Speaker 2>but I do find myself now more pro gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not even the right phrase </v>

1062
00:47:19.631 --> 00:47:22.280
<v Speaker 2>to say that I've ever been in my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then.</v>

1063
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.213
<v Speaker 2>But for me it has more to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really understanding what rights are </v>

1064
00:47:27.401 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 2>in a much clearer way and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I want</v>

1065
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.690
<v Speaker 1>the government to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1066
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:34.360
<v Speaker 1>and once you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

1067
00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:36.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1068
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.260
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to take other positions.</v>

1069
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:40.183
<v Speaker 1>It is weakened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there anything to you that when </v>

1070
00:47:42.021 --> 00:47:45.680
<v Speaker 1>they always say sensible gun control and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll always see the pro gun,</v>

1071
00:47:45.681 --> 00:47:46.820
<v Speaker 1>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1072
00:47:46.821 --> 00:47:47.654
<v Speaker 1>the people that always say that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what they're talking about </v>

1073
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.350
<v Speaker 1>now I sense you're probably in that spot</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

1074
00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 1>You were just saying that they do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

1075
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sensible gun control.</v>

1076
00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time when people say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually advocate things,</v>

1077
00:47:58.161 --> 00:48:02.900
<v Speaker 1>we already had background checks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things of that nature.</v>

1078
00:48:02.901 --> 00:48:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you like,</v>

1079
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:06.480
<v Speaker 1>and you have other language like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>loop,</v>

1080
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:07.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gun show gun,</v>

1081
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:09.080
<v Speaker 1>your gun show loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1082
00:48:09.081 --> 00:48:10.940
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a loophole.</v>

1083
00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.230
<v Speaker 1>All the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that is,</v>

1084
00:48:12.231 --> 00:48:15.050
<v Speaker 1>is a private transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all that is.</v>

1085
00:48:15.051 --> 00:48:15.884
<v Speaker 1>And it's just happening happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just so happened to happen at a gun </v>

1086
00:48:18.321 --> 00:48:18.710
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1087
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:21.620
<v Speaker 1>If you bought a gun from an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealer at a gun show,</v>

1088
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you still have to undergo a background </v>
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

1089
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Speaker 1>So the when they say loophole with </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is that if you are at a gun show,</v>

1090
00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you're not a dealer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually sell that gun at the.</v>

1091
00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.293
<v Speaker 1>If you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one person's not a prohibited </v>

1092
00:48:36.651 --> 00:48:39.610
<v Speaker 1>possessor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are from the same state then?</v>

1093
00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:40.431
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they.</v>

1094
00:48:40.431 --> 00:48:42.380
<v Speaker 1>If there's nothing that precludes them </v>
<v Speaker 1>from owning a firearm,</v>

1095
00:48:42.381 --> 00:48:45.500
<v Speaker 1>legally I can sell them a gun at a gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1096
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:46.423
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the only slippery part of that is </v>

1097
00:48:48.291 --> 00:48:49.124
<v Speaker 1>what we talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you just may not know all the </v>

1098
00:48:50.601 --> 00:48:52.640
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a,</v>

1099
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:53.503
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's a little bit of a gray </v>

1100
00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:55.664
<v Speaker 1>area and that one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a fair in terms of the </v>

1101
00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.830
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds that you're sort of taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's word for it at that point.</v>

1102
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.020
<v Speaker 1>When you guys meet somebody that day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1103
00:49:03.021 --> 00:49:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to buy that gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say to that,</v>

1104
00:49:04.851 --> 00:49:06.670
<v Speaker 1>you asked them all the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

1105
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.010
<v Speaker 1>They could be lying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just.</v>

1106
00:49:10.011 --> 00:49:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then that sold in the way.</v>

1107
00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:15.740
<v Speaker 1>The response that they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a universal background check,</v>

1108
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.050
<v Speaker 1>but as I pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

1109
00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:18.973
<v Speaker 1>how do you enforce it without a national</v>
<v Speaker 1>registry and then with that national </v>

1110
00:49:21.981 --> 00:49:24.350
<v Speaker 1>registry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with the national registry,</v>

1111
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:26.750
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't stop anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1112
00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.231
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1113
00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:28.064
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to go down this road of just </v>

1114
00:49:30.201 --> 00:49:31.970
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do things to make ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel better,</v>

1115
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.193
<v Speaker 1>but in reality name one mass shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been prevented with a </v>

1116
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.140
<v Speaker 1>universal background check.</v>

1117
00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.040
<v Speaker 3>No one.</v>

1118
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Because even the people who had gone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

1119
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.410
<v Speaker 1>supposed to have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got them illegally.</v>

1120
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:47.873
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't because there wasn't a </v>

1121
00:49:48.481 --> 00:49:50.680
<v Speaker 1>universal background check that stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from getting,</v>

1122
00:49:50.681 --> 00:49:52.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

1123
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.630
<v Speaker 1>So I have to so I have to ask the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1124
00:49:54.631 --> 00:49:55.464
<v Speaker 1>I go then why are we doing this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than just to make ourselves feel better </v>

1125
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.650
<v Speaker 1>because it's literally doing nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1126
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.570
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why like the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>who bought and sold the gun privately at</v>

1127
00:50:06.571 --> 00:50:07.404
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a gun show could have done that in </v>

1128
00:50:09.871 --> 00:50:12.840
<v Speaker 1>the parking lot of the gun show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have done it at their house before</v>

1129
00:50:12.841 --> 00:50:14.760
<v Speaker 1>going to the gun show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get what I'm saying?</v>

1130
00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:15.973
<v Speaker 1>But what it does is when you frame it </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the context of the gun show </v>

1131
00:50:18.721 --> 00:50:19.554
<v Speaker 1>loophole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it seem like it's this bizarre </v>

1132
00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:24.480
<v Speaker 1>where everyone comes there together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sells illegal guns.</v>

1133
00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the image that's created in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

1134
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Like it's barter town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1135
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Like they feed on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made on the ignorance of people,</v>

1136
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're not.</v>

1137
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that much about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's one of those things.</v>

1138
00:50:36.001 --> 00:50:37.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1139
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a lot about a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people may know a lot about.</v>

1140
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.833
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you tell me something and I'm not </v>

1141
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:45.920
<v Speaker 1>really researched and schooled on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

1142
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.530
<v Speaker 1>you could give me the beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty Kooky stuff.</v>

1143
00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1144
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.780
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I'm talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1145
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:53.540
<v Speaker 1>that's what you consistently see every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time we talk about this.</v>

1146
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:54.374
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this other piece of it where </v>

1147
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like every time a shooting happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1148
00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 1>there's this pile on we now we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about it.</v>

1149
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:01.604
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this other part of us </v>

1150
00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:06.970
<v Speaker 1>where it's because we go from one crisis</v>
<v Speaker 1>to another that there's never read it.</v>

1151
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never really have time to really ever</v>

1152
00:51:10.551 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 1>fully unpack any of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1153
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I think there's moments like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on a national level,</v>

1154
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.830
<v Speaker 1>we're not particularly good at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>

1155
00:51:17.831 --> 00:51:18.664
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then what it does is just turns </v>

1156
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:20.960
<v Speaker 1>into a political sparring match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:22.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean right after the last shooting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1158
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:27.310
<v Speaker 1>when Dana Lotion and Rubio are on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN town hall and it was,</v>

1159
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the gladiatorial fests,</v>

1160
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a disaster.</v>

1161
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was everything I hate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable news.</v>

1162
00:51:32.751 --> 00:51:33.584
<v Speaker 1>It was everything I hate about just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick bites of all of this and </v>

1163
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:39.260
<v Speaker 1>flashiness and just who can we take out </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

1164
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.090
<v Speaker 1>It was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1165
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.593
<v Speaker 1>and I sat and I pointed this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we have a real honest </v>

1166
00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:50.591
<v Speaker 1>conversation when they try to paint </v>
<v Speaker 1>program people as crazy when we say no,</v>

1167
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:53.930
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate goal is to ban guns.</v>

1168
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.213
<v Speaker 1>But then I can watch cnn live town hall </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we suggest you do realize banding </v>

1169
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:03.014
<v Speaker 1>on somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of guns is essentially </v>

1170
00:52:03.591 --> 00:52:08.591
<v Speaker 1>banning all guns and the entire stadium </v>
<v Speaker 1>erupts in applause and cheers.</v>

1171
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it goes,</v>

1172
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rubio said exactly what you said.</v>

1173
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And they started cheering even even when</v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted with the core,</v>

1174
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 1>because Rubio said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1175
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.013
<v Speaker 1>you want to bet on somebody that had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun to your me kitchen really quickly </v>

1176
00:52:22.761 --> 00:52:24.830
<v Speaker 1>and tell you that it's virtually all </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

1177
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.710
<v Speaker 1>So even when he corrected them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't.</v>

1178
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:28.640
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

1179
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.653
<v Speaker 1>they can't claim they will be ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it because he just explained to them </v>

1180
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:35.290
<v Speaker 1>that needs banning virtually all guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they erupted.</v>

1181
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.060
<v Speaker 1>So it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1182
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:39.980
<v Speaker 1>so now you have all those programs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1183
00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.390
<v Speaker 1>we just going to go back to our client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no discussion.</v>

1184
00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Because while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we're trying to be fair,</v>

1185
00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:48.830
<v Speaker 1>you're ultimate goal is to try to ban </v>
<v Speaker 1>them all.</v>

1186
00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was that moment,</v>

1187
00:52:50.451 --> 00:52:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you remember this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the Parkland shooting,</v>

1188
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:56.470
<v Speaker 1>when they had the big rally and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the survivors got up there and said,</v>

1189
00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:58.340
<v Speaker 1>we're going to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the line?</v>

1190
00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the exact line where she</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1191
00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:01.064
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to come for the </v>

1192
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:03.343
<v Speaker 1>semiautomatics now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to come through </v>

1193
00:53:04.671 --> 00:53:06.600
<v Speaker 1>everything later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something to that effect them.</v>

1194
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm slightly butcher head,</v>

1195
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:09.290
<v Speaker 1>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1196
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:14.810
<v Speaker 1>now now you're flat out saying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just giving.</v>

1197
00:53:14.811 --> 00:53:17.180
<v Speaker 1>You're telling them now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could see why.</v>

1198
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:17.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1199
00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I see this with all my frustrations with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left all the time.</v>

1200
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:22.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like I know they're never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

1201
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it so consistently and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why I'm staking out some positions,</v>

1202
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.503
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of sucky to have to just be </v>

1203
00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:29.551
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1204
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:32.010
<v Speaker 1>the people that I'm fighting against so </v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>

1205
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 1>they're not dealing in the same world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm dealing in and I.</v>

1206
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.600
<v Speaker 1>and that makes it more important for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stake out a position.</v>

1207
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:40.703
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's most frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it is the way they'll color it in </v>

1208
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream media is that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable.</v>

1209
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.160
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to move on inch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've dug her heels in.</v>

1210
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 1>All we want is we don't care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1211
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.413
<v Speaker 1>And really what it is is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let you into my house and now you're </v>

1212
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:00.444
<v Speaker 1>trying to take my house from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So get out because that's essentially </v>

1213
00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:06.570
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll say,</v>

1214
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 1>well common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we hate that word.</v>

1215
00:54:08.701 --> 00:54:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Common sense because it cause it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous.</v>

1216
00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we need common sense measures after</v>

1217
00:54:13.991 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 1>a shooting in another shooting happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need more common sense measures.</v>

1218
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And another shooting happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need even more common sense measures.</v>

1219
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:22.943
<v Speaker 1>Windows commonsense mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped being common sense and just </v>

1220
00:54:24.751 --> 00:54:26.770
<v Speaker 1>intruding on my rights and I can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1221
00:54:26.771 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know my thing for guns to use,</v>

1222
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:29.580
<v Speaker 1>free speech to me.</v>

1223
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:33.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's like I can see this coming with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that give these guys took control.</v>

1224
00:54:33.091 --> 00:54:35.520
<v Speaker 1>You'd start seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we can have free speech,</v>

1225
00:54:35.521 --> 00:54:38.690
<v Speaker 1>but we need some common sense controls </v>
<v Speaker 1>around Greece,</v>

1226
00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.093
<v Speaker 1>so I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do understand the position that I </v>

1227
00:54:41.731 --> 00:54:43.020
<v Speaker 1>tell people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1228
00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 1>there are over 300 federal gun laws in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

1229
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:48.803
<v Speaker 1>I think we've been reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we were really truly being </v>

1230
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.273
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't have over 300 federal gun </v>

1231
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:57.270
<v Speaker 1>law and I can't even begin to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>how many we have on a state level.</v>

1232
00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's incredibly disingenuous to think</v>

1233
00:55:00.811 --> 00:55:01.644
<v Speaker 1>that we're just being hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard assets who don't want to move one </v>

1234
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 1>inch on the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1235
00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:09.810
<v Speaker 1>No one's saying it should be a free for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all where we're just handing out guns to</v>

1236
00:55:09.811 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 1>everyone like Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1237
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody has a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently with background checks.</v>

1238
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Now he's talking about universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>background checks.</v>

1239
00:55:17.071 --> 00:55:18.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But since nobody.</v>

1240
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Since they never want to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction,</v>

1241
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one ever knows that you can't,</v>

1242
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:23.790
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1243
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:26.370
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1244
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:27.204
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about gun free zones and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>begs the question is like what does </v>

1245
00:55:31.621 --> 00:55:32.454
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that sticker on when they're </v>

1246
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:33.953
<v Speaker 1>going to do for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I have to make like people don't </v>

1247
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:37.283
<v Speaker 1>really like to sympathize with gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>owners in a sense of like we all want </v>

1248
00:55:40.201 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 1>the same result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1249
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.160
<v Speaker 1>We want the killing to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want the violence to stop.</v>

1250
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Notice I said violence and killing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just gun violence,</v>

1251
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:48.414
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we can't just focus on gun </v>

1252
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:52.710
<v Speaker 1>violence because violence is violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However you die,</v>

1253
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:57.711
<v Speaker 1>you die and it's bad all the way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I have to make a decision about</v>

1254
00:55:57.811 --> 00:55:58.644
<v Speaker 1>whether or not I potentially break a law</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go into an establishment that may or </v>

1255
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 1>may not cause me to need my gun at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1256
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's messed up.</v>

1257
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.030
<v Speaker 1>And I know that there are a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who don't see it that way because</v>

1258
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:12.864
<v Speaker 1>they don't see value in the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment because they're not firearm </v>

1259
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:15.960
<v Speaker 1>owners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1260
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:16.973
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people who look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second amendment is useless because </v>

1261
00:56:19.141 --> 00:56:19.974
<v Speaker 1>they don't own firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you have a group of people who </v>

1262
00:56:21.991 --> 00:56:22.824
<v Speaker 1>understand the importance of it and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it fits into their lives and they </v>

1263
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:27.790
<v Speaker 1>understand that at the end of the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>when something happens,</v>

1264
00:56:27.791 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 1>the only person who's going to be there </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop it is you.</v>

1265
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.393
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just me trying to protect a </v>

1266
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 1>piece of metal because I just want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fun with my guns.</v>

1267
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much bigger than that.</v>

1268
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It's this idea that I have to rely on </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

1269
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:47.830
<v Speaker 1>You can tell me all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police are going to be there,</v>

1270
00:56:47.831 --> 00:56:51.070
<v Speaker 1>the police are going to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to be.</v>

1271
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:53.150
<v Speaker 1>They're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1272
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.390
<v Speaker 1>and then you think you named were at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkland.</v>

1273
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you,</v>

1274
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:01.180
<v Speaker 1>then you add kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family into the mix.</v>

1275
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 1>That ratchets it up to a whole nother </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1276
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:04.863
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the piece of this that just </v>

1277
00:57:05.981 --> 00:57:07.090
<v Speaker 1>sort of optics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1278
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every now and again you'll see a picture</v>

1279
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:12.370
<v Speaker 1>of like three dudes with big ass guns at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaa,</v>

1280
00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:14.890
<v Speaker 1>an open carry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know if I was,</v>

1281
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:19.090
<v Speaker 1>if I walked into Japan and three guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>came in with big ass guns on their back,</v>

1282
00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you can prototype notice why would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice?</v>

1283
00:57:22.181 --> 00:57:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And I probably leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably would,</v>

1284
00:57:24.611 --> 00:57:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1285
00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.441
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again I'm here,</v>

1286
00:57:26.441 --> 00:57:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm here in California where that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be so,</v>

1287
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:29.163
<v Speaker 1>so out of the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the person that's living in </v>

1288
00:57:32.321 --> 00:57:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>

1289
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 1>If I was in AAA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1290
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And three guys walking in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably would leave no one.</v>

1291
00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you just said there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that these guys are probably NRA</v>

1292
00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:44.440
<v Speaker 1>members and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as far as I know,</v>

1293
00:57:44.441 --> 00:57:46.760
<v Speaker 1>no NRA member has ever done a mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting know.</v>

1294
00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1295
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1296
00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you see this,</v>

1297
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:50.680
<v Speaker 1>all the celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>

1298
00:57:50.681 --> 00:57:51.514
<v Speaker 1>Ian Black light out on the show who's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this rampage telling everyone that you </v>

1299
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:54.814
<v Speaker 1>guys are terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really that you're part of a </v>

1300
00:57:56.381 --> 00:57:58.100
<v Speaker 1>terrorist organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1301
00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.953
<v Speaker 1>And so all the other 5 million members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is something about </v>

1302
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:03.940
<v Speaker 1>some of the optics of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1303
00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I would be nervous now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get your point would be,</v>

1304
00:58:06.521 --> 00:58:09.160
<v Speaker 1>well those guys are going to protect you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other guy walks in or whatever.</v>

1305
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:12.130
<v Speaker 1>And some of that may be feelings over </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts right there,</v>

1306
00:58:12.131 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just is.</v>

1307
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing about it that is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big debate within the gun,</v>

1308
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:17.223
<v Speaker 1>the gun community as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of open carry versus concealed </v>

1309
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:23.410
<v Speaker 1>carry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever open carry except for maybe</v>

1310
00:58:23.411 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 1>if I'm out hunting or I'm on the range </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1311
00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.200
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a personal decision.</v>

1312
00:58:29.201 --> 00:58:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm choosing my own for various reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1313
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:34.180
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I rather not have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

1314
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And tactically I liked the advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the element of surprise.</v>

1315
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:41.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't know I have a gun on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I had to use it,</v>

1316
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be reacting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1317
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going into a place to shoot it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1318
00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:47.810
<v Speaker 1>If somebody decides to come into a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot,</v>

1319
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:48.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be reacting to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need all the advantages I get from </v>

1320
00:58:51.221 --> 00:58:54.010
<v Speaker 1>my personal perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want the element of surprise.</v>

1321
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 1>There's some people who think only </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>

1322
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:57.423
<v Speaker 1>They feel like just the mere presence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gun is a deterrent from anyone who </v>

1323
00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:02.704
<v Speaker 1>wants to come in and do some bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if a guys casing out a couple of </v>

1324
00:59:04.271 --> 00:59:05.420
<v Speaker 1>stores in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then ecs,</v>

1325
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:09.460
<v Speaker 1>there are certain citizens in there with</v>
<v Speaker 1>long guns and some that have a hand guns</v>

1326
00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:11.620
<v Speaker 1>on the side of your hip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's a deterrent.</v>

1327
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:14.223
<v Speaker 1>I understand the alarm that people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily engage in interact </v>

1328
00:59:18.341 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Speaker 1>with fire arms get when they see people </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around with rifles.</v>

1329
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I've never been.</v>

1330
00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:24.074
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a couple of people in Texas do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and initially my gut reaction and </v>

1331
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll admit was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1332
00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.650
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now,</v>

1333
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm very versed firearms and I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun too.</v>

1334
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:38.890
<v Speaker 1>So at that point I actually almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome it and the reason why is because</v>

1335
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:43.340
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now get to see you attempt to do it.</v>

1336
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 1>You get what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a telegraph.</v>

1337
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:49.430
<v Speaker 1>They are in a unique case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1338
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm speaking from purely a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>preference,</v>

1339
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:53.913
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I getting on the whole for anyone </v>

1340
00:59:54.861 --> 00:59:56.540
<v Speaker 1>else or anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Personally,</v>

1341
00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I would rather like to know you have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right if I can see it,</v>

1342
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.753
<v Speaker 1>because then I know where to focus my </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention versus me kind of being alone </v>

1343
01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>to a state of complacency because of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>absence.</v>

1344
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.843
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden somebody stands</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and decides he wants to shoot the </v>

1345
01:00:09.561 --> 01:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>place up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1346
01:00:10.721 --> 01:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>and then I have to react to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1347
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tactics,</v>

1348
01:00:14.121 --> 01:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1349
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>that's personal preference in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>

1350
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:17.563
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do understand the alarm that somebody </v>

1351
01:00:18.971 --> 01:00:21.320
<v Speaker 1>who would have seen you three guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking into aaa with,</v>

1352
01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with rifles because it seems seemingly,</v>

1353
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>especially to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's a bit excessive.</v>

1354
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can conceal carry a rifle,</v>

1355
01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>I would because it's better at defending</v>
<v Speaker 1>me than a handgun was the only reason.</v>

1356
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:34.543
<v Speaker 1>The only reason I have a handgun it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's small enough for me to </v>

1357
01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>conceal and it allows me to live my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an uninterrupted.</v>

1358
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I'd walk around with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1359
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:43.124
<v Speaker 1>So we can't end without doing sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think would be the big question </v>

1360
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:46.933
<v Speaker 1>for everything we've talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hearing for someone that works with the </v>

1361
01:00:48.381 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>NRA and your show is on nitv and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1362
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>So what is going on in America right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be unique to our society?</v>

1363
01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.233
<v Speaker 1>We do have more shootings here than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think virtually all other western </v>

1364
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>nations combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1365
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1366
01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>For you to fact check me on that if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>butchered that one.</v>

1367
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>But it does seem it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if I'm slightly.</v>

1368
01:01:12.141 --> 01:01:12.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1369
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:13.240
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're good.</v>

1370
01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>It seems that there is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely happening here now.</v>

1371
01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:18.074
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that there's all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health issues and probably a </v>

1372
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:21.463
<v Speaker 1>prescription drugs and maybe non </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription drugs and all sorts of </v>

1373
01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

1374
01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>there were a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll try to.</v>

1375
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:28.214
<v Speaker 1>I've try to keep this as concise as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible because we are going to get </v>

1376
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>into weeds for a split second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got.</v>

1377
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about mass shootings,</v>

1378
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your schools,</v>

1379
01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>school districts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

1380
01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I recently just read a study from </v>
<v Speaker 1>northwestern university I'm not too long</v>

1381
01:01:39.111 --> 01:01:39.944
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which talked about comparing the number </v>

1382
01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>of school shootings back in the nineties</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus the versus today.</v>

1383
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.003
<v Speaker 1>And what they concluded essentially was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perception is that it's happening </v>

1384
01:01:49.941 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>more frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

1385
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>it's actually on par or even less now </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it was then.</v>

1386
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Now you can people who are going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1387
01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you possibly say that?</v>

1388
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a northwestern university.</v>

1389
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

1390
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the actual title of the</v>

1391
01:02:05.961 --> 01:02:06.794
<v Speaker 1>actual research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to grab it from you </v>

1392
01:02:08.331 --> 01:02:11.470
<v Speaker 1>after this guy's linked to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And absolutely.</v>

1393
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>So that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass shootings account for a very,</v>

1394
01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very marginal percentage of shootings in</v>

1395
01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start off with the overall.</v>

1396
01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>So 35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 to 36,000</v>

1397
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>people each year die from guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1398
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.153
<v Speaker 1>I didn't specify gun violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just guns because they don't do </v>

1399
01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll just say gun violence.</v>

1400
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 60 about 60 to 65 percent of those,</v>

1401
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>that 35,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicides.</v>

1402
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Now what I'm not saying is we don't care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about suicides.</v>

1403
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1404
01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:48.470
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the idea and the issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>of somebody shooting at me that's a.</v>

1405
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not Germane.</v>

1406
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>But then even still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make the argument,</v>

1407
01:02:52.471 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we had less guns,</v>

1408
01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>we'd have less suicides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also not true because our suicide</v>

1409
01:02:57.211 --> 01:02:59.610
<v Speaker 1>rate is on par with every other major </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1410
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>So if it was a case that the more guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

1411
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 1>the more suicides will you be leading </v>
<v Speaker 1>the charge?</v>

1412
01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:05.670
<v Speaker 1>We don't there where there's a will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a way.</v>

1413
01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:06.504
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even some of the more famous suicides </v>

1414
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>that we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't use guns.</v>

1415
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>So we sat that number aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge number,</v>

1416
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.780
<v Speaker 1>65 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's huge number out of 35,</v>

1417
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:16.614
<v Speaker 1>36,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have about one to three </v>

1418
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Speaker 1>percent which are justifiable homicides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that self defense,</v>

1419
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>that's including police shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals who are shooting at them,</v>

1420
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:29.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people who use guns in self defense,</v>

1421
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.233
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to set that aside because that's </v>

1422
01:03:32.461 --> 01:03:34.530
<v Speaker 1>not the issue we're trying to address.</v>

1423
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:35.723
<v Speaker 1>So it's at that number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then you have about five percent </v>

1424
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>which are accidental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1425
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Kid gets behind the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull triggers,</v>

1426
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely unfortunate.</v>

1427
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:46.703
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe personally half of that can </v>

1428
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.773
<v Speaker 1>easily be addressed with more education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we took the energy that we took </v>

1429
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.933
<v Speaker 1>that we we placed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm trying to vilify guns and have </v>

1430
01:03:59.161 --> 01:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>national campaigns teaching people about</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun safety,</v>

1431
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.653
<v Speaker 1>that we'll cut that number in half </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of these accidents easily </v>

1432
01:04:05.671 --> 01:04:07.230
<v Speaker 1>preventable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just people who have gone to</v>

1433
01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:08.064
<v Speaker 1>just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if we spend time educating those </v>

1434
01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:11.844
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we know what percentage of that </v>

1435
01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 1>subset is getting those guns legally or </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally?</v>

1436
01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Because I would imagine that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably illegal,</v>

1437
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.680
<v Speaker 1>which is why they don't know how to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gun in the first.</v>

1438
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:20.543
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to assume I have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer because I don't have that hard </v>

1439
01:04:23.101 --> 01:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

1440
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1441
01:04:24.481 --> 01:04:27.720
<v Speaker 1>and I would bet I do feel comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that as well.</v>

1442
01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1443
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 1>and so we take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accidents and set that aside,</v>

1444
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:39.530
<v Speaker 1>purely homicides were looking at around </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven to 10,000</v>

1445
01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>

1446
01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:47.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a different looking number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1447
01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.720
<v Speaker 1>When will be accounted for all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the context here with those,</v>

1448
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.780
<v Speaker 1>those other shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the vast majority,</v>

1449
01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:58.403
<v Speaker 1>I'd say close to 80 percent that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>read in a couple of articles of those </v>

1450
01:05:01.351 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>homicides are happening in the inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities of our country.</v>

1451
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then reasoning goes,</v>

1452
01:05:10.771 --> 01:05:11.604
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's look at those inner cities and </v>

1453
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the dynamics there,</v>

1454
01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:16.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have low jobs,</v>

1455
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.063
<v Speaker 1>lack of economic opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storied households and a narco economy </v>

1456
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:29.990
<v Speaker 1>that warrants that warrants but creates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessity for this type of violence.</v>

1457
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.273
<v Speaker 1>So if we dealt with the socioeconomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of what's going on in those </v>

1458
01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>areas right to we really have a gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

1459
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.593
<v Speaker 1>just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I know other communities filled </v>

1460
01:05:45.761 --> 01:05:47.440
<v Speaker 1>with black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have guns,</v>

1461
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the same level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence because I only say black people</v>

1462
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>because most people associate the inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>city with with black people.</v>

1463
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:54.004
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason why we had that high </v>

1464
01:05:56.351 --> 01:05:57.184
<v Speaker 1>level of concentration of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because of the conditions in those </v>

1465
01:05:59.111 --> 01:05:59.944
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then even within those communities </v>

1466
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:03.064
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of people in those </v>

1467
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:05.224
<v Speaker 1>committees are good people and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very minor group of people who are </v>

1468
01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 1>creating a large number of the violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1469
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's something to be said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we really have a gun problem or do we</v>

1470
01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:20.230
<v Speaker 1>have a social economic suicide problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country?</v>

1471
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Because at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this 35 to 36,000</v>

1472
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.920
<v Speaker 1>that people assuming is all gun violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>by way of homicides,</v>

1473
01:06:29.921 --> 01:06:31.570
<v Speaker 1>people shooting at other people to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1474
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:33.203
<v Speaker 1>It's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at closer to seven to </v>

1475
01:06:35.081 --> 01:06:36.100
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that.</v>

1476
01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.310
<v Speaker 1>So if you take those numbers and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare them other countries,</v>

1477
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:40.533
<v Speaker 1>then how does it look?</v>

1478
01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Could it be continued?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.733
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm so glad that we finally did </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and we will definitely do this </v>

1480
01:06:46.931 --> 01:06:47.764
<v Speaker 2>again because I absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This story and everything we've talked </v>

1481
01:06:50.291 --> 01:06:51.124
<v Speaker 2>about here is just going to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are the battles that we're </v>

1482
01:06:53.771 --> 01:06:54.604
<v Speaker 2>now fighting on many fronts related to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution and free speech and </v>

1483
01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:02.170
<v Speaker 2>free expression and your ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to own your life and all that stuff.</v>

1484
01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:04.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's all we ask is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a.</v>

1485
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.983
<v Speaker 2>let me see.</v>

1486
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll say one last thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1487
01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.960
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people.</v>

1488
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:09.570
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you feel the need to carry a gun?</v>

1489
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the chances of you needing to use</v>

1490
01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>that gun to protect yourself one </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

1491
01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>And the answer I have for that is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may be right.</v>

1492
01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.230
<v Speaker 1>The chance of me need to care to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually use my gun to defend myself.</v>

1493
01:07:22.231 --> 01:07:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe really slim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe one percent,</v>

1494
01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.340
<v Speaker 1>but if that one percent happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 100 percent of everything.</v>

1495
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.750
<v Speaker 1>The consequences are 100 percent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's so important.</v>

1496
01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1497
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you and to show you know,</v>

1498
01:07:36.601 --> 01:07:39.130
<v Speaker 2>you maybe we'll do this next time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we'll bring you on with someone on</v>

1499
01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:41.110
<v Speaker 2>some of the other side of the issues on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1500
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I will tell them what that conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds like.</v>

1501
01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>A plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
