1
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are back.</v>

2
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:33.591
<v Speaker 1>I jokingly said that we were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash the Internet and I'm pretty sure </v>

3
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 1>we crashed youtube literally out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every live stream we have ever done.</v>

4
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>We have never had an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened there.</v>

5
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:43.431
<v Speaker 1>I have conferred with these two fine men</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not willing to completely go </v>

6
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:47.931
<v Speaker 1>down the conspiracy theory yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to just recap what </v>

7
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>happened in 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

8
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first off,</v>

9
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro to my left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically,</v>

10
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson to my right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I believe that we are fully right now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea revolution.</v>

12
00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this for about 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

13
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>We'll try to recap a little bit of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we started with and then gets a similar </v>

14
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>all new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>as I've said to the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're welcome to talk directly to each</v>

16
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they have questions for me,</v>

17
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>we can add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no rules here,</v>

18
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>there are never rules in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but truly today,</v>

19
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>there are no rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that these guys are in the thick</v>

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>of something just tremendously important</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now in relevant.</v>

22
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's why they're blowing up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that they are.</v>

23
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to do some of that again.</v>

24
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Although you guys were both quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>eloquent the 10 minutes ago.</v>

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm idea revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that we are in an idea </v>

26
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>revolution right now?</v>

27
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I think's happening,</v>

28
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this accounts for the </v>

29
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 2>attractiveness of the content that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>put on Youtube.</v>

30
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:46.491
<v Speaker 2>So when Nisha darkness the death of God </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 150 years ago and his,</v>

31
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 2>he made three predictions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said people will be,</v>

32
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture will shape to the roots will</v>

33
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 2>become nihilistic or totalitarian in </v>
<v Speaker 2>response,</v>

34
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 2>or we'll invent our own values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

35
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Those were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were his three possibilities.</v>

36
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course we became not listed.</v>

37
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Can Totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian through the 20th century </v>

38
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 2>and many tens of millions of people died</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence,</v>

39
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 2>which Nietzsche also foretold </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>

40
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:19.881
<v Speaker 2>He said that 100 million people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>die because of the rise of communist </v>

41
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:19.881
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that in willpower.</v>

42
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 2>So then he predicted that while we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to invent our own values,</v>

43
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 2>but then the psychoanalysts came along </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>

44
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 2>well wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

45
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 2>You can't create your own values because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not mastering your own house.</v>

46
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 2>There are forces operating inside of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are autonomous.</v>

47
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And for Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were primarily biological forces,</v>

48
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 2>but young took that a step further and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

49
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 2>well wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Biology is a lot more sophisticated and </v>

50
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 2>complex than you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are symbolic forces at work.</v>

51
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 2>He thought of the archetypes has images </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the instincts,</v>

52
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the instincts were a lot more </v>

53
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.541
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated than people thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just an instinct to </v>

54
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.991
<v Speaker 2>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there's an instinct to </v>

55
00:02:59.991 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 2>operating properly that you walk up </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>

56
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>human hierarchies of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be something like that.</v>

57
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an archetype of the ideal.</v>

58
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you thought the gods didn't disappear.</v>

59
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 2>They went inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went into the psyche,</v>

60
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:17.491
<v Speaker 2>and so he dove down as far as he could </v>
<v Speaker 2>dive to find out what those eternal </v>

61
00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 2>images were and to bring them back up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surface.</v>

62
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I've been continuing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say in my lectures saying,</v>

63
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

64
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 2>there are elements to the ancient story </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are not only they're deeply correct</v>

65
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:35.191
<v Speaker 2>and you cannot live and you live in hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you know them.</v>

66
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the case.</v>

67
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>

68
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that's what is happening is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are starting to understand </v>

69
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.961
<v Speaker 2>that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's lives do have a transcendent </v>

70
00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:52.771
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most appropriate way of </v>

71
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:55.261
<v Speaker 2>looking at life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That our brains are in fact evolved to </v>

72
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 2>reveal that purpose to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I also believe.</v>

73
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I think the neuro neurological evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that regard is quite clear.</v>

74
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I hope.</v>

75
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're.</v>

76
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 2>We're at the end of postmodern despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm hoping.</v>

77
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're giving there is sort of a </v>

79
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.181
<v Speaker 1>realist version of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying these stories are needed </v>

80
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:18.890
<v Speaker 1>for a very real way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect you basically agree with.</v>

81
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's what's fascinating about this is </v>

82
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.570
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jordan,</v>

83
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.720
<v Speaker 3>maybe closer to aristotle and Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that we almost have a </v>

84
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.770
<v Speaker 3>platonic verses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aristotelian argument going on here </v>

85
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.920
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about is the idea that if we dig</v>

86
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:35.160
<v Speaker 3>down deep enough into our biology's and </v>
<v Speaker 3>into our neural networks,</v>

87
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:40.161
<v Speaker 3>what we find is a common set of shared </v>
<v Speaker 3>values that if you refuse to acknowledge</v>

88
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 3>then leads to grave on happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I'm.</v>

89
00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost feeling level right and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming from,</v>

90
00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:50.121
<v Speaker 3>it's almost a platonic idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that the mind of man reflects </v>

91
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:50.121
<v Speaker 3>the mind of God to the extent that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

92
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:54.530
<v Speaker 3>That not only is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is I would argue that that extra </v>

93
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.110
<v Speaker 3>revelation is necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even if you don't use revelation,</v>

94
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.260
<v Speaker 3>that using your capacity to reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can find a purpose in something </v>

95
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.260
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

96
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.150
<v Speaker 3>But we ended up at the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is the set of values that if you </v>

97
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.150
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

98
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you stray away from this common set </v>

99
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 3>of values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm talking like the most root level</v>

100
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal responsibility,</v>

101
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:14.931
<v Speaker 3>free will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your job to be responsible for </v>

102
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:15.420
<v Speaker 3>members of your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your job to make good decisions and</v>

103
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:18.690
<v Speaker 3>responsible decisions and not to blame </v>
<v Speaker 3>the society around you for failures that</v>

104
00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:23.691
<v Speaker 3>you are yourself responsible for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't surpass your own innate </v>

105
00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 3>capacity in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

106
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 3>in terms of you can't expect society to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make up for your lack of innate capacity</v>

107
00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:33.561
<v Speaker 3>in certain areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to make the most of what </v>

108
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:33.561
<v Speaker 3>you have in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You and I agree on values,</v>

109
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 3>but I think that the source of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>

110
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a slight </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreement on I think.</v>

111
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 3>I think it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

112
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a profound place for disagreement </v>

113
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't understand how to mediate it</v>

114
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 2>exactly because I'm not willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispense with the metaphysical.</v>

115
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I did my biblical lectures last </v>

116
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called him a psycho psychological </v>

117
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biblical stories,</v>

118
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.381
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I wanted to push a secular </v>

119
00:05:58.381 --> 00:05:58.381
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of scientific</v>

120
00:05:58.381 --> 00:06:00.630
<v Speaker 4>interpretation by the stories is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>not to interrupt.</v>

121
00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's supremely useful to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people specifically because I mean,</v>

122
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that I come from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious background,</v>

123
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to make arguments that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>not religious in orientation.</v>

124
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 4>I never cite to the Bible when I talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about values,</v>

125
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.640
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never site revelation.</v>

126
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 4>It's valuable to me because I think that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good source of the values and I</v>

127
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 4>think that it's an irrelevant source of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the values,</v>

128
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 4>but it is not the only way to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 4>those values.</v>

129
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I've never suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

130
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:26.381
<v Speaker 4>that atheists can be moral or that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be an agnostic and not believe in </v>

131
00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:30.610
<v Speaker 4>Judeo Christian systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Revelation and comes to the same exact </v>

132
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.761
<v Speaker 4>set of values that we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>now is also a simpler argument to make </v>

133
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 4>because you constrain the number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary.</v>

134
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Very exactly.</v>

135
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.400
<v Speaker 4>But having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not willing to dispense with the </v>

136
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.981
<v Speaker 4>metaphysical and I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an I'm like stretching the </v>

137
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 4>edges of my cognitive ability when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about this sort of thing because</v>

138
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:50.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm in realms that I don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's,</v>

139
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.740
<v Speaker 4>that I just getting vague pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

140
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's as if there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a revelation,</v>

141
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.420
<v Speaker 4>a revelation from evolution that matches</v>
<v Speaker 4>the revelation from above.</v>

142
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:03.590
<v Speaker 4>The two things come together and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't under,</v>

143
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how that can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

144
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 4>I think it has something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental nature of consciousness,</v>

145
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 4>which is something we seriously do not </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

146
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.190
<v Speaker 4>And so I can see you can make a straight</v>
<v Speaker 4>biological case for the evolution of </v>

147
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.571
<v Speaker 4>archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think that the biological </v>

148
00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 4>explanation exhausts the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more to it and it,</v>

149
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.350
<v Speaker 4>and what I've learned to and delving </v>
<v Speaker 4>into these religious stories but also </v>

150
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 4>into religious experience is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottomless.</v>

151
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 4>Like there is a point where as you dig </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the architectural,</v>

152
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 4>everything turns into one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Biological,</v>

153
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 4>spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendent.</v>

154
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 4>It's all one thing from the top to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom.</v>

155
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.490
<v Speaker 4>And I think people get intimations of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that when they have profound </v>

156
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences that are generated by music,</v>

157
00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I love or by sex or there's a variety</v>

158
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:57.131
<v Speaker 4>of ways that they can be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anytime you have an experience of </v>

159
00:07:57.131 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 4>meaning in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can also see that.</v>

160
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 4>And I believe this to be the case is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are,</v>

161
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 4>you're neurologically adapted to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe where meaning is the highest </v>

162
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.650
<v Speaker 4>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean that technically is that when</v>

163
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:14.651
<v Speaker 4>you're sitting in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening around you is </v>

164
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 4>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your nervous system is signaling to</v>

165
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:20.711
<v Speaker 4>you is that you occupy the optimal </v>
<v Speaker 4>position in the dynamic territory that </v>

166
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 4>you currently inhabit.</v>

167
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.680
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that sense of meaning is it's not </v>

168
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:26.680
<v Speaker 4>just cortical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

169
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.780
<v Speaker 4>it's way deeper than merely cortical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a very exciting.</v>

170
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 4>That's a very exciting discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that I think that because </v>

171
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.330
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a place where we agree is that </v>

172
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:39.330
<v Speaker 4>meaning is uncovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not some,</v>

173
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.780
<v Speaker 4>it's discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not something that you're making up</v>

174
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I think it's revealed.</v>

175
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because we're like happiness.</v>

176
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that one of the reasons </v>

177
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.031
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the message that we're putting out </v>

178
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:52.031
<v Speaker 4>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is making people happier.</v>

179
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:56.320
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though we're both pessimist by </v>

180
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.320
<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think a,</v>

181
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.320
<v Speaker 4>is that what</v>

182
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.100
<v Speaker 3>we're basically saying is that in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>land of chaos where you could be </v>

183
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 3>wandering around with no meaning there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a meaning and if you search for it,</v>

184
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.460
<v Speaker 3>you'll find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be open to the concept </v>

185
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:07.460
<v Speaker 3>that there is a meaning to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered.</v>

186
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.540
<v Speaker 3>And if you shut yourself off from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>by just saying there's no meaning to be </v>

187
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.331
<v Speaker 3>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning as to be made up by you and you </v>

188
00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 3>can just do what you want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A phenomenal thing is just,</v>

189
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 3>it's just something that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced,</v>

190
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's not really real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

191
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.260
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

192
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think disquieting to people.</v>

193
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 3>And so there's something that quiets the</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul that says you have purpose.</v>

194
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't have purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe it's because you're searching</v>

195
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 3>in the wrong place for that purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a possibility.</v>

196
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 3>That's really interesting things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you said there because it's like I know </v>

197
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 3>you guys pretty well at this point and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this crew of people that were sort of in</v>

198
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're off camera,</v>

199
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 3>we're actually talking about the exact </v>
<v Speaker 3>same things like we are live.</v>

200
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Whether this camera was on right now are</v>
<v Speaker 3>off like we're living this thing all the</v>

201
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:50.991
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I can speak from my own </v>

202
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.671
<v Speaker 3>experience in this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made me a better person and I will </v>

203
00:09:52.671 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 3>and I'm still striving to be about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>more authentic,</v>

204
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 3>a more honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly.</v>

205
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:59.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean I sit in this chair when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there and look at the person over </v>

206
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:02.841
<v Speaker 3>here every week and I actually here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I listen and I sit across great minds </v>

207
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

208
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:09.501
<v Speaker 3>I have to reevaluate some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think and sometimes it's because </v>

209
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with someone or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

210
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 3>they really don't know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

211
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 3>but often it's hopefully that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing somebody say some great.</v>

212
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.600
<v Speaker 3>This is what's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what's,</v>

213
00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 3>what's great about conversations like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this one is when.</v>

214
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have Jordan on my facebook live and</v>

215
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:27.201
<v Speaker 3>I asked him questions or he'll have me </v>
<v Speaker 3>on his youtube and he's asking </v>

216
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:27.201
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're all really in the business of</v>

217
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:31.611
<v Speaker 3>all of us who are occupying the space is</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking questions or treated as weird </v>

218
00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 3>because we're asking the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

219
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 3>If you're actually listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>

220
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I always think,</v>

221
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:35.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

222
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 3>you might have something to tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my rule number 11.</v>

223
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:43.221
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume that the person you're </v>

224
00:10:43.221 --> 00:10:43.221
<v Speaker 3>listening to might know something you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

225
00:10:43.221 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then you can,</v>

226
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.320
<v Speaker 3>they can tell you about to you and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn it then you don't have to run </v>

227
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 3>face first into a brick wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really helped.</v>

228
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.380
<v Speaker 3>And then it and from Jewish tradition </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's deeply embedded in Jewish </v>

229
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:53.380
<v Speaker 3>tradition that the wise man is the man </v>
<v Speaker 3>who learns from every man around him.</v>

230
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.420
<v Speaker 3>And so this idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

231
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 3>is what unifies this really disparate </v>
<v Speaker 3>stream of people.</v>

232
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 3>The three of us people like Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like Joe Rogan.</v>

233
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean like you look at me and Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what we have in right?</v>

234
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 3>We like asking questions and we will </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually look like you might be </v>

235
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 3>different species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

236
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:10.700
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

237
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I found the same thing when I</v>

238
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 3>was on Jocko willink podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

239
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

240
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:20.270
<v Speaker 3>we're very different people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what's in common is that </v>

241
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.871
<v Speaker 3>we're able to have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're actually able to have a </v>

242
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:23.871
<v Speaker 3>conversation and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we're aiming.</v>

243
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all aiming at making things better</v>

244
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:31.101
<v Speaker 3>rather than worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also a very important thing to </v>

245
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:31.530
<v Speaker 3>massively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that makes that happen</v>

246
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 3>is the fact that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

247
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 3>talking about first principles all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

248
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 3>When people talk at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>iceberg,</v>

249
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:41.930
<v Speaker 3>then it's impossible for them to even </v>
<v Speaker 3>see sometimes that they're actually </v>

250
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.501
<v Speaker 3>standing on two different icebergs </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than they're not seeing the </v>

251
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:45.501
<v Speaker 3>commonalities of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

252
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.870
<v Speaker 3>and they're not seeing what's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I,</v>

253
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 3>if I argue first principles with </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

254
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:54.650
<v Speaker 3>then you can see how those first </v>
<v Speaker 3>principles manifest in political </v>

255
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.650
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The business that I'm in.</v>

256
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're just arguing about a </v>

257
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.571
<v Speaker 4>certain political policy without </v>
<v Speaker 4>examining anything that goes underneath </v>

258
00:12:00.571 --> 00:12:03.421
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you just ended up clubbing each </v>

259
00:12:03.421 --> 00:12:05.311
<v Speaker 4>other and not even understanding what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other person's saying because you </v>

260
00:12:05.311 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 4>don't understand the set of values that </v>
<v Speaker 4>deriving those political principles.</v>

261
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 4>Part of the problem that we have right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now in our culture is trying to diagnose</v>

262
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 4>the level at which the discussion should</v>
<v Speaker 4>be taking place.</v>

263
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.670
<v Speaker 4>And I think the reason that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tumultuous time is because it actually </v>

264
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 4>is a time for discussion of first </v>
<v Speaker 4>principles and it's,</v>

265
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 4>it's that first principles are virtually</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the level of theology.</v>

266
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.920
<v Speaker 4>Because first principles are the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you assume and then move forward.</v>

267
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

268
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 4>what should we assume while the dignity </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the human soul,</v>

269
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.540
<v Speaker 4>but start with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't treat yourself properly </v>

270
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 4>without assuming that you can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with another person.</v>

271
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 4>You can't stabilize your family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have a functional society.</v>

272
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 4>So what does it mean for the human soul </v>
<v Speaker 4>have dignity?</v>

273
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the part of the idea is that you're </v>

274
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 4>participating in creation itself and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that with your actions.</v>

275
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:54.391
<v Speaker 4>And your language and you get to decide </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're tilting the world a bit </v>

276
00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:58.050
<v Speaker 4>more towards heaven or a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards hell and that's actually what </v>

277
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.891
<v Speaker 4>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a place where the literal and </v>

278
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:02.350
<v Speaker 4>metaphorical truth come together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are very,</v>

279
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.100
<v Speaker 4>they're terrified of that idea as they </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be because it's a massive </v>

280
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.611
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a massive realization of </v>

281
00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:15.661
<v Speaker 4>responsibility to understand that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the decisions that you make during the </v>

282
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:19.500
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our decisions between Hell and heaven </v>

283
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think there is no truer way of </v>

284
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 4>saying that.</v>

285
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.700
<v Speaker 1>So as you guys have both sort of hit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>level that you're at.</v>

286
00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:28.701
<v Speaker 1>And I was at the turning point thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you a couple of weeks ago and you </v>

287
00:13:28.701 --> 00:13:29.340
<v Speaker 1>literally came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the rolling stones came out.</v>

288
00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were going bananas.</v>

289
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I talked about all my political </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences with them that we've </v>

290
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.110
<v Speaker 1>discussed about being pro choice and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage.</v>

291
00:13:37.111 --> 00:13:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Although they are basically okay with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and,</v>

292
00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and being pro pot and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got a standing ovation.</v>

293
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.030
<v Speaker 1>We did our thing and in Clemson and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line for you after,</v>

294
00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:46.890
<v Speaker 1>it was longer than the line for me and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>told you this,</v>

295
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:47.550
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

296
00:13:47.551 --> 00:13:50.190
<v Speaker 1>that makes me want to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to.</v>

297
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't jealous of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

298
00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:53.850
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing something great and I have to</v>

299
00:13:53.851 --> 00:13:58.851
<v Speaker 1>be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my question for you is this was all </v>

300
00:13:58.851 --> 00:14:02.241
<v Speaker 1>meant to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean without going too religious or </v>

301
00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:05.241
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Internet has now allowed all of </v>

302
00:14:05.241 --> 00:14:08.781
<v Speaker 1>the people that were watching television</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing pop culture and going </v>

303
00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:11.100
<v Speaker 1>something is really wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something is missing.</v>

304
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.130
<v Speaker 1>The Internet has sort of forced us </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

305
00:14:14.131 --> 00:14:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this growing group is because we're.</v>

306
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not because we're all looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

307
00:14:17.851 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 1>It's because we're being forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

308
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really funny is the way that </v>

309
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.140
<v Speaker 4>everybody is introduced to our work is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the same way,</v>

310
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.850
<v Speaker 4>but it's the way that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>expect.</v>

311
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:31.851
<v Speaker 4>So most people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Jordan originally saw you in a </v>

312
00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:33.090
<v Speaker 4>confrontation with somebody over Trans </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gender Pronouns.</v>

313
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how most people began to </v>

314
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:38.300
<v Speaker 4>engage and then suddenly you are getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>500,000</v>

315
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.540
<v Speaker 4>views on discussions of biblical stories</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Genesis,</v>

316
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.500
<v Speaker 4>which yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

317
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.490
<v Speaker 4>let's be frank if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

318
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.890
<v Speaker 4>if the first thing never happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things at 5,000</v>

319
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.460
<v Speaker 4>views,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

320
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.320
<v Speaker 4>Then the same thing is true for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

321
00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:51.321
<v Speaker 4>The way that I originally kind of drew </v>
<v Speaker 4>public attention was because I was on </v>

322
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 4>piers Morgan's show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shall act him on his show.</v>

323
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 3>And so all of a sudden people were now </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to hour long lectures about,</v>

324
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

325
00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.480
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ideas on philosophy and principles of</v>

326
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 3>the founding fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They came for the scandal and stayed for</v>

327
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 3>the content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

328
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:08.171
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the advantage that it takes a </v>

329
00:15:08.171 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 3>particular skill set for everyone in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this space to be able to do that.</v>

330
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the beauty of the,</v>

331
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:15.911
<v Speaker 3>of the youtube moment and over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet moment is that people are </v>

332
00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:19.001
<v Speaker 3>engaging in the news level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just watch any cable news </v>

333
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:19.001
<v Speaker 3>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new cycle is about 30 seconds long.</v>

334
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Then the repeat the headlines again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

335
00:15:20.201 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the level at which we </v>
<v Speaker 3>consume,</v>

336
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:27.130
<v Speaker 3>but if you see every sees the flash </v>
<v Speaker 3>point for you or the flash point for me </v>

337
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.581
<v Speaker 3>or the flashpoint for Sam with Ben </v>
<v Speaker 3>Affleck and one of the flash point for </v>

338
00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:30.581
<v Speaker 3>you with number many of them for you.</v>

339
00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:34.170
<v Speaker 3>And then they and then they want more </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the introduction of the,</v>

340
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:39.190
<v Speaker 3>it's basically the gateway drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a 32nd video that's the </v>

341
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.651
<v Speaker 3>gateway drug to these hour long lectures</v>
<v Speaker 3>about deeper principles and people and </v>

342
00:15:41.651 --> 00:15:46.181
<v Speaker 3>the reason that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the question is why those </v>

343
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:46.780
<v Speaker 3>flashpoints flash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the because what makes those</v>

344
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:51.781
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes it that people want to see </v>

345
00:15:51.781 --> 00:15:51.781
<v Speaker 3>that and then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

346
00:15:51.781 --> 00:15:54.311
<v Speaker 3>now I want to see the rest of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>content and start streaming tons of </v>

347
00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:55.720
<v Speaker 3>videos from these folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kathy Newman video is a good example.</v>

348
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.390
<v Speaker 3>So let's get to that in one second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

349
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I just want to lead that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just that I think it's incongruent.</v>

350
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:06.790
<v Speaker 3>They see something different and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>notice a difference in the society on </v>

351
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.840
<v Speaker 3>any level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you are automatically a pariah and </v>

352
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.361
<v Speaker 3>an outlier and we all know deep down </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are distinctions and </v>

353
00:16:13.361 --> 00:16:13.670
<v Speaker 3>differences to be made logically </v>
<v Speaker 3>between.</v>

354
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even talking about groups of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people ethnically,</v>

355
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some odd reason.</v>

356
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:22.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about just logical </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinctions between modes of thought </v>

357
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.200
<v Speaker 3>and logical distinctions between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

358
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.720
<v Speaker 3>between certain policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>

359
00:16:24.721 --> 00:16:29.721
<v Speaker 3>if you are willing to draw distinctions </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of just saying that we have to </v>

360
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:29.721
<v Speaker 3>exist in this morass of identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

361
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.840
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a flash in the darkness and people </v>

362
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:34.840
<v Speaker 3>gravitate toward the light</v>

363
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 2>partly because the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with rel relativism,</v>

364
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.780
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that that did produce a </v>

365
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:43.780
<v Speaker 2>radical state of equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

366
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.461
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and the problem with there being no </v>

367
00:16:48.461 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no hope.</v>

368
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with that is that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually live on hope.</v>

369
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you flatten out the value </v>

370
00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.291
<v Speaker 2>structure so that there is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualitative differentiation between </v>

371
00:16:59.291 --> 00:16:59.291
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's nothing to do.</v>

372
00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 2>So that's just not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you can tell people,</v>

373
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:03.680
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make no mistake about it,</v>

374
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.510
<v Speaker 2>there is down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hell,</v>

375
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.480
<v Speaker 2>that's Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the gulags like that's down,</v>

376
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.790
<v Speaker 2>that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exists in your own family.</v>

377
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 2>You can create that with no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because there's a down like that,</v>

378
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Speaker 2>there's also an APP and that APP is </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth aiming at.</v>

379
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Even though it differentiates people as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they climb towards it.</v>

380
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without that,</v>

381
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.320
<v Speaker 2>you can't have the purpose in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gives it meaning and nobility in </v>

382
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.480
<v Speaker 2>the face of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a no,</v>

383
00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.480
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of think it's almost like we're all</v>

384
00:17:30.481 --> 00:17:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Frankenstein's monster in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the.</v>

385
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.780
<v Speaker 1>If the mainstream media had been dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly with the issues of the day,</v>

386
00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:41.781
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics are postmodernism or </v>

387
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:43.620
<v Speaker 1>just the general political discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I don't think people would react to</v>

388
00:17:43.621 --> 00:17:46.140
<v Speaker 1>you guys the way that they do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't do their job.</v>

389
00:17:46.141 --> 00:17:47.850
<v Speaker 1>But really quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you hit these.</v>

390
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>So your more I think were three moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you already hit them.</v>

391
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 1>But just for people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't falling,</v>

392
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:57.561
<v Speaker 1>all this you on piers Morgan basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>bashing him endlessly with facts over </v>

393
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:03.561
<v Speaker 1>feelings about guns was one where it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this guy from the Internet just </v>

394
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:07.620
<v Speaker 1>beat this CNN per person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did that happen?</v>

395
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I think the one that changed me</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than anything else,</v>

396
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows this already with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris on real time with,</v>

397
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 1>with athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got into this stuff about,</v>

398
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 1>about the difference between Muslims and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

399
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know who sam was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this mild mannered neuroscientists</v>

400
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:23.100
<v Speaker 1>in a nice suit commonly talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pew statistics.</v>

401
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gross and racist.</v>

402
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.870
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a good segue to yours </v>

403
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.611
<v Speaker 1>because I think yours is the third one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way that this is just two or </v>

404
00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:31.611
<v Speaker 1>three weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

405
00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you were on with Kathy Newman on it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada channel for UK,</v>

406
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.210
<v Speaker 1>UK channel for sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is,</v>

407
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone that's watching this has </v>

408
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 1>probably seen this already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't,</v>

409
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.610
<v Speaker 1>you should go watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

410
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.640
<v Speaker 1>but in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically she tried to make an argument </v>

411
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.430
<v Speaker 1>that you have heard a good Julian Times </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

412
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:55.431
<v Speaker 1>but why does your right to free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>supersede a trans person's right to feel</v>

413
00:18:56.461 --> 00:19:01.461
<v Speaker 1>okay with themselves or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the way she phrased the question </v>

414
00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:02.260
<v Speaker 1>was a little confused and conflated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

415
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 1>But the reaction to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was your,</v>

416
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.980
<v Speaker 1>your answer was great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the reaction to regular </v>

417
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:09.980
<v Speaker 1>people watching at home that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

418
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 1>this is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just abject.</v>

419
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:17.610
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only thing that's to make it viral </v>

420
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.200
<v Speaker 5>is the fact that she recognized in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment to what she was saying moment </v>

421
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.740
<v Speaker 5>where you could see the light go on </v>
<v Speaker 5>briefly and she just went,</v>

422
00:19:20.741 --> 00:19:21.850
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did I just say?</v>

423
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.830
<v Speaker 5>And there was no escape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty.</v>

424
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:24.890
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty grand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

425
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:29.910
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the funny thing about her argument is </v>

426
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.651
<v Speaker 5>that it's Pr was predicated on the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>that somehow people have a right to be </v>

427
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:35.881
<v Speaker 5>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that's just not a right you </v>

428
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:38.200
<v Speaker 5>have in life all the things you can say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you don't have a right to in life.</v>

429
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.370
<v Speaker 5>Being comfortable is number one is you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can offend me right now,</v>

430
00:19:42.371 --> 00:19:45.850
<v Speaker 5>so the thing is is if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're right to be comfortable,</v>

431
00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:50.851
<v Speaker 5>trumps my right to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then I don't get to talk ever because </v>

432
00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:52.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm actually talking,</v>

433
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're,</v>

434
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.620
<v Speaker 5>if they're profound things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they're contentious,</v>

435
00:19:56.621 --> 00:20:01.621
<v Speaker 5>things are truthful things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say things that if they </v>

436
00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:02.440
<v Speaker 5>don't disturb you are going to disturb </v>
<v Speaker 5>you and if they don't disturb you,</v>

437
00:20:02.441 --> 00:20:04.270
<v Speaker 5>there's someone that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>disturbed about them.</v>

438
00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:09.271
<v Speaker 5>So what's the answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone can be comfortable in the </v>

439
00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:12.901
<v Speaker 5>silence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't also doesn't work </v>

440
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:13.330
<v Speaker 5>because then we can't exchange ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not comfortable in the silence.</v>

441
00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:15.670
<v Speaker 5>We're isolated and Dan didn't the </v>
<v Speaker 5>silence,</v>

442
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.220
<v Speaker 5>so it's a completely incoherent </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>

443
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.120
<v Speaker 1>but what does that tell you about just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way mainstream media operates?</v>

444
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Because if you even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just in this last week when I've </v>

445
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.731
<v Speaker 1>read some of the pieces about you that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think are so dishonesty attacking the </v>

446
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:33.571
<v Speaker 1>way you do things or even there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>article about you and it was like Ben </v>

447
00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro is the cool kids philosopher or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

448
00:20:35.531 --> 00:20:36.940
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:38.860
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well wait a minute.</v>

450
00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:42.190
<v Speaker 1>When did the cool kid be the smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Jew?</v>

451
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:42.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

452
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:42.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

453
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:43.960
<v Speaker 5>how did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how does that.</v>

454
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 5>But think about that.</v>

455
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And then you've talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've talked about the shit that you </v>

456
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:53.100
<v Speaker 1>went through when you were growing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff and you don't want to</v>

457
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.691
<v Speaker 1>play the regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't imagine exactly the same.</v>

458
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Just like small and noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad combat,</v>

459
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.590
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have taken care of both of you.</v>

460
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I always say I was right on the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sort of like loser and cool.</v>

461
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.820
<v Speaker 1>So like I actually did believe the kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>below me,</v>

462
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 1>but I was bullied by the guys that were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was right there.</v>

463
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that maybe that keeps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in balance.</v>

464
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:19.380
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this idea that when they write the </v>

465
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.011
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the cool kids will ask her even </v>

466
00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:25.081
<v Speaker 1>though obviously you didn't grow up as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cool kid or James Demore is a great </v>

467
00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:25.880
<v Speaker 1>one where they write articles about him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll say the,</v>

468
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.800
<v Speaker 1>the tech Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like if you both have met James</v>

469
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the shyest.</v>

470
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Quietest decent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You almost literally have to drag </v>

471
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:36.360
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.610
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>

473
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.250
<v Speaker 1>But a spine of steel though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really something.</v>

474
00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fearless.</v>

475
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Despite what his disposition may </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be.</v>

476
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what do you make of that?</v>

477
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 1>The way that they try to frame it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're already trying to undercut,</v>

478
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean before it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you even say it</v>

479
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.590
<v Speaker 4>is your model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that they're trying to </v>

480
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.590
<v Speaker 4>impose their own order on the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the wrong frame.</v>

481
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 4>So that's what happened in the channel </v>
<v Speaker 4>for interview and it's,</v>

482
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.760
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about the model that you </v>

483
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.801
<v Speaker 4>were describing with regards to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>position on the iceberg is that Kathy </v>

484
00:22:07.801 --> 00:22:11.461
<v Speaker 4>had staked out a position on the iceberg</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I had staked one out that was way </v>

485
00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:14.320
<v Speaker 4>lower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way lower and what happened was she kept</v>

486
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:19.321
<v Speaker 4>questioning me at her level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that just wasn't working because </v>

487
00:22:19.321 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't the level of analysis at </v>
<v Speaker 4>which I'm playing.</v>

488
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm also not playing,</v>

489
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 4>although I'm trying to play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>

490
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.500
<v Speaker 4>because it's a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

491
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:32.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was like wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a lower base of gravity and,</v>

492
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.790
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that gave you an </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage and that's partly.</v>

493
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.020
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't trying to win the interview.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

494
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:42.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I and I don't try to win </v>

495
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.060
<v Speaker 4>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd try to go to an interview and have a</v>

496
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 4>talk and have a discussion and see how </v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes.</v>

497
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:47.480
<v Speaker 4>And I don't have an agenda except to not</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a catastrophic mistake,</v>

498
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.960
<v Speaker 4>but that's agenda number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't say anything.</v>

499
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Unforgivably stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

500
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.530
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the other thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes all of this unique is that if</v>

501
00:22:56.531 --> 00:23:01.531
<v Speaker 4>you actually meet any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we've all met each other in the </v>

502
00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:01.531
<v Speaker 4>circle now because it's really funny how</v>
<v Speaker 4>life works that way.</v>

503
00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:06.010
<v Speaker 4>These circles are so small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we tell each other and we actually </v>

504
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.010
<v Speaker 4>talk with each other and all this.</v>

505
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're forcing us together.</v>

506
00:23:06.021 --> 00:23:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not even that we're seeking it,</v>

507
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.890
<v Speaker 4>but it's also that we all have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain.</v>

508
00:23:09.891 --> 00:23:14.891
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain baseline personality </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we all have and that is we enjoy </v>

509
00:23:14.891 --> 00:23:19.271
<v Speaker 4>the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We actually enjoyed the exchange of </v>

510
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:21.480
<v Speaker 4>ideas and so when you're on with Kathy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Newman and she says stuff that like </v>

511
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:21.480
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

512
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.690
<v Speaker 4>what you were getting from the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the lot was how to even stand this.</v>

513
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.010
<v Speaker 4>How do you understand this interview?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

514
00:23:25.011 --> 00:23:28.910
<v Speaker 4>How can you get through half an hour of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and you've done it and I've done it</v>

515
00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:33.911
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is because I sort of </v>

516
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:33.911
<v Speaker 4>enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is what you do for a living.</v>

517
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:38.291
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that I don't enjoy having </v>

518
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:38.291
<v Speaker 4>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even with people who don't get it,</v>

519
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:43.001
<v Speaker 4>it's not enjoyable having your views </v>
<v Speaker 4>radically mischaracterized as he as </v>

520
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Kathy Newman was trying to do to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's irritating,</v>

521
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.340
<v Speaker 4>but I was so over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was hardly even irritated.</v>

522
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly kept thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

523
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who you're talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't me.</v>

524
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

525
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so because of,</v>

526
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:59.710
<v Speaker 3>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the most infuriating thing to </v>

527
00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.290
<v Speaker 3>people on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the hardcore left and in the media,</v>

528
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.030
<v Speaker 3>because if they can't fit you into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>frame,</v>

529
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:07.031
<v Speaker 3>it's what you were saying before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show started and if they can't fit you </v>

530
00:24:07.031 --> 00:24:08.640
<v Speaker 3>into this preconceived notion of Russian</v>
<v Speaker 3>nesting doll that they've got for you.</v>

531
00:24:08.641 --> 00:24:10.220
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't fit in there,</v>

532
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.370
<v Speaker 3>then they can't do anything with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're an open minded person who </v>

533
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.160
<v Speaker 3>actually likes to hear exchange of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're willing to admit that there's</v>

534
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 3>a piece of evidence you may not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered yet,</v>

535
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 3>it's almost impossible to be caught off </v>
<v Speaker 3>guard.</v>

536
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.730
<v Speaker 3>But these people refuse to acknowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's evidence they haven't </v>

537
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:27.730
<v Speaker 3>considered yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do they just throw away the evidence?</v>

538
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Like if I brought you a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence that country that can do roll </v>

539
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:32.410
<v Speaker 3>deed say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

540
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 3>that either fits in my worldview or it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't if it doesn't,</v>

541
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:37.631
<v Speaker 3>but it's a real piece of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's how I have to kind of shape and </v>

542
00:24:37.631 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 3>changed my world view in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accommodate that piece of evidence.</v>

543
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what smart and decent</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>

544
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.240
<v Speaker 3>But at the media is not in that role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where Joe show was </v>

545
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:46.240
<v Speaker 3>successful is because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

546
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 3>he's not a classical intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks about ideas a lot.</v>

547
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:51.170
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about joe is he's actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>curious.</v>

548
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.210
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he asks a question and he'd like to</v>

549
00:24:53.211 --> 00:24:54.700
<v Speaker 3>know the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

550
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 3>and it's not so that he can demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's right.</v>

551
00:24:57.081 --> 00:24:58.040
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this viewpoint,</v>

552
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 3>so obviously like everyone does because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a viewpoint,</v>

553
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.740
<v Speaker 3>but he does ask the questions he'd like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to know the answers to and that's that </v>

554
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.270
<v Speaker 3>and youtube seems to reward that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so hooray for them when it's also the </v>

555
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.890
<v Speaker 3>fact that it's a longer forum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a longer span forum is also a nontrivial</v>

556
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.810
<v Speaker 3>advantage because people can take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time to riddick into something.</v>

557
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.870
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think a lot about what makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these various people have such </v>

558
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.111
<v Speaker 3>different stripes successful and what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized is that so much of it is just </v>

559
00:25:26.111 --> 00:25:30.551
<v Speaker 3>like in any movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the reason you watch a movie is </v>

560
00:25:30.551 --> 00:25:30.551
<v Speaker 3>because you know where the movie's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to end.</v>

561
00:25:30.551 --> 00:25:33.911
<v Speaker 3>It's going to end with the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go turning off the screen and then </v>

562
00:25:33.911 --> 00:25:33.911
<v Speaker 3>you're going to leave the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

563
00:25:33.911 --> 00:25:35.120
<v Speaker 3>The every movie ends the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's you're there for the journey.</v>

564
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.530
<v Speaker 3>And so when you watch your show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

565
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.620
<v Speaker 3>and you're actually trying to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and take people along your </v>

566
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:45.221
<v Speaker 3>thought journey and when you watch your </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures on the Bible and you're </v>

567
00:25:45.221 --> 00:25:48.371
<v Speaker 3>tracking them along a journey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a journey of exploration and certainly </v>

568
00:25:48.371 --> 00:25:48.980
<v Speaker 3>with Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe or Joe is taking you for three hours</v>

569
00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 3>through his thought process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking questions and going somewhere and</v>

570
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 3>even when I'm doing my political show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my idea is here I'm going to lay out all</v>

571
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:59.621
<v Speaker 3>the evidence and then try and piece it </v>
<v Speaker 3>together so that we get to a conclusion </v>

572
00:25:59.621 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 3>together and you can disagree with any </v>
<v Speaker 3>step I take along that way,</v>

573
00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:03.200
<v Speaker 3>but here's the journey that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>go on so you can follow along with me.</v>

574
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.470
<v Speaker 3>I think what the media do is they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>go straight from the beginning of the </v>

575
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.470
<v Speaker 3>movie to the end of the movie with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>journey and they just go,</v>

576
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.410
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the Intro,</v>

577
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luke Skywalker is on a planet by himself</v>

578
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:16.991
<v Speaker 3>and then you just go straight to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Millennium Falcon flying where you're </v>

579
00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:16.991
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

580
00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Just what happened in the middle there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that why we're we're we then,</v>

581
00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.620
<v Speaker 3>or let's say your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your moment with Kathy,</v>

582
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 3>that we're sort of the glitch in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system now.</v>

583
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Like to me that were the undecidable in </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodern terms there.</v>

584
00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:29.210
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

585
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:29.920
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

586
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.000
<v Speaker 3>that's a glitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we were watching the matrix,</v>

587
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 3>that's the glitch that you got to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the wasn't on Youtube.</v>

588
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.680
<v Speaker 3>This was on real television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that that even matters more than </v>

589
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:41.680
<v Speaker 3>this because I think this is the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing now.</v>

590
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 3>But you caused the glitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

591
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 2>what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You caused the glitch and her.</v>

592
00:26:45.721 --> 00:26:47.450
<v Speaker 2>She actually couldn't come up with words</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

593
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 2>but you actually was actually a glitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the system that then.</v>

594
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was aided.</v>

595
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Everything else that you're doing isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>imposed narrative and I mean,</v>

596
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 2>part of that's a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathology of the medium,</v>

597
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I would say is that one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really like I stopped watching </v>

598
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.781
<v Speaker 2>televised news like 25 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that made me stop </v>

599
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 2>was my realization that the newscasters </v>
<v Speaker 2>would show a politician.</v>

600
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'd give him like his 10 </v>

601
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:16.140
<v Speaker 2>seconds or heard her 10 seconds to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

602
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Then they'd fade out the audio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the newscaster would tell you what </v>

603
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.150
<v Speaker 2>the person said and what it meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

604
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:22.230
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not so good.</v>

605
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's there's something gone,</v>

606
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 2>gone horribly wrong there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's.</v>

607
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 2>It's become more and more like that over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 30 years.</v>

608
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Partly I think that's because journalism</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

609
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:37.220
<v Speaker 2>classic journalism is degenerating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's becoming a more and more desperate </v>

610
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 2>game for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for smaller and smaller stakes.</v>

611
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 2>But Youtube offers something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

612
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 2>that the traditional broadcasters just </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't offer.</v>

613
00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 2>And that's weirdly enough for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that started out with cute cat videos.</v>

614
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:52.941
<v Speaker 2>It's actual depth and the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like a three hour conversation </v>

615
00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 2>turns out people actually like that.</v>

616
00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.160
<v Speaker 1>But that's why I think that youtube are </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly interesting cases because I</v>

617
00:27:57.161 --> 00:27:59.680
<v Speaker 1>view you as sort of like a pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>political beast.</v>

618
00:27:59.681 --> 00:28:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And yet you've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of all of this,</v>

619
00:28:01.571 --> 00:28:06.571
<v Speaker 1>you now talk about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think more than probably you </v>

620
00:28:06.571 --> 00:28:07.120
<v Speaker 1>inherently want to perhaps or all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these other things.</v>

621
00:28:07.121 --> 00:28:12.121
<v Speaker 1>And you as a clinical psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's where you really started and </v>

622
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:13.330
<v Speaker 1>now you end up talking about politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

623
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:18.510
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why we all sort of got forced </v>

624
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:18.510
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this space.</v>

625
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 3>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we ended up in the same framework to the</v>

626
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 3>ancient Greeks ended up in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

627
00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:26.421
<v Speaker 3>They would all write a book on ethics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd write one on politics and </v>

628
00:28:26.421 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 3>then he would write one on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the pilot and it all comes together.</v>

629
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean if there is no such thing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>apolitical,</v>

630
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.730
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing as a ethical </v>

631
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:34.730
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're,</v>

632
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.091
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are operating in the sphere of </v>

633
00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:38.091
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are going to end up.</v>

634
00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 3>If you dig deep enough in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>waters that Jordan is used to being.</v>

635
00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:42.130
<v Speaker 3>And if Jordan elevates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

636
00:28:42.131 --> 00:28:47.131
<v Speaker 3>up on that chain far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to end up in these sphere </v>

637
00:28:47.131 --> 00:28:49.491
<v Speaker 3>where I'm used to operating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is why there are videos of you </v>

638
00:28:49.491 --> 00:28:50.210
<v Speaker 3>talking to transgender people about </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Pronoun use a.</v>

639
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.200
<v Speaker 3>What happened</v>

640
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.720
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think was that like I was operating at</v>

641
00:28:53.721 --> 00:28:57.370
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it a psychological level or a</v>

642
00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.440
<v Speaker 2>level of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

643
00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:03.630
<v Speaker 2>of archetypal story essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the political intervened in </v>

644
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:06.740
<v Speaker 2>that and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to interfere with your freedom</v>

645
00:29:06.741 --> 00:29:07.940
<v Speaker 2>of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

646
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.550
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not happening.</v>

647
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.350
<v Speaker 2>I know where that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

648
00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:17.351
<v Speaker 2>and then of course one of the scandals </v>
<v Speaker 2>that emerged out of that this year was </v>

649
00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:18.890
<v Speaker 2>the scandal of Lindsay Shepherd at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wilfrid laurier university,</v>

650
00:29:18.891 --> 00:29:21.530
<v Speaker 2>which was the biggest scandal that ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit a Canadian university,</v>

651
00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:22.790
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I,</v>

652
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:28.510
<v Speaker 2>in my most pessimistic prognostications </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the consequences of bill </v>

653
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:32.600
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't envision the inquisition of </v>

654
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay Shepherd and so thank you very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

655
00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Postmodernists for making that manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So clearly is in the room.</v>

656
00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:39.230
<v Speaker 2>So if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell that story?</v>

657
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a teaching.</v>

658
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:42.790
<v Speaker 2>They a great episode on the Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Report.</v>

659
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:43.450
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

660
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Well she's quite the creature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a.</v>

661
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:50.570
<v Speaker 2>They picked what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They messed with the wrong girl when </v>

662
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.501
<v Speaker 2>they went after her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was in the communications </v>

663
00:29:52.501 --> 00:29:52.501
<v Speaker 2>department at Wilfrid laurier university</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Canada,</v>

664
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:57.630
<v Speaker 2>and she had the temerity to show a five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute clip of me debating the </v>

665
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 2>biological reality of gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say with a professor,</v>

666
00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Nicolas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

667
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:06.871
<v Speaker 2>who famously claimed that there were no </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological differences between men and </v>

668
00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 2>women and that was the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>consensus for the last four decades.</v>

669
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.500
<v Speaker 2>She showed a five minute clip to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>class while and hypothetically someone </v>

670
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.181
<v Speaker 2>complained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it turned out that no one </v>

671
00:30:18.181 --> 00:30:19.981
<v Speaker 2>really did and that was brought to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention of her professors and to an </v>

672
00:30:19.981 --> 00:30:21.700
<v Speaker 2>administrator named Andrea Joel who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically hired as a,</v>

673
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a as an inquisition I would say by the </v>

674
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 2>university under legislative pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they raked her over the coals for an</v>

675
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:33.490
<v Speaker 2>hour and she taped it and she made it </v>
<v Speaker 2>public and it's,</v>

676
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:33.760
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

677
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.630
<v Speaker 2>it was a tape in which they compared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said that playing a,</v>

678
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.020
<v Speaker 2>a video of me debating pronouns was </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrally because she said she did it </v>

679
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 2>neutrally and there's no reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disbelieve her.</v>

680
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Was tantamount to playing a video by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler neutrally or Milo Yiannopoulos </v>

681
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:56.630
<v Speaker 2>has been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The radical leftists are so clueless </v>

682
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 2>that they can't even get their insults </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

683
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not Milo Yiannopoulos or Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

684
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.750
<v Speaker 2>It's one or the other and I've been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this building.</v>

685
00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:04.860
<v Speaker 2>This building has some people at it.</v>

686
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even right now we know that </v>

687
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.000
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to write about this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>write that this was the gathering of the</v>

688
00:31:11.001 --> 00:31:13.520
<v Speaker 1>alt right and all that other nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a weird way,</v>

689
00:31:13.521 --> 00:31:18.521
<v Speaker 1>do we owe the potter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Postmodern is some thanks then because </v>

690
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:18.521
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took,</v>

691
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 1>they forced someone like Lindsay to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>public now and I and I think she's </v>

692
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.891
<v Speaker 1>wonderful as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the tremendous intellect and Bret </v>

693
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

694
00:31:27.321 --> 00:31:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Like all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these people,</v>

695
00:31:28.641 --> 00:31:29.540
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

696
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:34.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone out of the James Damore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he only is someone now with </v>

697
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:36.920
<v Speaker 1>influence because they forced him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address these issues.</v>

698
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.730
<v Speaker 1>So in an odd way we owed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

699
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.510
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the complaining that we might do</v>

700
00:31:41.511 --> 00:31:46.511
<v Speaker 1>about these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we owe them because they've sharpened </v>

701
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:49.150
<v Speaker 1>not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've not only sharpened us </v>

702
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.621
<v Speaker 1>intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they've allowed all these </v>

703
00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:50.621
<v Speaker 1>other people to wake up.</v>

704
00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Monitors had a point like the point is </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the world is susceptible to a </v>

705
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.790
<v Speaker 2>near infinite number of interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens to be true.</v>

706
00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.040
<v Speaker 2>That's why developing artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

707
00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:03.860
<v Speaker 2>especially perceptual systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has turned out to be so difficult.</v>

708
00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.890
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to perceive the world </v>

709
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.171
<v Speaker 2>because you can categorize it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally in a near infinite number of </v>

710
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:11.330
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

711
00:32:11.331 --> 00:32:12.890
<v Speaker 2>and then the next plane was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

712
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.790
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to rank order those </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways in terms of quality.</v>

713
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:17.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

714
00:32:17.541 --> 00:32:20.240
<v Speaker 2>that is very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they pushed it too far.</v>

715
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no qualitative distinctions </v>

716
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:26.800
<v Speaker 2>between loads of interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interpretation all the way down.</v>

717
00:32:26.801 --> 00:32:27.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

718
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:28.420
<v Speaker 6>no</v>

719
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:30.630
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good point.</v>

720
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Hard to disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally wrong.</v>

721
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a finite set of viable </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations.</v>

722
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the layman's term for that would be that</v>

723
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 5>some things are real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

724
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean is that the simplest way to say </v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

725
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 5>There are some things that actually are </v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

726
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 5>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

727
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.600
<v Speaker 5>that's one objection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another objection is there are some </v>

728
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.840
<v Speaker 5>modes of being that lead you to </v>
<v Speaker 5>perdition very,</v>

729
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:58.870
<v Speaker 5>very rapidly and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that isn't somewhere being human </v>

730
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:03.070
<v Speaker 5>that you actually want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's the material reality that's </v>

731
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 5>outside the interpretive framework,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

732
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:08.770
<v Speaker 5>but then there's an ethical reality that</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't material and the same simple </v>

733
00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:12.731
<v Speaker 5>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's an ethical reality that's </v>

734
00:33:12.731 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 5>also not merely a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 5>interpretation.</v>

735
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best example of that I know is Jaak </v>

736
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 5>Panksepp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jaak Panksepp work with rats.</v>

737
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's lots of models of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the animal kingdom,</v>

738
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:24.620
<v Speaker 5>but that this one is particularly good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So juvenile rats like to wrestle.</v>

739
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.640
<v Speaker 5>So if you pair two wraps together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two males,</v>

740
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:33.670
<v Speaker 5>because they particularly liked to </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestle and one of them's 10 percent </v>

741
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.041
<v Speaker 5>bigger than the other one with the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent weight advantage can pin the </v>

742
00:33:36.041 --> 00:33:36.041
<v Speaker 5>little one can consistently.</v>

743
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.300
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you say you pair them once,</v>

744
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.160
<v Speaker 5>they'll work to do this because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>enjoy it.</v>

745
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 5>The big one pins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wins.</v>

746
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.540
<v Speaker 5>Now he's the dominant rap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think?</v>

747
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's dominance among rats.</v>

748
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>except that isn't how it works because </v>

749
00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.810
<v Speaker 5>rats in the wild live in social groups </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they'll play with each other,</v>

750
00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:58.811
<v Speaker 5>continually cross many games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then let's say you pair the two </v>

751
00:33:58.811 --> 00:33:58.910
<v Speaker 5>routes together constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

752
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.920
<v Speaker 5>After the first bout the little rat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the loser has to invite the big route to</v>

753
00:34:03.921 --> 00:34:04.940
<v Speaker 5>play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the rule.</v>

754
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 5>So he does his little play and the big </v>
<v Speaker 5>rep thinks,</v>

755
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.420
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

756
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll play.</v>

757
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.680
<v Speaker 5>If you pair them repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless the big rat lets the little rat </v>

758
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.640
<v Speaker 5>win 30 percent of the time the little </v>
<v Speaker 5>rat will start playing with them.</v>

759
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.680
<v Speaker 5>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just blew me away.</v>

760
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:19.430
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

761
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:24.431
<v Speaker 5>look at that in rats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which have been used as a model for </v>

762
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 5>human behavior for psychologists for </v>
<v Speaker 5>like 100 years in rats.</v>

763
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:33.080
<v Speaker 5>There's an emergent ethic of fairplay </v>
<v Speaker 5>that emerges across iterated games.</v>

764
00:34:33.081 --> 00:34:34.220
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

765
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.760
<v Speaker 5>It's mindboggling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we could use that.</v>

766
00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:41.761
<v Speaker 5>That would be an example of like when </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm playing basketball with my eight </v>

767
00:34:41.761 --> 00:34:44.561
<v Speaker 5>year old nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I occasionally let him live because I </v>

768
00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 5>want to because he needs that reward </v>
<v Speaker 5>going if I just beat him mercilessly and</v>

769
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:47.240
<v Speaker 5>if you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you let him.</v>

770
00:34:47.241 --> 00:34:49.550
<v Speaker 5>When when he does something particularly</v>
<v Speaker 5>spectacular,</v>

771
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.270
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You push them.</v>

772
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.480
<v Speaker 5>There's this thing called the zone of </v>
<v Speaker 5>proximal development and it turns out </v>

773
00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.190
<v Speaker 5>that adults speak to children naturally </v>
<v Speaker 5>at a level.</v>

774
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 5>It's slightly above their level of </v>
<v Speaker 5>comprehension,</v>

775
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.680
<v Speaker 5>so that's the meaning zone essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you keep the kid there because </v>

776
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.341
<v Speaker 5>the kid can talk but also learn at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same time and if you're really playing </v>

777
00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:12.911
<v Speaker 5>well with your eight year old nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna let him win when he's </v>

778
00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:14.360
<v Speaker 5>pushing himself a little harder than you</v>
<v Speaker 5>normally would and you think,</v>

779
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:18.320
<v Speaker 5>well that's he is winning when he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that and so you want to set up the</v>

780
00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 5>game to reward it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's an ethic that transcends mere</v>

781
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 5>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

782
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.850
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't only apply to human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It applies.</v>

783
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.670
<v Speaker 5>And Frans de Waal who studied </v>
<v Speaker 5>chimpanzee's,</v>

784
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:33.671
<v Speaker 5>he's found quite clearly that it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>the most tyrannical chimp who stays on </v>

785
00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:37.770
<v Speaker 5>top because the chimp tyrant who has no </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends who does know mutual grooming,</v>

786
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 5>who's not</v>

787
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:43.190
<v Speaker 4>reciprocal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like he has an off day and two of </v>

788
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.101
<v Speaker 4>his enemies tear him to pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the tyrant champ sits atop a very </v>

789
00:35:46.101 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 4>unstable hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I've thought to,</v>

790
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.660
<v Speaker 4>in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have dominance hierarchies,</v>

791
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.250
<v Speaker 4>we have competence hierarchies and those</v>
<v Speaker 4>are completely different and you have to</v>

792
00:35:56.251 --> 00:36:01.251
<v Speaker 4>be a good player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have iterated games to maintain your </v>

793
00:36:01.251 --> 00:36:04.911
<v Speaker 4>position in a competence hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the beginnings of a </v>

794
00:36:04.911 --> 00:36:05.670
<v Speaker 4>discussion about something like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental ethic.</v>

795
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.910
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can segue this too,</v>

796
00:36:07.911 --> 00:36:11.750
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of the way that some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media deals with you is that you,</v>

797
00:36:11.751 --> 00:36:14.660
<v Speaker 1>because you are fact based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk fast,</v>

798
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you genuinely don't care about </v>

799
00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.331
<v Speaker 1>people's feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you pretty well now you don't </v>

800
00:36:22.331 --> 00:36:23.420
<v Speaker 1>that they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your wife,</v>

801
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:28.450
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know how to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that then because they're used to </v>

802
00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.590
<v Speaker 1>dealing in a realm that is all about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

803
00:36:30.591 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 1>So now you come out and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

804
00:36:32.251 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

805
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:33.770
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way it is.</v>

806
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll debate you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not gonna beat me just </v>

807
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.940
<v Speaker 1>because you happen to be gay or a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever else it is,</v>

808
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.530
<v Speaker 1>and I think actually now that's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason of your your surge.</v>

809
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I think that most people at root level </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't actually want to think of </v>

810
00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.760
<v Speaker 4>themselves as their group identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

811
00:36:51.761 --> 00:36:56.761
<v Speaker 4>I think most people would want to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>respected on an individual level and so </v>

812
00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:57.250
<v Speaker 4>when I say in order for you to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>respected on an individual level,</v>

813
00:36:57.251 --> 00:36:59.440
<v Speaker 4>that means that I'm not going to respect</v>
<v Speaker 4>you on the group level.</v>

814
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Meaning I'm not your group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Identity doesn't mean anything to me.</v>

815
00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Your individual identity means </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything to me,</v>

816
00:37:04.421 --> 00:37:06.040
<v Speaker 4>but your group identity means nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

817
00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.310
<v Speaker 4>And when I say individual identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean how you identify,</v>

818
00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of race or gender.</v>

819
00:37:11.171 --> 00:37:12.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of your thoughts,</v>

820
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.620
<v Speaker 4>are your thoughts interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they right,</v>

821
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.680
<v Speaker 4>are they wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're either right or they're </v>

822
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:19.680
<v Speaker 4>wrong and they're interesting or they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

823
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.770
<v Speaker 4>and that doesn't change based on who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying it and if we could all get there,</v>

824
00:37:20.771 --> 00:37:23.050
<v Speaker 4>I think that that's what people find </v>
<v Speaker 4>appealing is that if you can get there,</v>

825
00:37:23.051 --> 00:37:25.000
<v Speaker 4>then you can actually have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>about ideas.</v>

826
00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:30.180
<v Speaker 4>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're just going to retreat into </v>

827
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:30.180
<v Speaker 4>your identity and there's no way for me </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have a discussion with you.</v>

828
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just had a talk at Yukon and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the students got up and was </v>

829
00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:35.680
<v Speaker 4>talking about abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then she said,</v>

830
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

831
00:37:36.631 --> 00:37:39.850
<v Speaker 4>I would never have an abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you as a white privileged male,</v>

832
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.130
<v Speaker 4>how could you talk about abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

833
00:37:42.131 --> 00:37:43.990
<v Speaker 4>because right is right and wrong is </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

834
00:37:43.991 --> 00:37:46.480
<v Speaker 4>Regardless of whether I am a white </v>
<v Speaker 4>privileged male.</v>

835
00:37:46.481 --> 00:37:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the basis for western </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>

836
00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.370
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise we can't have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't have a conversation.</v>

837
00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Then what happens if we can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation across groups and we just </v>

838
00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 4>fight for dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly well that,</v>

839
00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.390
<v Speaker 4>and that's the postmodern worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all we're doing.</v>

840
00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:02.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>

841
00:38:02.801 --> 00:38:04.960
<v Speaker 4>but like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

842
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:10.010
<v Speaker 4>you're opening the door to the radical </v>
<v Speaker 4>right wingers because they're going to </v>

843
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.010
<v Speaker 4>come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

844
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.010
<v Speaker 4>no problem.</v>

845
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.850
<v Speaker 4>We'll play identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not losing.</v>

846
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.380
<v Speaker 4>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

847
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't the way you're supposed to </v>

848
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 4>play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to be guilty.</v>

849
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

850
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be guilty.</v>

851
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to be dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

852
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:26.341
<v Speaker 4>This is the danger of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>outright because with the own right is </v>

853
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:26.341
<v Speaker 4>reactionary identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>

854
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:31.051
<v Speaker 4>movements and left doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>acknowledge its own role in helping to </v>

855
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:31.051
<v Speaker 4>drive the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the emergence of,</v>

856
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:32.120
<v Speaker 4>of a reaction or identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement,</v>

857
00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:37.170
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find despicable because I think all </v>

858
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:37.170
<v Speaker 4>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>movements,</v>

859
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:37.170
<v Speaker 4>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly</v>

860
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 1>what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right or left.</v>

861
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I did a year of shows on if the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't clean them when I was still </v>

862
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.660
<v Speaker 1>saying I'm on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't clean up our house,</v>

863
00:38:44.661 --> 00:38:47.420
<v Speaker 1>what is going to happen and look what </v>
<v Speaker 1>has happened.</v>

864
00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.330
<v Speaker 1>So shifting slightly a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this would be interesting.</v>

865
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Is there a criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I'll start with you for using </v>

866
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.971
<v Speaker 1>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a criticism of you that you </v>

867
00:38:57.971 --> 00:38:57.971
<v Speaker 1>think is the most legit?</v>

868
00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:03.800
<v Speaker 3>No criticism of me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

869
00:39:03.801 --> 00:39:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

870
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.350
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

871
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:12.620
<v Speaker 3>the criticism of me that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>legit is one that I think is probably </v>

872
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:12.620
<v Speaker 3>common to most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I,</v>

873
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.240
<v Speaker 3>I tend to fall into confirmation bias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is true for everybody.</v>

874
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

875
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:17.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

876
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.420
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

877
00:39:18.421 --> 00:39:23.421
<v Speaker 3>when you're in the political realm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the easiest thing to do is to find </v>

878
00:39:23.421 --> 00:39:26.091
<v Speaker 3>evidence that supports your position and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cherry pick the evidence in order to </v>

879
00:39:26.091 --> 00:39:28.461
<v Speaker 3>support that position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if the idea is that I tend to do </v>

880
00:39:28.461 --> 00:39:29.340
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to fight that,</v>

881
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.150
<v Speaker 3>but I'll acknowledge that that's a flaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I have a,</v>

882
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.630
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

883
00:39:33.631 --> 00:39:35.400
<v Speaker 3>when you're invested in a political </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

884
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.700
<v Speaker 3>that the easy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your easiest mode of confrontation </v>

885
00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.031
<v Speaker 3>is to find stuff that supports what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>already think as opposed to taking in </v>

886
00:39:44.031 --> 00:39:47.780
<v Speaker 3>all of the available evidence and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting every point as we were talking </v>

887
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:47.780
<v Speaker 3>about before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

888
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:47.780
<v Speaker 3>toward the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toward the right position.</v>

889
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because I think it is a weakness.</v>

890
00:39:50.071 --> 00:39:55.071
<v Speaker 3>It's something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I tried to fight as often as </v>

891
00:39:55.071 --> 00:39:55.071
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

892
00:39:55.071 --> 00:39:55.071
<v Speaker 3>I tried to make provision for that.</v>

893
00:39:55.071 --> 00:39:57.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so before I ask you yours,</v>

894
00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:57.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

895
00:39:57.881 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I think,</v>

896
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:59.800
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think,</v>

897
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.590
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is wrong in the band?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

898
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is psychologically the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best way to deal with that?</v>

899
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:06.760
<v Speaker 1>To be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be aware,</v>

900
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:09.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're being aware of what your issues,</v>

901
00:40:09.521 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 1>limitations are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your biases might be,</v>

902
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.570
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to</v>

903
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:18.830
<v Speaker 5>yourself with competent people who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who have their areas of expertise that </v>

904
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.430
<v Speaker 5>aren't yours and to listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

905
00:40:20.431 --> 00:40:22.590
<v Speaker 5>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's helped me over the last 15 months</v>

906
00:40:22.591 --> 00:40:24.360
<v Speaker 5>because I've had about 10 people around </v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

907
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.000
<v Speaker 5>five of them are family members,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about five of them were friends who were</v>

908
00:40:27.001 --> 00:40:32.001
<v Speaker 5>extraordinarily competent people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they go over what I've been doing and </v>

909
00:40:32.001 --> 00:40:33.270
<v Speaker 5>they don't pull any punches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This feelings thing,</v>

910
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:38.420
<v Speaker 5>this is something I'd like to spring to </v>
<v Speaker 5>your defense about because the rule if </v>

911
00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.900
<v Speaker 5>you don't have an ethic is don't hurt </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyone's feelings.</v>

912
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.470
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

913
00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:42.660
<v Speaker 5>but which feelings do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

914
00:40:42.661 --> 00:40:47.661
<v Speaker 5>Like this seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feelings or do you mean the person's </v>

915
00:40:47.661 --> 00:40:49.530
<v Speaker 5>wellbeing across a year?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because lots of times when you're having</v>

916
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:52.860
<v Speaker 5>a firm discussion with someone that </v>
<v Speaker 5>upsets them in the present.</v>

917
00:40:52.861 --> 00:40:55.140
<v Speaker 5>This happens with children all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is you're.</v>

918
00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:00.240
<v Speaker 5>You're not taking stock of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>feelings at the moment except insofar as</v>

919
00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:05.241
<v Speaker 5>you have to because you want to help </v>
<v Speaker 5>prevent them from cascading into </v>

920
00:41:05.241 --> 00:41:06.120
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For the rest of their life,</v>

921
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.630
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

922
00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:11.631
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to discipline you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right and I'm going to tell you why you </v>

923
00:41:11.631 --> 00:41:13.791
<v Speaker 5>were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have a hard conversation </v>

924
00:41:13.791 --> 00:41:15.680
<v Speaker 5>because if you keep that up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your life is going to be a never ending </v>

925
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:15.680
<v Speaker 5>stream of misery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

926
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.881
<v Speaker 5>that's not cruel and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because people don't see the ethic </v>

927
00:41:20.191 --> 00:41:22.530
<v Speaker 5>of iterated games,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say something like that.</v>

928
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

929
00:41:23.221 --> 00:41:25.260
<v Speaker 5>you just shouldn't hurt anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 5>feelings in the moment.</v>

930
00:41:25.261 --> 00:41:27.540
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

931
00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I think both you and I </v>

932
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 3>object to the whole idea of the pleasure</v>
<v Speaker 3>pain matrix being the,</v>

933
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that matters</v>

934
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:39.250
<v Speaker 4>in terms of human happiness and because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom line is that you may be </v>

935
00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:39.710
<v Speaker 4>experiencing a good deal of pain right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

936
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 4>but that's going to lead to a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>fulfilled life.</v>

937
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.380
<v Speaker 4>That's the utility of sacrifice because </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone knows that give up something </v>

938
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 4>now in a rather painful way and you may </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit in the future.</v>

939
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pain,</v>

940
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 4>the pain pleasures ethic doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the problem of time.</v>

941
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.610
<v Speaker 4>Exactly on time and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another reason that doesn't work.</v>

942
00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

943
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.850
<v Speaker 4>you need a way more sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution to that.</v>

944
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now let's turn that question to you.</v>

945
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 4>What do you think is the most legit </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticism that you see?</v>

946
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Because I see a lot of blue check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

947
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.390
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people with 5,000</v>

948
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 4>followers just attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

949
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Very rarely about your idea though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll just make up something.</v>

950
00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.950
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson says dogs are blue and </v>
<v Speaker 4>green,</v>

951
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at somebody.</v>

952
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Somebody basically did that and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>invited him on the show to talk to you.</v>

953
00:42:22.851 --> 00:42:27.851
<v Speaker 4>And then of course he disappeared for I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say I have some problem with mood </v>

954
00:42:27.851 --> 00:42:27.851
<v Speaker 4>regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

955
00:42:27.851 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 4>And so sometimes I'm more irritable than</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be.</v>

956
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.260
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

957
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.770
<v Speaker 4>I come across.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

958
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably am more angry than is optimal</v>

959
00:42:37.851 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Speaker 4>in the circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

960
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:44.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the rules of English common law </v>

961
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.601
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you're more or less allowed to </v>

962
00:42:46.601 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 4>defend yourself with minimum necessary </v>
<v Speaker 4>force.</v>

963
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:52.090
<v Speaker 4>And I've had to practice and practice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and practice to use the minimum </v>

964
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.920
<v Speaker 4>necessary for if you really want to hit </v>
<v Speaker 4>him right now.</v>

965
00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Like that is the temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

966
00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 4>I think we all struggle with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's certain times or somebody</v>

967
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:00.830
<v Speaker 4>says something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

968
00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:01.820
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

969
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certain questions that get asked</v>

970
00:43:04.311 --> 00:43:08.150
<v Speaker 4>and it's just a slow pitch softball </v>
<v Speaker 4>right down the center of the plate.</v>

971
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I need to,</v>

972
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.570
<v Speaker 4>do I need to hit this soft ball as hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>as I possibly can,</v>

973
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.770
<v Speaker 4>especially rough if you have a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>humor too.</v>

974
00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:19.620
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

975
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.010
<v Speaker 4>it's really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have learned this.</v>

976
00:43:22.011 --> 00:43:26.810
<v Speaker 4>It's really useful to not defend </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself to vociferously,</v>

977
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.960
<v Speaker 4>which is weird because you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you have the right to defend </v>

978
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:31.960
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like no all,</v>

979
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.090
<v Speaker 4>no holds barred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

980
00:43:32.091 --> 00:43:33.630
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually doesn't work that way,</v>

981
00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:37.430
<v Speaker 4>that you have to defend yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 4>minimal necessary force.</v>

982
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.460
<v Speaker 4>And I think I managed that in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>channel for interview,</v>

983
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:41.310
<v Speaker 4>for Shank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go on.</v>

984
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have been talking to me about </v>

985
00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.361
<v Speaker 4>that nonstop for 15 months and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening and it wouldn't work as well </v>

986
00:43:49.361 --> 00:43:51.440
<v Speaker 4>if he hadn't done that or if he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>shall actor.</v>

987
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:56.990
<v Speaker 4>If he just gotten right at her and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you are saying is so stupid for </v>

988
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.100
<v Speaker 4>these five reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would.</v>

989
00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:02.140
<v Speaker 4>It would have been bad I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the fact that you sat there and </v>

990
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:02.140
<v Speaker 4>he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

991
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.551
<v Speaker 4>you're asking good questions and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know the fact that you're asking good </v>

992
00:44:06.551 --> 00:44:06.560
<v Speaker 4>questions demonstrates the invalidity of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your entire field.</v>

993
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.370
<v Speaker 4>That that was much more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

994
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's one of the things I've been </v>

995
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.511
<v Speaker 4>meditating on for the last years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a line in the new testament </v>

996
00:44:16.511 --> 00:44:16.511
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>resist not evil.</v>

997
00:44:16.511 --> 00:44:17.260
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

998
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.460
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

999
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:23.470
<v Speaker 4>what the hell you're supposed to apply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like because it's really a </v>

1000
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:27.101
<v Speaker 4>difficult thing to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really mean that you don't resist </v>

1001
00:44:27.101 --> 00:44:27.101
<v Speaker 4>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1002
00:44:27.101 --> 00:44:31.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of problems is if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>punch back then you have a fight.</v>

1003
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't just not defend yourself </v>

1004
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.581
<v Speaker 5>like weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't be weak and not defend </v>

1005
00:44:40.581 --> 00:44:42.831
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can be strong and defend </v>

1006
00:44:42.831 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 5>yourself minimally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's a real art.</v>

1007
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:46.830
<v Speaker 5>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the essence of sophistication.</v>

1008
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not,</v>

1009
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I come from kind of a rough place.</v>

1010
00:44:50.911 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm coming from northern Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I come from the frontier,</v>

1011
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:58.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and my town was scraped out of the </v>

1012
00:44:58.251 --> 00:44:58.251
<v Speaker 5>bloody prairie 50 years before people </v>
<v Speaker 5>move before,</v>

1013
00:44:58.251 --> 00:45:00.090
<v Speaker 5>before I lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1014
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1015
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.980
<v Speaker 5>it's been an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been a continual challenge to </v>

1016
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:11.280
<v Speaker 5>adjust my sophistication to the level of</v>
<v Speaker 5>challenge and I've,</v>

1017
00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to do that.</v>

1018
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't always manage it.</v>

1019
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to that point,</v>

1020
00:45:16.181 --> 00:45:21.181
<v Speaker 1>do you think that we sometimes actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a deep level use identity politics </v>

1021
00:45:21.701 --> 00:45:23.620
<v Speaker 1>against ourselves in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this regard?</v>

1022
00:45:23.621 --> 00:45:27.880
<v Speaker 1>So you're sitting across from Kathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's female at some level.</v>

1023
00:45:27.881 --> 00:45:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you may be moderated it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that?</v>

1024
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Because had it been a male and you talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this often,</v>

1025
00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:39.481
<v Speaker 1>that we have to act differently towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>males and females and there's a </v>

1026
00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:42.181
<v Speaker 1>physical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's physical reasons for that and </v>

1027
00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:42.181
<v Speaker 1>biological reasons for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that had she been a male,</v>

1028
00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:43.750
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the same exact age from you,</v>

1029
00:45:43.751 --> 00:45:48.751
<v Speaker 1>from Alberta and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps your response might have </v>

1030
00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:50.780
<v Speaker 1>been a little more forceful even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

1031
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:55.030
<v Speaker 1>We're all agreeing your response was </v>
<v Speaker 1>done correctly and even handedly.</v>

1032
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:56.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1033
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.830
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to say,</v>

1034
00:45:57.831 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 5>but probably yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

1035
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you like,</v>

1036
00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:07.420
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that you can say that you </v>

1037
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.600
<v Speaker 5>fight with a woman the same way that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight with a man.</v>

1038
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.750
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean you can't fight with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>woman.</v>

1039
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:15.770
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't mean you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think the rules are the </v>

1040
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.770
<v Speaker 5>same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1041
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:16.220
<v Speaker 5>why are the rules different?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1042
00:46:16.221 --> 00:46:19.340
<v Speaker 5>some of the rules are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a physical limit.</v>

1043
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:21.800
<v Speaker 5>It's much more stringent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1044
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:26.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a level of hinting out </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical threat that you can bring to </v>

1045
00:46:27.981 --> 00:46:32.981
<v Speaker 5>bear in a conversation between men that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you cannot bring to bear in a </v>

1046
00:46:32.981 --> 00:46:33.890
<v Speaker 5>conversation with a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1047
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:39.070
<v Speaker 5>and the mechanics of that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very subtle and difficult and it's </v>

1048
00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:43.421
<v Speaker 5>especially challenging in an </v>
<v Speaker 5>intellectual discussion because an </v>

1049
00:46:43.421 --> 00:46:47.291
<v Speaker 5>intellectual discussion is a kind of war</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it isn't obvious how men and women </v>

1050
00:46:47.291 --> 00:46:48.380
<v Speaker 5>should go to war with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>

1051
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:51.060
<v Speaker 5>We don't know how to sort that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>

1052
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:56.260
<v Speaker 5>My sense has been on the panels that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done is that I definitely have to </v>

1053
00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.800
<v Speaker 5>pull my punches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm on a panel with women,</v>

1054
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:05.950
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean that I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean that it's any less </v>

1055
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.670
<v Speaker 5>challenging intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the strategy and the attitude has to</v>

1056
00:47:07.671 --> 00:47:12.671
<v Speaker 5>be different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's much more likely that you'll be </v>

1057
00:47:12.671 --> 00:47:16.511
<v Speaker 5>seen as a bully if you bring the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>force to bear on a female opponent as </v>

1058
00:47:16.511 --> 00:47:18.080
<v Speaker 5>you would on a male opponent.</v>

1059
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm wondering if Hillary Clinton is a</v>

1060
00:47:20.781 --> 00:47:22.460
<v Speaker 1>perfect example of this in the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>sphere.</v>

1061
00:47:22.461 --> 00:47:27.461
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rebecca [inaudible] and hilary was </v>

1062
00:47:27.461 --> 00:47:27.461
<v Speaker 1>running for Senate in New York and </v>
<v Speaker 1>riskalyze.</v>

1063
00:47:27.461 --> 00:47:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Lazio walk across the stage and asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>her to sign a piece of paper and like </v>

1064
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:30.570
<v Speaker 1>them</v>

1065
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 3>headlines where they basically assaulted</v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

1066
00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if Rick Lazio had walked across stage</v>

1067
00:47:34.061 --> 00:47:35.440
<v Speaker 3>another man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's said sentence piece of paper,</v>

1068
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:40.441
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a tough guy look at that he's </v>

1069
00:47:40.441 --> 00:47:40.441
<v Speaker 3>willing to stand up to him.</v>

1070
00:47:40.441 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 1>So I suspect in that case your answer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this question is no.</v>

1071
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:46.951
<v Speaker 1>You would treat people the same if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Piers Morgan that night had been </v>

1072
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have done the exact same.</v>

1073
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was,</v>

1074
00:47:48.251 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 3>I was actually relatively polite to </v>
<v Speaker 3>peers.</v>

1075
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 3>So it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1076
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1077
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:54.430
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to be as polite as possible unless</v>

1078
00:47:54.431 --> 00:47:58.180
<v Speaker 3>the person is being very impolite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case I'm happy to go employed.</v>

1079
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:59.800
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to,</v>

1080
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:02.200
<v Speaker 3>instead of trying to gauge sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1081
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:07.490
<v Speaker 3>we're doing the same thing just from </v>
<v Speaker 3>different directions instead of trying </v>

1082
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.580
<v Speaker 3>to determine how I engage with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person by all of the various,</v>

1083
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1084
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.480
<v Speaker 3>I let them take the first punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically you take the first step in the</v>

1085
00:48:13.481 --> 00:48:15.360
<v Speaker 3>waltz and then I'll respond in kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>

1086
00:48:15.361 --> 00:48:20.361
<v Speaker 3>if you wanna if you wanna act polite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm happy to act polite with you </v>

1087
00:48:20.361 --> 00:48:21.790
<v Speaker 3>and I'm happy to have a nice cordial </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

1088
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:24.280
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get nasty then we'll get </v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty and we'll do that.</v>

1089
00:48:24.281 --> 00:48:29.281
<v Speaker 3>And I prep for interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm happy if you want to go into </v>

1090
00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:29.281
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to go to the mind.</v>

1091
00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:29.281
<v Speaker 3>We can do that.</v>

1092
00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to circle back to something </v>

1093
00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:33.780
<v Speaker 1>related to religion that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wanted to get to earlier,</v>

1094
00:48:33.781 --> 00:48:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a lot here.</v>

1095
00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's any difference or </v>

1096
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:41.110
<v Speaker 1>do you both think there's any </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference?</v>

1097
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Ben's belief in Ben's Jewish and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief is Christian comes from the </v>

1098
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Christian tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Does that matter at hall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever differences there are in that </v>

1100
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:53.600
<v Speaker 1>little place where you're both saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1101
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:58.700
<v Speaker 1>we see the reasons why our morals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics and all that come from this </v>

1102
00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:58.700
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So acknowledging,</v>

1103
00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1104
00:48:59.461 --> 00:49:04.461
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real world and biology and all of </v>

1105
00:49:04.461 --> 00:49:04.950
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever differences you may have,</v>

1106
00:49:04.951 --> 00:49:09.951
<v Speaker 1>which I don't even know that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that any of the three of us know what </v>

1107
00:49:09.951 --> 00:49:09.951
<v Speaker 1>those differences are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they even matter?</v>

1108
00:49:09.951 --> 00:49:11.060
<v Speaker 3>They might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1109
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.650
<v Speaker 3>That would be a lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to figure out if there are,</v>

1110
00:49:13.651 --> 00:49:14.870
<v Speaker 3>if there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it depends.</v>

1111
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.000
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on the brand of religion that</v>

1112
00:49:18.001 --> 00:49:19.400
<v Speaker 3>a person is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is espousing.</v>

1113
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's just,</v>

1114
00:49:20.431 --> 00:49:21.860
<v Speaker 1>let's just do this with youtube.</v>

1115
00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my,</v>

1116
00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.750
<v Speaker 3>my feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm writing a book on this right now</v>

1117
00:49:25.751 --> 00:49:26.890
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1118
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:31.950
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are certain principles that </v>

1119
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.691
<v Speaker 3>obviously under the Christianity that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are from the Judaic tradition and that </v>

1120
00:49:33.691 --> 00:49:35.140
<v Speaker 3>clearly the first manifestation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prophetic tradition.</v>

1121
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1122
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:41.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially an attempt to merge </v>

1123
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Jerusalem with Athens is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is I think the,</v>

1124
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 3>the book of John is the most obvious </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of using the logo says as sort </v>

1125
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 3>of the unifying feature and writing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing in Greek.</v>

1126
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was not the,</v>

1127
00:49:47.871 --> 00:49:48.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1128
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 3>the Lingua Franca of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was not what people were speaking,</v>

1129
00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 3>excepted and educated circles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm all the Judaic principles,</v>

1130
00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:01.240
<v Speaker 3>things like a god involved in history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a god who cares about individuals,</v>

1131
00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:06.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the notion that you have a choice </v>

1132
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.410
<v Speaker 3>between good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so choose good,</v>

1133
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:10.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that and so that you will live long </v>

1134
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.010
<v Speaker 3>on the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1135
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.010
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things were taken forward into</v>

1136
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The major distinctions in terms of,</v>

1137
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:15.370
<v Speaker 3>of Christianity versus Judaism are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that,</v>

1138
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:20.540
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on your interpretation of </v>

1139
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.141
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Early Christianity sort of suggested </v>

1140
00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:23.821
<v Speaker 3>that history had ended with Christ and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then in later kind of iterations of </v>

1141
00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Christianity that was moved beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1142
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:29.851
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that history had ended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was that Christ come back when </v>

1143
00:50:29.851 --> 00:50:29.851
<v Speaker 3>history had reached its logical </v>
<v Speaker 3>progression.</v>

1144
00:50:29.851 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 3>The progression of history didn't end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but original messianism was,</v>

1145
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:33.690
<v Speaker 3>this is the Messiah were done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1146
00:50:33.691 --> 00:50:35.570
<v Speaker 3>History is over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a millennialist religion.</v>

1147
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 3>It depends on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every few people think that that's </v>

1148
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.791
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is why I'm trying to </v>

1149
00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:42.791
<v Speaker 3>distinguish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1150
00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:45.040
<v Speaker 3>brands of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because obviously there are serious </v>

1151
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.490
<v Speaker 3>differences even in basic root level </v>
<v Speaker 3>between Catholicism and calvinism.</v>

1152
00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:48.740
<v Speaker 3>And lutheranism and all these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>have different iterations.</v>

1153
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:52.850
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my very strong belief in freewill and my</v>

1154
00:50:52.851 --> 00:50:57.851
<v Speaker 3>actual building of a moral system in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Judaism is building moral system on the </v>

1155
00:50:57.851 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 3>notion of free will obviously runs </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly counter to,</v>

1156
00:50:58.581 --> 00:50:59.480
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calvinism.</v>

1157
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Calvinism suggest that freewill is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a miracle and there's no basis for it</v>

1158
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:09.191
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that God grants you grace based on what </v>

1159
00:51:09.191 --> 00:51:11.861
<v Speaker 3>he wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it depends on the brand of </v>

1160
00:51:11.861 --> 00:51:14.051
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that overall the conflict </v>

1161
00:51:14.051 --> 00:51:15.920
<v Speaker 3>between Christianity and Judaism in </v>
<v Speaker 3>large measure is,</v>

1162
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.580
<v Speaker 3>especially in the early conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was political rather than ideological </v>

1163
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.931
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of ways it was a new religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempting to establish its own footing </v>

1164
00:51:25.931 --> 00:51:29.711
<v Speaker 3>and was angry that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Jews would not join this new </v>

1165
00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:32.620
<v Speaker 3>religion and leave behind tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there are certain ways in </v>

1166
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 3>which Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1167
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.990
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1168
00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:36.610
<v Speaker 3>the main distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

1169
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:41.630
<v Speaker 3>Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people usually make is that </v>

1170
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.630
<v Speaker 3>Christianity is a great space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Religion and Judaism is a religion.</v>

1171
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Meaning the Judaism says you sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>earn your way into heaven,</v>

1172
00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You earn your way toward a better life,</v>

1173
00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1174
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:49.150
<v Speaker 3>and Christianity says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you believe right,</v>

1175
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I am the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth and the life.</v>

1176
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.320
<v Speaker 3>If you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're good.</v>

1177
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:55.940
<v Speaker 3>But the truth is that Christianity sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of back doors,</v>

1178
00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.100
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Judaic view by saying,</v>

1179
00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:03.250
<v Speaker 3>if you really do believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to act in these </v>

1180
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.261
<v Speaker 3>particular ways to demonstrate your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this weird paradoxical </v>

1181
00:52:05.261 --> 00:52:07.040
<v Speaker 3>relationship between the idea of belief </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Christianity,</v>

1182
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:12.041
<v Speaker 3>the belief that that Christ came to save</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone from their sins and that all </v>

1183
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:12.950
<v Speaker 3>you have to do is admit that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>redeemed.</v>

1184
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Like there's symbolic truth to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would take a long time to unpack,</v>

1185
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:21.490
<v Speaker 3>but there's also an injunction goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>along with that to imitate Christ in </v>

1186
00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:21.490
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1187
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a lot of these distinctions </v>
<v Speaker 3>are almost,</v>

1188
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.140
<v Speaker 3>some of them are almost a little false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1189
00:52:27.141 --> 00:52:32.141
<v Speaker 3>meaning that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're either a Christian misreads of </v>

1190
00:52:32.141 --> 00:52:32.141
<v Speaker 3>Judaism or Jewish misreads of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Christianity,</v>

1191
00:52:32.141 --> 00:52:33.110
<v Speaker 3>and that when you get to the root of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1192
00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:38.111
<v Speaker 3>this is what my mom says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are significant differences </v>

1193
00:52:38.111 --> 00:52:40.751
<v Speaker 3>between Judaism and Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his view of Christianity from the </v>

1194
00:52:40.751 --> 00:52:43.031
<v Speaker 3>Jewish historical point of view is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Judaism was never bound to convert </v>

1195
00:52:43.031 --> 00:52:46.690
<v Speaker 3>billions of people around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Christianity was specifically </v>

1196
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.210
<v Speaker 3>because we have a lot of crap we got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1197
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jews have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have 613 commandments,</v>

1198
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gotta we have to keep kosher.</v>

1199
00:52:51.891 --> 00:52:54.680
<v Speaker 3>We have to do all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate you doing a lot of them for</v>

1200
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:55.110
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1201
00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:56.800
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And taking care of it.</v>

1202
00:52:56.801 --> 00:52:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1203
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll transfer over the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you one of my afterlife </v>

1204
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:02.670
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1205
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.410
<v Speaker 3>but I think that Christianity ends up </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a lot of those same things that,</v>

1206
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:12.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were supposed to be start </v>

1207
00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:12.060
<v Speaker 3>distinctions just under a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>guise.</v>

1208
00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.730
<v Speaker 3>So when it comes to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why in the modern world when the</v>

1209
00:53:13.731 --> 00:53:16.440
<v Speaker 3>discrimination between from Christians </v>
<v Speaker 3>toward Jews largely has,</v>

1210
00:53:16.441 --> 00:53:21.441
<v Speaker 3>has ended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what you're seeing is this </v>

1211
00:53:21.441 --> 00:53:23.260
<v Speaker 3>tremendous confluence between </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly orthodox Jews and observant</v>

1212
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Christians on matters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on matters of values,</v>

1213
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:31.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because once Christianity and in the </v>

1214
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.760
<v Speaker 3>late 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Mid Twentieth Century in America </v>

1215
00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.221
<v Speaker 3>more broadly with Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because American Christianity is very </v>

1216
00:53:37.221 --> 00:53:37.221
<v Speaker 3>different than European Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>

1217
00:53:37.221 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 3>once there was an idea that Jews were </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the enemy to be converted,</v>

1218
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 3>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you still want to convert me,</v>

1219
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.790
<v Speaker 3>but we're not going to come at you with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a knife.</v>

1220
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 3>We're going to come at you with the book</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we share a common framework for</v>

1221
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:53.510
<v Speaker 3>how the world is supposed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You may not agree with the second half </v>

1222
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.510
<v Speaker 3>of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1223
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:57.471
<v Speaker 3>And then I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's created a pretty good working </v>

1224
00:53:57.471 --> 00:54:00.621
<v Speaker 3>relationship with [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I'm struggling to come up </v>

1225
00:54:00.621 --> 00:54:00.720
<v Speaker 3>with what are the significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

1226
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:05.870
<v Speaker 3>And so I need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a Christian to tell me what is </v>

1227
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.870
<v Speaker 3>the significant difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can argue with that question because I</v>

1228
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.960
<v Speaker 3>know my own religion better than I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marshall question is being,</v>

1229
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:12.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if the rule that the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>plays in Judaism and Christianity is the</v>

1230
00:54:12.841 --> 00:54:16.320
<v Speaker 3>same because I'm not sure what to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the.</v>

1231
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Like what I would say is the Jews put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of emphasis on the </v>

1232
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.210
<v Speaker 3>state as a mechanism for salvation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1233
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:29.210
<v Speaker 3>That might be the symbolic idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlies the establishment of Israel </v>

1234
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.750
<v Speaker 3>and I would say that in Christianity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nation,</v>

1235
00:54:30.751 --> 00:54:33.360
<v Speaker 3>or you mean like the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the nation,</v>

1236
00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:35.670
<v Speaker 3>but then it gets tangled up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1237
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:36.210
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1238
00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1239
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a distinction that Jay,</v>

1240
00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.340
<v Speaker 3>that Christianity is a universal </v>
<v Speaker 3>universalistic religion,</v>

1241
00:54:41.341 --> 00:54:46.341
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that it that in the Kingdom </v>

1242
00:54:46.341 --> 00:54:46.341
<v Speaker 3>of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone is Christian basically,</v>

1243
00:54:46.341 --> 00:54:50.180
<v Speaker 3>and Judaism is not in one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is another which is that God </v>

1244
00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:54.411
<v Speaker 3>identifies a nation that he treasures as</v>
<v Speaker 3>his own and he has a special </v>

1245
00:54:54.411 --> 00:54:54.690
<v Speaker 3>relationship with that nation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Judaism is not exclusive.</v>

1246
00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 3>This with regard to who gets into </v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven.</v>

1247
00:54:56.281 --> 00:55:01.281
<v Speaker 3>So there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this basic idea in a in genesis </v>

1248
00:55:01.281 --> 00:55:02.820
<v Speaker 3>that there are commandments that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>given prior to the giving of the Torah,</v>

1249
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there's the call,</v>

1250
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 3>the Sheva Mitzvah Day and off the seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>commandments that are given to the sons </v>

1251
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 3>of Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning all mankind.</v>

1252
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 3>And these are things like no murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no idolatry,</v>

1253
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:16.790
<v Speaker 3>no adultery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They basically mirror a lot of the 10 </v>

1254
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:18.060
<v Speaker 3>commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea in Judaism is that God,</v>

1255
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:23.150
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a priestly cased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God chose this specific group of people </v>

1256
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:26.210
<v Speaker 3>to be a light unto the nations by </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrating what a godly lifestyle </v>

1257
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:29.511
<v Speaker 3>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you dedicate every aspect of your </v>

1258
00:55:29.511 --> 00:55:29.511
<v Speaker 3>life to God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he said to everybody else,</v>

1259
00:55:29.511 --> 00:55:31.590
<v Speaker 3>I know not everybody else is up to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I and in fact Judy's are supposed to</v>

1260
00:55:31.591 --> 00:55:33.570
<v Speaker 3>try and turn away conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>

1261
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.600
<v Speaker 3>but you can still get into heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that we are trying to force </v>

1262
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.660
<v Speaker 3>anyone into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into being Jewish,</v>

1263
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:42.590
<v Speaker 3>that that's not a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So nationalism without version.</v>

1264
00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:47.610
<v Speaker 3>And think about that psychologically as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an attempt to both manage the </v>

1265
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.951
<v Speaker 3>preservation of group identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would be culture or cultural </v>

1266
00:55:51.951 --> 00:55:55.191
<v Speaker 3>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has some utility and also to be </v>

1267
00:55:55.191 --> 00:55:55.240
<v Speaker 3>able to coexist with other things.</v>

1268
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:57.290
<v Speaker 3>We're doing things in a different way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1269
00:55:57.310 --> 00:56:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Judaism has had a long history of of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like every other religion of sort </v>

1270
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:05.160
<v Speaker 3>of evolution on this stuff or like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the push of the book of Joshua,</v>

1271
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.680
<v Speaker 3>there's actual forest conversion that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens in the book of Joshua,</v>

1272
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:12.830
<v Speaker 3>but by the time you get to a mid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early Christianity and midpoint Judaism,</v>

1273
00:56:13.741 --> 00:56:15.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because Judaism and Christianity,</v>

1274
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.740
<v Speaker 3>then you're already talking about Jews </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are not looking to convert people.</v>

1275
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:21.480
<v Speaker 3>They sort of want to live in their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

1276
00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to bother anyone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the most part a.</v>

1277
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.490
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of like a tidal wave of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conquering Jews going out.</v>

1278
00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even to think about it now is hilarious,</v>

1279
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:30.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody thinks about it that way.</v>

1280
00:56:30.431 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Except if you're a conspiratorial nutbag</v>
<v Speaker 3>inquisitions usually work the other way.</v>

1281
00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:36.740
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1282
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:42.320
<v Speaker 5>so any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything that you might've heard Ben </v>

1283
00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.401
<v Speaker 5>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would any thing jive with the </v>

1284
00:56:44.401 --> 00:56:45.490
<v Speaker 5>fundamental belief that you have that </v>
<v Speaker 5>would cause a problem?</v>

1285
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:50.790
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like coding a problem in I think in </v>

1286
00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:53.880
<v Speaker 5>society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that one potential problem </v>

1287
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.731
<v Speaker 5>that's that's worth discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it would take forever to discuss it </v>

1288
00:56:56.731 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 5>is the relative role of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus the state.</v>

1289
00:56:57.830 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean you see this argued out in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>prophetic books and in the Old </v>

1290
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:08.050
<v Speaker 5>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's the Jewish state and </v>

1291
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:10.411
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of the central player in some </v>

1292
00:57:10.411 --> 00:57:13.231
<v Speaker 5>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's clear evidence that it can </v>

1293
00:57:13.231 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 5>become corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can fall away,</v>

1294
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:18.450
<v Speaker 5>and then a prophet who's an individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>has to step forward and re revivified </v>

1295
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:19.480
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1296
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:22.600
<v Speaker 5>and so there's tremendous emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the utility of the individual.</v>

1297
00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 5>You see that in Judaea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Judaism,</v>

1298
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:26.810
<v Speaker 5>I would say overall it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1299
00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.270
<v Speaker 5>it's a very cohesive.</v>

1300
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:29.500
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1301
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:32.470
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it promotes in group cohesion,</v>

1302
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:37.530
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also allows for individual </v>

1303
00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:39.691
<v Speaker 5>expression in a very interesting ways </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's tremendous emphasis in </v>

1304
00:57:39.691 --> 00:57:42.700
<v Speaker 5>Jewish culture on learning and an </v>
<v Speaker 5>articulation and mastery of ideas,</v>

1305
00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 5>and so that provides the space for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual to flourish.</v>

1306
00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:49.270
<v Speaker 5>With Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see more of a move away,</v>

1307
00:57:49.271 --> 00:57:54.271
<v Speaker 5>I would say from the idea of the state </v>
<v Speaker 5>now that's not necessarily without its </v>

1308
00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:56.260
<v Speaker 5>troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things you pointed out was,</v>

1309
00:57:56.261 --> 00:58:01.261
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as Christianity becomes more about the </v>

1310
00:58:01.261 --> 00:58:03.901
<v Speaker 5>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the religion itself tends to fragment </v>

1311
00:58:03.901 --> 00:58:06.961
<v Speaker 5>like it did with protestantism until </v>
<v Speaker 5>just fragments right to the point where </v>

1312
00:58:06.961 --> 00:58:09.991
<v Speaker 5>every individual is their own church and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you have no continuity and new </v>

1313
00:58:09.991 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 5>tradition and the Catholics were kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bulwark against that.</v>

1314
00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 5>But I do think that there's a discussion</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be had about the relative role of the</v>

1315
00:58:16.391 --> 00:58:21.391
<v Speaker 5>individual in redeeming the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say versus the state in redeeming </v>

1316
00:58:21.391 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would say the Christians come down</v>

1317
00:58:23.711 --> 00:58:28.711
<v Speaker 5>more strongly on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual and the Jews come down more </v>

1318
00:58:28.711 --> 00:58:31.651
<v Speaker 5>strongly on the side of the state now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm willing to be corrected about </v>

1319
00:58:31.651 --> 00:58:35.971
<v Speaker 5>that because I've never actually been </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to have a discussion with anyone </v>

1320
00:58:35.971 --> 00:58:35.971
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1321
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:37.440
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some truth to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1322
00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:39.120
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1323
00:58:39.121 --> 00:58:40.310
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Hebrew Ami,</v>

1324
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:43.260
<v Speaker 3>I like the idea of the nation of Israel </v>
<v Speaker 3>being paramount and when you pray,</v>

1325
00:58:43.261 --> 00:58:45.570
<v Speaker 3>you pray and collective terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't pray in individual terms,</v>

1326
00:58:45.571 --> 00:58:47.570
<v Speaker 3>everything is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is done in terms of inaccurate,</v>

1327
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:49.440
<v Speaker 3>in terms of we praying as a group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1328
00:58:49.441 --> 00:58:54.441
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to pray in a minion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you square that away in your </v>

1329
00:58:54.441 --> 00:58:54.441
<v Speaker 3>own ways?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you square that away?</v>

1330
00:58:54.441 --> 00:58:57.240
<v Speaker 3>As soon as there's a lot of enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of play in the joints.</v>

1331
00:58:57.241 --> 00:58:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1332
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.030
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take the most,</v>

1333
00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.540
<v Speaker 3>to take the most obvious example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1334
00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:03.090
<v Speaker 3>if you were talking about the power of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jewish state,</v>

1335
00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:04.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1336
00:59:04.171 --> 00:59:09.171
<v Speaker 3>in sort of biblical context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's tremendous argument between </v>

1337
00:59:09.171 --> 00:59:12.711
<v Speaker 3>whether a kingship is a good thing or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kingship is a bad thing in the Old </v>

1338
00:59:12.711 --> 00:59:12.711
<v Speaker 3>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1339
00:59:12.711 --> 00:59:12.711
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>

1340
00:59:12.711 --> 00:59:14.280
<v Speaker 3>it says like Samuel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Warren's the Jewish people,</v>

1341
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.400
<v Speaker 3>if you take a king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what's going to happen.</v>

1342
00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.760
<v Speaker 3>It's all going to suck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1343
00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:19.650
<v Speaker 3>And then they form a kingship and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck.</v>

1344
00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:24.980
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a strong case to made the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kingship was not actually what was </v>

1345
00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.731
<v Speaker 3>wanted because you have an entire period</v>
<v Speaker 3>of just judges and the judges are </v>

1346
00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:29.270
<v Speaker 3>legitimately just individuals who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trusted by the people,</v>

1347
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:34.300
<v Speaker 3>but then they can be supplanted at </v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime by another judge who's not from </v>

1348
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:34.300
<v Speaker 3>the lineage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1349
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when we say that that group identity </v>

1350
00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:40.390
<v Speaker 3>matters in Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it matters to the extent that you're </v>

1351
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.390
<v Speaker 3>following God's law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you stray away from that,</v>

1352
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:45.071
<v Speaker 3>the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Judaism has always said that </v>

1353
00:59:45.071 --> 00:59:45.071
<v Speaker 3>what you do is what makes you part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the group,</v>

1354
00:59:45.071 --> 00:59:47.420
<v Speaker 3>not what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Judaism has a weird dichotomy in it,</v>

1355
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:52.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's largely driven by exigent </v>

1356
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:54.911
<v Speaker 3>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the idea of biological Judaism </v>

1357
00:59:54.911 --> 00:59:54.911
<v Speaker 3>versus the idea of religious Judaism.</v>

1358
00:59:54.911 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 3>So I care very little about biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>Judaism,</v>

1359
00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 3>like when somebody says such and such as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish Noam Chomsky's Jewish,</v>

1360
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:01.400
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what I really don't care.</v>

1361
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.860
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that most orthodox Jews,</v>

1362
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:07.730
<v Speaker 3>we basically biological Judaism or your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mom was Jewish,</v>

1363
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:13.180
<v Speaker 3>which is the way that it works in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Orthodox Judaism is the sort of the </v>

1364
01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:17.080
<v Speaker 3>entry ticket to being Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning you have to either have </v>

1365
01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.201
<v Speaker 3>converted in or your mind has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish in order for you to become fully </v>

1366
01:00:20.201 --> 01:00:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the practice is what matters to me </v>

1367
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.140
<v Speaker 3>more than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where you get back into grey </v>

1368
01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:26.140
<v Speaker 3>space versus based a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1369
01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:30.440
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another place where the group </v>

1370
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:30.620
<v Speaker 3>identity issue becomes paramount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1371
01:00:30.621 --> 01:00:31.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this group,</v>

1372
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:33.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how has membership defined,</v>

1373
01:00:33.771 --> 01:00:36.080
<v Speaker 3>but let's say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's defined by ethnicity,</v>

1374
01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:39.800
<v Speaker 3>something which would be related to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>descent through the mother.</v>

1375
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's a problem.</v>

1376
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:45.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying it's uploaded demarcates.</v>

1377
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.100
<v Speaker 3>A group say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1378
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.650
<v Speaker 3>this is a group that only we can belong </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1379
01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:52.300
<v Speaker 3>What's weird is you can convert in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1380
01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:57.420
<v Speaker 3>I'd say when there's play in the joints,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the problems are solvable </v>

1381
01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:57.420
<v Speaker 3>through the idea that you can convert </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1382
01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Judaism says you can't convert out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then we don't punish people who </v>

1383
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:02.570
<v Speaker 3>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1384
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:02.660
<v Speaker 3>But is it right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is different than Islam,</v>

1385
01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.330
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a relatively important.</v>

1386
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.760
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the people who I worked with at </v>

1387
01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.100
<v Speaker 3>my company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrew Klavan is a guy who was born </v>

1388
01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Jewish and now is Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1389
01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:15.100
<v Speaker 3>So in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's Jewish,</v>

1390
01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.150
<v Speaker 3>but am I going to like drag him down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>my synagogue?</v>

1391
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

1392
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:23.100
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what the group identity </v>

1393
01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.720
<v Speaker 3>that the good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one thing I will say for a group </v>

1394
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.500
<v Speaker 3>identity is that what we have seen is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if there is lack of group identity,</v>

1395
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 3>that group identity is filled usually by</v>
<v Speaker 3>nefarious groups.</v>

1396
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that people do have a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of existing that you find your </v>

1397
01:01:36.051 --> 01:01:39.710
<v Speaker 3>meaning or your find your purpose or </v>
<v Speaker 3>your find your identity just in yourself</v>

1398
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:44.711
<v Speaker 3>as an individual is not only wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's belied by virtually all of human </v>

1399
01:01:44.711 --> 01:01:47.260
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make an argument for identity politics,</v>

1400
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 3>but the point that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1401
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.120
<v Speaker 3>but what Judaism does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what America does,</v>

1402
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.760
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find your identity in the ideas.</v>

1403
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference is when I'm.</v>

1404
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.080
<v Speaker 3>So this is what I don't care about </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological Judaism,</v>

1405
01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly the,</v>

1406
01:02:01.231 --> 01:02:06.231
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I care much more about the ideas that </v>

1407
01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:06.231
<v Speaker 3>you hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm in favor of group identity.</v>

1408
01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:07.820
<v Speaker 3>If group identity is built around a set </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ideas that are worth preserving,</v>

1409
01:02:07.821 --> 01:02:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in favor of group identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I am a conservative.</v>

1410
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 3>That's a group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1411
01:02:12.651 --> 01:02:14.690
<v Speaker 3>But that's an identifier more than it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>an identity.</v>

1412
01:02:14.691 --> 01:02:18.590
<v Speaker 3>Meaning it's a way of identifying me as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a person who thinks this way and because</v>

1413
01:02:18.591 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 3>I think there are differences in,</v>

1414
01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 4>in modes of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then those group identities.</v>

1415
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:24.390
<v Speaker 4>Do you matter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is why we get together.</v>

1416
01:02:24.391 --> 01:02:26.740
<v Speaker 4>This is why we have discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why we have friends,</v>

1417
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm glad you.</v>

1418
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad you said that the way you did </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I.</v>

1419
01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:36.001
<v Speaker 4>I try to challenge myself on that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time because I talk about the </v>

1420
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:39.141
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in the individual and I want </v>

1421
01:02:39.141 --> 01:02:39.520
<v Speaker 4>to make sure that I'm not going to let.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I,</v>

1422
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.600
<v Speaker 4>if we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is what I think is one of the </v>

1423
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:44.600
<v Speaker 4>things that's broken down is we used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a common purpose.</v>

1424
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.071
<v Speaker 4>Like I have this framework that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>working on in the book that I'm writing </v>

1425
01:02:49.071 --> 01:02:49.680
<v Speaker 4>where I basically say that in order for </v>
<v Speaker 4>an individual to be happy,</v>

1426
01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 4>you need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need four things.</v>

1427
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:54.060
<v Speaker 4>You need individual purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need individual capacity.</v>

1428
01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:59.061
<v Speaker 4>That the feeling that you can accomplish</v>
<v Speaker 4>that purpose or at least make moves in </v>

1429
01:02:59.061 --> 01:02:59.061
<v Speaker 4>that direction.</v>

1430
01:02:59.061 --> 01:03:02.720
<v Speaker 4>You need a communal purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do need to feel like you're part of </v>

1431
01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.481
<v Speaker 4>a group that's moving in the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction and you need to communal </v>

1432
01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.911
<v Speaker 4>capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which both allows the community to </v>

1433
01:03:07.911 --> 01:03:09.921
<v Speaker 4>activate together and also protects your</v>
<v Speaker 4>rights as an individual to do what you </v>

1434
01:03:09.921 --> 01:03:10.590
<v Speaker 4>want to do in pursuit of your individual</v>
<v Speaker 4>purpose.</v>

1435
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.740
<v Speaker 4>And that's the apotheosis of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I think the founding </v>

1436
01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:15.740
<v Speaker 4>fathers were trying to do in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>

1437
01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:20.091
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>set up a framework where you could </v>

1438
01:03:20.091 --> 01:03:21.560
<v Speaker 4>fulfill all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you do need the idea of communal </v>

1439
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.711
<v Speaker 4>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that's happened </v>

1440
01:03:24.711 --> 01:03:24.711
<v Speaker 4>post enlightenment is that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even think in terms of they either think</v>

1441
01:03:24.711 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 4>purely in terms of communal purpose or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not at all in terms of communal purpose,</v>

1442
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:32.750
<v Speaker 4>because they think either purely in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of communal purpose and that's </v>

1443
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:35.180
<v Speaker 4>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning I'm black for the black </v>

1444
01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:35.180
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should do x,</v>

1445
01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.660
<v Speaker 4>or I'm Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>therefore the Jewish community should do</v>

1446
01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:41.661
<v Speaker 4>x.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there are people who think not </v>

1447
01:03:41.661 --> 01:03:42.360
<v Speaker 4>in terms of communal purpose at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning full on libertarian.</v>

1448
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.360
<v Speaker 4>I make my own meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to have anything in </v>

1449
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:47.360
<v Speaker 4>common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have.</v>

1450
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:47.360
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a lie.</v>

1451
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.040
<v Speaker 4>Even Libertarians believe we have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have an idea of liberty and common live </v>

1452
01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.890
<v Speaker 4>with other people that were right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1453
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:54.330
<v Speaker 4>Harmoniously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when we don't,</v>

1454
01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:59.370
<v Speaker 4>and when we don't have any of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we don't have any sort of communal </v>

1455
01:03:59.370 --> 01:03:59.430
<v Speaker 4>purpose and we live with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people with whom we share nothing,</v>

1456
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 4>then it falls apart incredibly quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's,</v>

1457
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:06.500
<v Speaker 4>here's how the Christian drama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks to me it,</v>

1458
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:08.190
<v Speaker 4>it addresses this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1459
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:13.191
<v Speaker 4>So Christ is presented as a figure who </v>
<v Speaker 4>is an absolute master of his tradition,</v>

1460
01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:18.610
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's debating with the Jewish elders </v>

1461
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:21.201
<v Speaker 4>when he's 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So think about it psychologically is </v>

1462
01:04:21.201 --> 01:04:25.010
<v Speaker 4>first your child and you're dependent on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your parents and then you have to make </v>

1463
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:27.270
<v Speaker 4>the move from being a child dependent </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the world,</v>

1464
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.760
<v Speaker 4>but you don't move from child to </v>
<v Speaker 4>individually.</v>

1465
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.660
<v Speaker 4>You move from child to group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your teenage gang.</v>

1466
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:38.661
<v Speaker 4>That's your adolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to catalyze your group </v>

1467
01:04:38.661 --> 01:04:38.661
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have a group identity,</v>

1468
01:04:38.661 --> 01:04:41.130
<v Speaker 4>it's actually a developmental failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1469
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.840
<v Speaker 4>But then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well wait,</v>

1470
01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:46.620
<v Speaker 4>a second group identity is necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is it the highest?</v>

1471
01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:52.420
<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it represent the highest plane of </v>

1472
01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:52.420
<v Speaker 4>moral achievement?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The answer to that is no.</v>

1473
01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.450
<v Speaker 4>You have to emerge from your group as an</v>
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

1474
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:59.810
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now this is how I read the Christian </v>

1475
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:02.721
<v Speaker 4>story symbolically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a consequence most of have </v>

1476
01:05:02.721 --> 01:05:02.721
<v Speaker 4>having students studied young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1477
01:05:02.721 --> 01:05:04.620
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need group identity.</v>

1478
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.740
<v Speaker 4>That's the persona that you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where you have to have a persona.</v>

1479
01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:09.720
<v Speaker 4>You have to be able to wear a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be.</v>

1480
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.270
<v Speaker 4>You have to simplify yourself for other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1481
01:05:12.271 --> 01:05:14.920
<v Speaker 4>You have to be able to play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you're.</v>

1482
01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 4>You just have failed developmentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if</v>

1483
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.650
<v Speaker 5>you're only a persona,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that's a big problem,</v>

1484
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 5>partly because when the group goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>insane,</v>

1485
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:24.100
<v Speaker 5>so do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1486
01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.740
<v Speaker 5>now you got to emerge out of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1487
01:05:26.741 --> 01:05:29.860
<v Speaker 5>so now you need a symbol for what </v>
<v Speaker 5>emerges out of the group.</v>

1488
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.160
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so Christ is the symbol of what should </v>

1489
01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:35.160
<v Speaker 5>emerge out of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Speaking,</v>

1490
01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 5>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bear the tragedy of life.</v>

1491
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:42.280
<v Speaker 5>Speak the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be Willing to transform through death.</v>

1492
01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 5>That's the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm speaking purely psychologically.</v>

1493
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.910
<v Speaker 5>You learn something new,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you learn it,</v>

1494
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:52.870
<v Speaker 5>it makes you suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The part of you that's wrong has to die.</v>

1495
01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:54.880
<v Speaker 5>You have to let go of that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard,</v>

1496
01:05:54.881 --> 01:05:56.920
<v Speaker 5>especially maybe you learn something </v>
<v Speaker 5>profound.</v>

1497
01:05:56.921 --> 01:05:59.440
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you have to regrow and arm.</v>

1498
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.820
<v Speaker 5>It's really painful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1499
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:07.080
<v Speaker 5>but you identify with the part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself that transforms through </v>

1500
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.681
<v Speaker 5>voluntary acceptance of suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what Christ represents as a </v>

1501
01:06:10.681 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 5>symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that that's.</v>

1502
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.080
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Symbolically,</v>

1503
01:06:14.081 --> 01:06:17.410
<v Speaker 5>this is what actually severed the </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship between Human Freud,</v>

1504
01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:20.560
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because young laid out the,</v>

1505
01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:25.030
<v Speaker 5>his understanding of Christianity in </v>
<v Speaker 5>those terms and Freud,</v>

1506
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.070
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't a Jewish Christian thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>because Freud was really he,</v>

1507
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.380
<v Speaker 5>he was Jewish by ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

1508
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.010
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not at all.</v>

1509
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:36.190
<v Speaker 5>He just didn't want to have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do with religious ideation at all.</v>

1510
01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:41.191
<v Speaker 5>He thought that that would introduce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he called it like a tidal wave of black </v>

1511
01:06:41.191 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 5>title wave of cultism back into what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>regarded as a science.</v>

1512
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.760
<v Speaker 5>He had his point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think you've got the symbolic </v>

1513
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:47.760
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1514
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.930
<v Speaker 5>and so what does that mean in </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship to Christianity and </v>

1515
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 5>Judaism?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's really complicated?</v>

1516
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:57.451
<v Speaker 5>Because you have the prophetic tradition</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Judaism and the prophets are also </v>

1517
01:06:57.451 --> 01:07:01.500
<v Speaker 5>symbols of people who emerge from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pathological group who stepped forward </v>

1518
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 5>courageously and who reconstitute the </v>
<v Speaker 5>group.</v>

1519
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:09.070
<v Speaker 5>You believe these people could exist </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>

1520
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:10.740
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which people?</v>

1521
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:15.160
<v Speaker 5>The profits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think profits of sorts exist always.</v>

1522
01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 5>I think Dostoyevsky was a prophet niche.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was clearly a profit.</v>

1523
01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:21.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean he predicted it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen in the 20th century.</v>

1524
01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:26.490
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine predicting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason I asked that was because I </v>

1525
01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:26.490
<v Speaker 5>think when people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you say profits,</v>

1526
01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:31.471
<v Speaker 5>I think people think of someone coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>down from heaven and they're going to </v>

1527
01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:34.381
<v Speaker 5>have a halo on or some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you think that that's what I'm </v>

1528
01:07:34.381 --> 01:07:34.910
<v Speaker 5>trying to get to the right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

1529
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.450
<v Speaker 3>fully agree with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1530
01:07:36.451 --> 01:07:41.451
<v Speaker 3>I was my manatees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Manatees has an entire section in guide </v>

1531
01:07:41.451 --> 01:07:43.861
<v Speaker 3>for the perplexed about prophecy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he says is there's Moses level </v>

1532
01:07:43.861 --> 01:07:47.491
<v Speaker 3>prophecy which is the the legislating </v>
<v Speaker 3>profit which is and he says he's the </v>

1533
01:07:47.491 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 3>only legislating profit in the Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>

1534
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:53.130
<v Speaker 3>but all the other prophets are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who see things incredibly </v>

1535
01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:55.261
<v Speaker 3>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Essentially there are people who've </v>

1536
01:07:55.261 --> 01:07:55.261
<v Speaker 3>studied philosophy and who have studied </v>
<v Speaker 3>human morality and has studied the human</v>

1537
01:07:55.261 --> 01:07:57.850
<v Speaker 3>being and then that's the way down on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the iceberg.</v>

1538
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 3>That's just the thing that makes them </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1539
01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in that sentence,</v>

1540
01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:04.710
<v Speaker 3>people who predicted the thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1541
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.070
<v Speaker 3>providing a certain level of stability </v>
<v Speaker 3>for folks and we're,</v>

1542
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:08.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1543
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:13.110
<v Speaker 3>I think there are levels of prophecy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'll say and I think that the </v>

1544
01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:16.771
<v Speaker 3>better you are at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at recognizing human behavior and the </v>

1545
01:08:16.771 --> 01:08:16.771
<v Speaker 3>interplay of forces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better</v>

1546
01:08:16.771 --> 01:08:16.771
<v Speaker 4>you are at saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1547
01:08:16.771 --> 01:08:21.731
<v Speaker 4>here's what's going to happen next week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very difficult for anybody </v>

1548
01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:21.731
<v Speaker 4>to say here's what's going to happen a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred years.</v>

1549
01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Because if you could predict that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a lot in the stock market,</v>

1550
01:08:23.271 --> 01:08:25.580
<v Speaker 4>but I think that you can certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know as well,</v>

1551
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:30.330
<v Speaker 4>you can also get a sense of plate </v>
<v Speaker 4>tectonics like the details rob out.</v>

1552
01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.260
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's where we're at now.</v>

1553
01:08:32.261 --> 01:08:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Like I believe we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are in a war of ideas.</v>

1554
01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:35.820
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1555
01:08:36.150 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're at a point where we're debating </v>

1556
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:43.881
<v Speaker 4>the validity of postmodernism now and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's tainted with neo Marxism and that</v>

1557
01:08:43.951 --> 01:08:46.500
<v Speaker 4>should have been laid to rest a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1558
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.980
<v Speaker 4>We're driving because that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just.</v>

1559
01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:55.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason that the DMO postmodernist </v>

1560
01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.740
<v Speaker 4>can't let go of neo Marxism is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no impetus forward in </v>

1561
01:08:57.870 --> 01:09:00.090
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fundamental flaw.</v>

1562
01:09:00.091 --> 01:09:00.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1563
01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:02.130
<v Speaker 4>there's no grand narrative.</v>

1564
01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:02.900
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1565
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:04.620
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1566
01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't know because everything's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same as everything else.</v>

1567
01:09:07.051 --> 01:09:07.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1568
01:09:07.501 --> 01:09:09.390
<v Speaker 4>you can't live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't live that way.</v>

1569
01:09:09.391 --> 01:09:14.391
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to live that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While I will just sneak some Marxism in </v>

1570
01:09:14.391 --> 01:09:14.391
<v Speaker 4>the back door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1571
01:09:14.391 --> 01:09:14.391
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

1572
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 4>That's prime a fascia evidence in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>estimation that your philosophy is </v>

1573
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:24.230
<v Speaker 4>pragmatically lacking even though you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can make a perfectly coherent case for </v>

1574
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:24.360
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can't live it out.</v>

1575
01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.480
<v Speaker 4>You just can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to sneak in this </v>

1576
01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:29.480
<v Speaker 4>pathological Marxism in the back door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1577
01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:34.460
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just invalidates your entire </v>

1578
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:34.460
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But apart from all that,</v>

1579
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:39.140
<v Speaker 4>I think the postmodern objection to </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning is actually wrong.</v>

1580
01:09:39.451 --> 01:09:44.451
<v Speaker 4>While we talked about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do believe that there is a </v>

1581
01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:45.990
<v Speaker 4>transcendent ethic and I do believe that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it touches on the metaphysical.</v>

1582
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:50.990
<v Speaker 4>I believe if people experienced that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because people are perfectly capable of </v>

1583
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:54.771
<v Speaker 4>having unalterably profound religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences and the naturalistic </v>

1584
01:09:55.141 --> 01:09:57.030
<v Speaker 4>materialists don't know what the hell to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do with that,</v>

1585
01:09:57.090 --> 01:09:59.160
<v Speaker 4>they have no idea what to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact.</v>

1586
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1587
01:09:59.731 --> 01:10:00.810
<v Speaker 4>it's delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1588
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:01.770
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hang on a sec.</v>

1589
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:05.610
<v Speaker 4>People who have those experiences appear</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be more successful and healthier,</v>

1590
01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.160
<v Speaker 4>so when exactly in what manner is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>delusional and if you induce it in the </v>

1591
01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:11.760
<v Speaker 4>lab with Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1592
01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:15.600
<v Speaker 4>among people who are dying of cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their fear of death goes away.</v>

1593
01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:20.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's you're going to just </v>
<v Speaker 4>lay of the lay that out there as </v>

1594
01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.991
<v Speaker 4>delusional or you quit smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 five percent success rate with one </v>

1595
01:10:23.991 --> 01:10:27.771
<v Speaker 4>mystical experience on psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces 85 percent cessation rate and </v>

1596
01:10:27.771 --> 01:10:31.590
<v Speaker 4>smoking completely and with MDM,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a ecstasy.</v>

1597
01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.160
<v Speaker 4>The three treatments with Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the current research </v>

1598
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.521
<v Speaker 4>indicates produces a 72 percent cure </v>
<v Speaker 4>rate for intractable posttraumatic </v>

1599
01:10:42.031 --> 01:10:42.900
<v Speaker 4>stress disorder.</v>

1600
01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like those are miracle cures and no</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1601
01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.790
<v Speaker 4>and they have to be accompanied by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mystical experience.</v>

1602
01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:51.190
<v Speaker 4>No one knows how to account for that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there was a transfer,</v>

1603
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:54.410
<v Speaker 4>so it's a very physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean in a case like that,</v>

1604
01:10:54.411 --> 01:10:56.490
<v Speaker 4>you talked about Iowa or any of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1605
01:10:56.491 --> 01:10:58.710
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're eating something,</v>

1606
01:10:58.711 --> 01:10:59.970
<v Speaker 4>you're ingesting something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking it,</v>

1607
01:10:59.971 --> 01:11:01.920
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's physical.</v>

1608
01:11:01.921 --> 01:11:06.921
<v Speaker 4>It's here and now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the experience is metaphysical is </v>

1609
01:11:06.921 --> 01:11:09.870
<v Speaker 4>metaphase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a place where the biological and </v>

1610
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.870
<v Speaker 4>the transcendent touch and we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what to make of that.</v>

1611
01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:15.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why psychedelics through our </v>

1612
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.050
<v Speaker 4>whole culture into such a such a</v>

1613
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 5>flip this upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one knew what to do with them.</v>

1614
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.360
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Indians regarded psilocybin </v>

1615
01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.430
<v Speaker 5>as food of the gods for a reason and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when people have encountered psychedelic</v>

1616
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:28.431
<v Speaker 5>substances throughout human history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's always how they've been </v>

1617
01:11:28.431 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 5>characterized as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right food of the gods.</v>

1618
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:34.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like beware of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there they opened the door to the </v>

1619
01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:37.701
<v Speaker 5>transcendent and well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the evidence that they are doing</v>

1620
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:43.311
<v Speaker 5>something that psychedelic substances </v>
<v Speaker 5>are doing something that we seriously </v>

1621
01:11:43.311 --> 01:11:45.300
<v Speaker 5>don't understand at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not a bit is overwhelming.</v>

1622
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:50.420
<v Speaker 5>Rick strassman wrote a book on his </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences giving Dmt to a whole bunch </v>

1623
01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 5>of people down in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was at in Austin,</v>

1624
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:56.370
<v Speaker 5>I think strassman's a pretty straight </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists,</v>

1625
01:11:56.371 --> 01:12:01.371
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was interested in measuring </v>

1626
01:12:01.371 --> 01:12:01.371
<v Speaker 5>psychophysiological responses to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>

1627
01:12:01.371 --> 01:12:04.911
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd give people dmt and they all came </v>

1628
01:12:04.911 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 5>back with the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was blasted out of my consciousness.</v>

1629
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.550
<v Speaker 5>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I met a whole bunch of alien beings.</v>

1630
01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:12.870
<v Speaker 5>They were really surprised I was there </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I came back and it was the most</v>

1631
01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 5>real thing that's ever happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And straussman would say,</v>

1632
01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1633
01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:21.261
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had a Yogi and archetipal </v>

1634
01:12:21.261 --> 01:12:21.261
<v Speaker 5>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or it was a dream and they'd say,</v>

1635
01:12:21.261 --> 01:12:25.220
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then he got so distraught because of </v>

1636
01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:30.231
<v Speaker 5>these continual reports that he had </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped doing the research and like I'm </v>

1637
01:12:30.231 --> 01:12:31.980
<v Speaker 5>not making a claim for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for anything metaphysical here,</v>

1638
01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:36.981
<v Speaker 5>but I'm definitely pointing out that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are undeniable realms of human </v>

1639
01:12:37.651 --> 01:12:42.651
<v Speaker 5>experience that involve religious </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience and a sense of the infinite </v>

1640
01:12:44.491 --> 01:12:49.491
<v Speaker 5>transcendent that looked like they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy and that you cannot deny well.</v>

1641
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:51.990
<v Speaker 5>So what are you supposed to do with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

1642
01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.600
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you sold a box and you say,</v>

1643
01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:55.860
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to pay attention to.</v>

1644
01:12:55.861 --> 01:12:56.970
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not gonna work.</v>

1645
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to work.</v>

1646
01:12:58.001 --> 01:13:03.001
<v Speaker 1>And I've done a lot of those things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just mentioned and virtually always </v>

1647
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:04.360
<v Speaker 1>had good experiences on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is someone that I'm pretty sure he's</v>

1648
01:13:04.361 --> 01:13:07.280
<v Speaker 1>never smoked weed mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't?</v>

1649
01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't done Mtma and all that stuff</v>

1650
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:11.450
<v Speaker 1>will take a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1651
01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've done all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really do.</v>

1652
01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I smoked some weed but I don't.</v>

1653
01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done ecstasy and years and </v>

1654
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:22.410
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did do about a year ago and I had a </v>

1655
01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:22.570
<v Speaker 1>great day and I kind of wandered around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I,</v>

1656
01:13:22.571 --> 01:13:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt some,</v>

1657
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:25.210
<v Speaker 1>some things happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

1658
01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 1>When I did them in college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a couple of those type of </v>

1659
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 1>transcendent feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just part of something,</v>

1660
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1661
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:35.370
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear all this as someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't partake in any of this </v>

1662
01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:37.210
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of that?</v>

1663
01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.240
<v Speaker 1>That people can perhaps use some </v>
<v Speaker 1>substances that you're not down with on </v>

1664
01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:47.251
<v Speaker 1>a personal level to get to a place that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you actually think is a good </v>

1665
01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:47.251
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1666
01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the answer is that it depends on</v>

1667
01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:53.650
<v Speaker 3>the level of expertise of the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>using it is what I would suggest,</v>

1668
01:13:53.651 --> 01:13:54.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea,</v>

1669
01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:56.230
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not against prescription </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>

1670
01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:57.850
<v Speaker 3>So if you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1671
01:13:57.851 --> 01:14:00.160
<v Speaker 3>an actual program that is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>better somebody's life,</v>

1672
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.960
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it's somebody who's just,</v>

1673
01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I want to have a religious experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>than perhaps in Lsd.</v>

1674
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.660
<v Speaker 3>And then there's some serious downsides </v>
<v Speaker 3>to drugs that I,</v>

1675
01:14:07.661 --> 01:14:10.210
<v Speaker 3>I do wonder if it is necessary it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1676
01:14:10.211 --> 01:14:11.500
<v Speaker 3>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

1677
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

1678
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.640
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1679
01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.700
<v Speaker 4>in Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I keep reverting back to this </v>

1680
01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:17.700
<v Speaker 4>because I know it's the religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1681
01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:17.700
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there,</v>

1682
01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 4>there's two kinds of schools of thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>with regard to Judaism.</v>

1683
01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:21.220
<v Speaker 4>One are called the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1684
01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:22.780
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Ms Dot [inaudible].</v>

1685
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:26.080
<v Speaker 4>These are people who are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment mentality,</v>

1686
01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.760
<v Speaker 4>hard science folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the Hasidim not considered murder.</v>

1687
01:14:28.761 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 4>The people he see really Kabod,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the,</v>

1688
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:31.930
<v Speaker 4>the big beards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of the past,</v>

1689
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:32.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

1690
01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:34.750
<v Speaker 4>and they like to dance and they drink </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1691
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:36.050
<v Speaker 4>on Purim and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all this and that.</v>

1692
01:14:36.051 --> 01:14:41.051
<v Speaker 4>They're wonderful people and they a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great outreach specifically because </v>

1693
01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:41.320
<v Speaker 4>they're so spiritual and I tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>more of this noggin than a,</v>

1694
01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:42.400
<v Speaker 4>than a faucet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning that,</v>

1695
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:43.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1696
01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:43.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1697
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:45.730
<v Speaker 4>I try to get to dance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1698
01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.590
<v Speaker 4>it's nice operating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1699
01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:49.010
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1700
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:54.330
<v Speaker 4>I try to get to spirituality through </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason as opposed to through experience </v>

1701
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.390
<v Speaker 4>simply because I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1702
01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:01.510
<v Speaker 4>I know people who've had religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and it's really changed them.</v>

1703
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:06.870
<v Speaker 4>I think there are also a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have religious experience and it lasts </v>

1704
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:09.451
<v Speaker 4>for a given amount of time and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're done with the religious </v>

1705
01:15:09.451 --> 01:15:09.451
<v Speaker 4>experience and they just go back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing whatever they're doing.</v>

1706
01:15:09.451 --> 01:15:13.741
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is what you were doing in </v>

1707
01:15:13.741 --> 01:15:14.731
<v Speaker 4>college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that if you're looking for </v>

1708
01:15:14.731 --> 01:15:15.940
<v Speaker 4>that as a gateway out of whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is troubling you in terms of a lack</v>

1709
01:15:15.941 --> 01:15:17.980
<v Speaker 4>of purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a permanent solution,</v>

1710
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.020
<v Speaker 4>maybe that works for a small number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1711
01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:20.550
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1712
01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:25.740
<v Speaker 4>I highly doubt that most people can find</v>
<v Speaker 4>a level of purpose necessary to drive </v>

1713
01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:29.671
<v Speaker 4>the entirety of the rest of their lives </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of a framework of conscious </v>

1714
01:15:29.671 --> 01:15:33.061
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving them in the direction of doing </v>

1715
01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:33.061
<v Speaker 4>the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You told people,</v>

1716
01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:37.141
<v Speaker 4>he talked about Mescalin and Lsd in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>context of Huxley's introduction of </v>

1717
01:15:37.141 --> 01:15:38.140
<v Speaker 4>those substances into the Western world.</v>

1718
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 4>And he said two things in is inimitably </v>
<v Speaker 4>wise manner.</v>

1719
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.770
<v Speaker 4>The first thing he said is beware of </v>
<v Speaker 4>unearned wisdom,</v>

1720
01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.440
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1721
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:47.990
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he also said you,</v>

1722
01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:53.220
<v Speaker 4>you have to be very careful about about </v>
<v Speaker 4>entering the realm of the gods because </v>

1723
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:58.350
<v Speaker 4>you end up with a responsibility that </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be more crushing than you can </v>

1724
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.840
<v Speaker 4>tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's the same kind of idea.</v>

1725
01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:03.841
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never read anyone who wrote wiser </v>

1726
01:16:03.841 --> 01:16:05.440
<v Speaker 4>words about the dangers of psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>use than that because he didn't say,</v>

1727
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:07.030
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of this is real.</v>

1728
01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 4>He said it's more real than you want it </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

1729
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:13.150
<v Speaker 4>And so watch the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's extremely good advice</v>

1730
01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:18.151
<v Speaker 4>and it is very difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrate those experiences into their </v>

1731
01:16:18.151 --> 01:16:21.361
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although my experience with people has </v>

1732
01:16:21.361 --> 01:16:21.361
<v Speaker 4>been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've seen this with lots of people,</v>

1733
01:16:21.361 --> 01:16:22.060
<v Speaker 4>they've said that they've done </v>
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms,</v>

1734
01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:24.250
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to mystical experience and that that</v>

1735
01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.520
<v Speaker 4>provided them with a moral compass that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they lacked before.</v>

1736
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.580
<v Speaker 4>That never went away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've talked to many people who've </v>

1737
01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:32.880
<v Speaker 4>had that experience so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1738
01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:37.890
<v Speaker 4>I've also been in Amsterdam watching the</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 year old punk rockers and beer and go</v>

1739
01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:44.821
<v Speaker 4>pound out some street kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was the downside of transcendence </v>

1740
01:16:44.821 --> 01:16:49.381
<v Speaker 4>is something that's not to be trifled </v>
<v Speaker 4>with and there's also the opportunity </v>

1741
01:16:49.381 --> 01:16:52.921
<v Speaker 4>not to go to heaven but to go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that does happen to people and that </v>

1742
01:16:52.921 --> 01:16:56.971
<v Speaker 4>can be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that can induce posttraumatic stress </v>

1743
01:16:56.971 --> 01:16:56.971
<v Speaker 4>disorder essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1744
01:16:56.971 --> 01:16:57.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be aware of,</v>

1745
01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:02.160
<v Speaker 4>be aware of wandering and realms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not competent to wander,</v>

1746
01:17:02.161 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 4>rather they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1747
01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.090
<v Speaker 4>that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my central take.</v>

1748
01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:05.590
<v Speaker 4>And then I think it's really good for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1749
01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:08.640
<v Speaker 4>Like I think that what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>really works because you know,</v>

1750
01:17:08.641 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do Kinda what I</v>

1751
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.760
<v Speaker 2>did with a biblical lectures except you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it to an even greater extreme.</v>

1752
01:17:13.761 --> 01:17:16.310
<v Speaker 2>I would say you're so rational in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>

1753
01:17:16.311 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 2>like people know that you ever religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>over view,</v>

1754
01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't use that.</v>

1755
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 2>You use it less than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

1756
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:28.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it really works well for </v>

1757
01:17:28.061 --> 01:17:28.061
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very.</v>

1758
01:17:28.061 --> 01:17:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it's hard to for his faith on </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and I don't think it's wrong to </v>

1759
01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:31.980
<v Speaker 3>force faith on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you want also counterproductive.</v>

1760
01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1761
01:17:33.091 --> 01:17:35.430
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not preaching that you have to agree</v>

1762
01:17:35.431 --> 01:17:40.431
<v Speaker 3>with how I got to these values to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that these values are necessary for the </v>

1763
01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:44.571
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is essentially what I said to </v>

1764
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:44.571
<v Speaker 3>Sam when I was debating him is his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1765
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:44.880
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1766
01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:46.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of religious people.</v>

1767
01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.200
<v Speaker 3>He sort of suggested that I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>atheists can be moral people.</v>

1768
01:17:49.201 --> 01:17:51.210
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that's true at all.</v>

1769
01:17:51.211 --> 01:17:56.211
<v Speaker 3>I mean the point that I'm making is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to get to these valleys to have a </v>

1770
01:17:56.211 --> 01:17:56.211
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you get to those values,</v>

1771
01:17:56.370 --> 01:17:57.510
<v Speaker 3>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1772
01:17:57.511 --> 01:18:02.511
<v Speaker 3>I think requires a leap of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can make that leap of faith a </v>

1773
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:02.511
<v Speaker 3>variety of different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to end up needing these</v>

1774
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.430
<v Speaker 3>central values at road if you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>build a civilization off of that,</v>

1775
01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.720
<v Speaker 3>so whether you do that through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1776
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:12.730
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of method that the team wants </v>

1777
01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:12.730
<v Speaker 3>to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was weird is it,</v>

1778
01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:12.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam and I come from completely different</v>

1779
01:18:12.811 --> 01:18:17.811
<v Speaker 3>perspectives on virtually everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we share probably 90 to 95 percent </v>

1780
01:18:17.811 --> 01:18:21.081
<v Speaker 3>of our values and so what I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggesting is that those values are </v>

1781
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 3>rooted in a Judeo Christian civilization</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is mixed with a Greek civilization </v>

1782
01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:28.970
<v Speaker 3>that brought us to the same place </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we grew up five miles from each </v>

1783
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.970
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So of course we have the same values,</v>

1784
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1785
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was counter argument to that.</v>

1786
01:18:29.251 --> 01:18:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Basically would be that you're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about enlightenment values,</v>

1787
01:18:32.251 --> 01:18:35.350
<v Speaker 2>but you would say those values </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately came to.</v>

1788
01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.300
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing about that is that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a silly argument that those are</v>

1789
01:18:39.301 --> 01:18:44.301
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you guys will talk about when </v>

1790
01:18:44.301 --> 01:18:46.170
<v Speaker 2>you're on stage together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Biologists have already made short </v>

1791
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:48.441
<v Speaker 2>shrift of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Sam can't be an evolutionary </v>

1792
01:18:48.441 --> 01:18:51.000
<v Speaker 2>biologist and say that the values that </v>
<v Speaker 2>run Western civilization sprang from the</v>

1793
01:18:51.001 --> 01:18:56.001
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't get to have those </v>

1794
01:18:56.001 --> 01:18:56.001
<v Speaker 2>two timeframes at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may have slightly so putting words out</v>

1795
01:18:56.001 --> 01:19:00.271
<v Speaker 2>there and can see that I disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you a little bit about the atheist issue</v>

1796
01:19:00.541 --> 01:19:05.541
<v Speaker 2>because I think this is the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you think about the layers </v>

1797
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:07.140
<v Speaker 2>of the mind with the iceberg analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1798
01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got your,</v>

1799
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.740
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1800
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:14.750
<v Speaker 2>your patterns of action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you've got your justification </v>

1801
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.880
<v Speaker 2>for those patterns of actually might </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that those are rational,</v>

1802
01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.160
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's something underneath </v>

1803
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.251
<v Speaker 2>that which is like the images that </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent reality and the stories that </v>

1804
01:19:22.251 --> 01:19:26.361
<v Speaker 2>represent reality and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something underneath that even and I </v>

1805
01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:29.631
<v Speaker 2>think that to be religious is to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things in order </v>

1806
01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:33.051
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously and I don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have an ethic that's only </v>

1807
01:19:33.051 --> 01:19:37.371
<v Speaker 2>grounded in rationality because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the integrity of that rationality </v>

1808
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:41.130
<v Speaker 2>depends on the type of stories that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand that that exists.</v>

1809
01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.360
<v Speaker 3>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me rephrase that.</v>

1810
01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:47.361
<v Speaker 3>I actually agree with everything you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just said when I say that we have to </v>

1811
01:19:47.361 --> 01:19:47.361
<v Speaker 3>ground these values in order for us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build a civilization.</v>

1812
01:19:47.361 --> 01:19:49.590
<v Speaker 3>How you get there as your own business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean on an individual level,</v>

1813
01:19:49.591 --> 01:19:54.591
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that every way you get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>those values as equally valid or </v>

1814
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:55.950
<v Speaker 3>otherwise it Sam and I would agree like </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1815
01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:00.980
<v Speaker 3>I do not think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mode of thinking from evolutionary </v>

1816
01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:01.710
<v Speaker 3>biology to the values that I think are </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary for building a civilization.</v>

1817
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Even if I see weaknesses coming up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam's representations for this reasons,</v>

1818
01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>the first thing is he has to</v>

1819
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:11.970
<v Speaker 4>dispense with consciousness and he has </v>
<v Speaker 4>to dispense with freewill and I actually</v>

1820
01:20:11.971 --> 01:20:16.971
<v Speaker 4>think that's deeply problematic and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think the reason he has to do that and </v>

1821
01:20:16.971 --> 01:20:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Dennett does it too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is because there is something </v>

1822
01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:22.551
<v Speaker 4>metaphysically strange about </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and you can't allow for </v>

1823
01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.310
<v Speaker 4>that if you're a reductionist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>materialist.</v>

1824
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.140
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm more than willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1825
01:20:25.141 --> 01:20:28.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand consciousness at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the more I think about it,</v>

1826
01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:33.921
<v Speaker 4>the less I understand it because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to be the linchpin of being </v>

1827
01:20:33.921 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 4>without consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no being we could say,</v>

1828
01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:38.100
<v Speaker 4>well the material reality continues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1829
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:43.460
<v Speaker 4>well maybe and maybe not because we do </v>
<v Speaker 4>not understand the relationship between </v>

1830
01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.910
<v Speaker 4>time and space and consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's no,</v>

1831
01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:47.640
<v Speaker 4>it's not self evident that what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying is true.</v>

1832
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:49.920
<v Speaker 4>It might be true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even if it was true,</v>

1833
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:51.810
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1834
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:55.800
<v Speaker 4>How does the universe that has no </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious ness in it exist?</v>

1835
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:58.950
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you parameterize it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it have a duration?</v>

1836
01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:01.770
<v Speaker 4>Does it have a size?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it have any qualities?</v>

1837
01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Like what is like a video game that no </v>
<v Speaker 4>one's playing,</v>

1838
01:21:04.921 --> 01:21:05.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1839
01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.080
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that exactly?</v>

1840
01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Well that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where we get to,</v>

1841
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:13.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to that three hour conversation </v>

1842
01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 4>that you and Sam had as to the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 4>truth and what exactly truth is.</v>

1843
01:21:13.831 --> 01:21:15.160
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I always </v>
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>

1844
01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1845
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:18.450
<v Speaker 4>Critique Sam's ideology without him here</v>
<v Speaker 4>to defend himself.</v>

1846
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.580
<v Speaker 4>Although it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely fun,</v>

1847
01:21:20.581 --> 01:21:22.470
<v Speaker 4>but we'll have to have been here to </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually actually do that.</v>

1848
01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things that I've always </v>

1849
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.991
<v Speaker 4>found weird is that he and I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>precisely the same notion of an </v>

1850
01:21:29.991 --> 01:21:32.391
<v Speaker 4>objective truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't understand where he's </v>

1851
01:21:32.391 --> 01:21:33.270
<v Speaker 4>getting his from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning like I'm getting,</v>

1852
01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:34.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't either like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1853
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:35.490
<v Speaker 4>and he also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if he,</v>

1854
01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:35.860
<v Speaker 4>if he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he,</v>

1855
01:21:35.861 --> 01:21:40.861
<v Speaker 4>if you base your viewpoint on in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>materialist evolutionary biology than </v>

1856
01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:44.451
<v Speaker 4>what you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>w what you would say is the truth is </v>

1857
01:21:44.451 --> 01:21:44.451
<v Speaker 4>that which is most biologically </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>

1858
01:21:44.451 --> 01:21:44.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1859
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:46.770
<v Speaker 4>That's the claim I was making when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked to Sam.</v>

1860
01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:47.280
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1861
01:21:47.281 --> 01:21:52.281
<v Speaker 4>Which is which is your claim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also a claim that leads to religion </v>

1862
01:21:52.281 --> 01:21:54.861
<v Speaker 4>because biologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious believers are more </v>

1863
01:21:54.861 --> 01:21:54.861
<v Speaker 4>biologically successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The nonreligious believers,</v>

1864
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:57.600
<v Speaker 4>all history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious belief evolved,</v>

1865
01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

1866
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.340
<v Speaker 4>Not only did religious belief evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly it evolved.</v>

1867
01:22:02.341 --> 01:22:07.341
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the human universals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The capacity for religious experience </v>

1868
01:22:07.341 --> 01:22:08.280
<v Speaker 4>evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you might say,</v>

1869
01:22:08.281 --> 01:22:09.350
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe you could.</v>

1870
01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:14.400
<v Speaker 4>You could take the viewpoint that seems </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be characteristic of Steven pinker </v>

1871
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:14.400
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1872
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.351
<v Speaker 4>it's a spandrel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a side effect of something </v>

1873
01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.601
<v Speaker 4>more substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In my objection to that is define your </v>

1874
01:22:20.601 --> 01:22:22.730
<v Speaker 4>spandrel first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1875
01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:27.890
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to eat right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to define a way the side </v>

1876
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:27.890
<v Speaker 4>effects of the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1877
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:28.470
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly it.</v>

1878
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people talk about drugs,</v>

1879
01:22:31.801 --> 01:22:33.150
<v Speaker 4>very often what they'll do is they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1880
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:33.600
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1881
01:22:33.601 --> 01:22:38.601
<v Speaker 4>the drug is for a headache,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has the side effect of causing </v>

1882
01:22:38.601 --> 01:22:38.601
<v Speaker 4>your cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1883
01:22:38.601 --> 01:22:38.601
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1884
01:22:38.601 --> 01:22:38.601
<v Speaker 4>the drug causes cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1885
01:22:38.601 --> 01:22:43.420
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting rid of the headache is </v>

1886
01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:43.420
<v Speaker 1>the side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1887
01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:43.930
<v Speaker 1>every one of those prescription </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials,</v>

1888
01:22:43.931 --> 01:22:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>headache,</v>

1889
01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:45.400
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nausea,</v>

1890
01:22:45.401 --> 01:22:46.590
<v Speaker 1>thoughts of suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

1891
01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:47.650
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your cough,</v>

1892
01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1893
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:49.410
<v Speaker 1>it's really nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1894
01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:51.890
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to be very respectful of,</v>

1895
01:22:51.891 --> 01:22:56.891
<v Speaker 1>of both of your times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yours particularly because you're </v>

1896
01:22:56.891 --> 01:22:56.891
<v Speaker 1>doing like a two hour lecture tended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the orpheum.</v>

1897
01:22:56.891 --> 01:22:58.960
<v Speaker 1>There might be a surprise guest there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say who,</v>

1898
01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:04.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna do a half hour more if </v>

1899
01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.091
<v Speaker 1>you guys can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do a q and a from the </v>

1900
01:23:06.091 --> 01:23:09.091
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do want to ask guys one other </v>

1901
01:23:09.091 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>thing first and I just want to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get this to truly be as as personal as I</v>

1902
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:14.761
<v Speaker 1>can get out of you guys in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of thousands of people as </v>

1903
01:23:14.761 --> 01:23:19.080
<v Speaker 1>these last couple of years it happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you both raising profile and </v>

1904
01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.991
<v Speaker 1>you're out there saying what you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and defending your beliefs </v>

1905
01:23:21.991 --> 01:23:25.351
<v Speaker 1>and being friends with people like Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you disagree with on different </v>

1906
01:23:25.351 --> 01:23:25.650
<v Speaker 1>things and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1907
01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.840
<v Speaker 1>what sort of been the most personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you've kind of struggled with</v>

1908
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.160
<v Speaker 1>along the way?</v>

1909
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.350
<v Speaker 5>I want to go deep before we open it up </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the audience.</v>

1910
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.390
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me it's two things.</v>

1911
01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:39.840
<v Speaker 5>One is for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not so bad now.</v>

1912
01:23:39.841 --> 01:23:44.841
<v Speaker 5>It's still pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I've lived in constant existential </v>

1913
01:23:44.841 --> 01:23:48.711
<v Speaker 5>terror of saying something that will be </v>
<v Speaker 5>fatal because I've been in this </v>

1914
01:23:48.841 --> 01:23:52.250
<v Speaker 5>situation for 15 months where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1915
01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:57.620
<v Speaker 5>and there's been a few things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>done or said that have people have </v>

1916
01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:00.180
<v Speaker 5>argued skirted the edges and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 5>they did.</v>

1917
01:24:00.181 --> 01:24:01.940
<v Speaker 5>Because if you say 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

1918
01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:04.830
<v Speaker 5>something's going to skirt the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've been,</v>

1919
01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:09.980
<v Speaker 5>I've had to watch myself in an intensely</v>
<v Speaker 5>hypervigilant manner to ensure that I </v>

1920
01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:12.030
<v Speaker 5>don't provide those who would like to</v>

1921
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:18.410
<v Speaker 5>provide those who regard me as their </v>
<v Speaker 5>enemy with the tools to dispense with me</v>

1922
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:23.770
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have my family resting on me as well </v>

1923
01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:23.770
<v Speaker 5>as well as whatever else I happened to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be doing.</v>

1924
01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 5>So that's been extraordinarily intense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing is,</v>

1925
01:24:26.411 --> 01:24:31.411
<v Speaker 5>is persistent feeling of surreal </v>
<v Speaker 5>seriality that see one of this,</v>

1926
01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.880
<v Speaker 5>one of the markers of posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 5>stress disorder is that you can't </v>

1927
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.280
<v Speaker 5>believe that what's happening to you is </v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

1928
01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 5>It's like I felt that for literally I </v>
<v Speaker 5>felt that way every single day since </v>

1929
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.421
<v Speaker 5>September of 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I just cannot get accustomed to.</v>

1930
01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even just to the scandals that I've been</v>

1931
01:24:49.731 --> 01:24:52.130
<v Speaker 5>involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just one scandal after another,</v>

1932
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:53.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

1933
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.680
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1934
01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a frame of reference within</v>
<v Speaker 5>which to put this.</v>

1935
01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I'll just briefly say for </v>

1936
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1937
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1938
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.821
<v Speaker 1>We're all afraid of the one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to accidentally just </v>

1939
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:07.640
<v Speaker 1>misspeak or say something right out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

1940
01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:08.870
<v Speaker 1>You wave a meeting,</v>

1941
01:25:10.810 --> 01:25:14.410
<v Speaker 5>something stupid defending yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 5>which you could certainly do.</v>

1942
01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:14.600
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1943
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:16.580
<v Speaker 1>He had been writing columns since I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

1944
01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:23.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's one line with you that </v>

1945
01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:23.140
<v Speaker 1>you wanted one tweet that you sent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you regret now and it's like,</v>

1946
01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to read the tweet in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual tweet thread.</v>

1947
01:25:25.131 --> 01:25:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I explained exactly what I meant in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>

1948
01:25:26.601 --> 01:25:31.601
<v Speaker 1>but nobody ever reads the next tweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>that literally explains what I meant in </v>

1949
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:34.841
<v Speaker 1>that tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even have to mention which </v>

1950
01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:34.841
<v Speaker 1>tweet to just add more fuel to the fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>button,</v>

1951
01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:35.150
<v Speaker 1>but very quickly because I do want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the,</v>

1952
01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:36.980
<v Speaker 1>to the audience questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for me,</v>

1953
01:25:36.981 --> 01:25:41.981
<v Speaker 1>the second one is the one that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggled with it this surreal one </v>

1954
01:25:41.981 --> 01:25:43.550
<v Speaker 1>that's sometimes I'll look and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are saying about Dave Rubin and I</v>

1955
01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.050
<v Speaker 1>and then I for a moment I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1956
01:25:45.051 --> 01:25:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dave Rubin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any of them.</v>

1957
01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Even if I do think even if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something they're nice saying about me,</v>

1958
01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1959
01:25:52.331 --> 01:25:55.280
<v Speaker 1>that to me and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also just the other part of,</v>

1960
01:25:55.281 --> 01:25:55.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1961
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:59.750
<v Speaker 1>we sort of live close to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll proximity and I'll go out and,</v>

1962
01:25:59.751 --> 01:26:04.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Petco will say something nice to me </v>

1963
01:26:04.751 --> 01:26:04.880
<v Speaker 1>and then for some reason they always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like Ben more but they look great.</v>

1964
01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.530
<v Speaker 1>But like I go out and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1965
01:26:06.531 --> 01:26:09.000
<v Speaker 1>like the things that I'm doing has </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to people.</v>

1966
01:26:09.001 --> 01:26:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of built in pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least for me,</v>

1967
01:26:11.871 --> 01:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1968
01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:19.520
<v Speaker 5>Well I feel that too because now </v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever I go somewhere people come up </v>

1969
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.110
<v Speaker 5>and they almost always say the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1970
01:26:20.111 --> 01:26:21.640
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1971
01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.880
<v Speaker 5>I was in a pretty dark place and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>been listening to your lectures and </v>

1972
01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:26.880
<v Speaker 5>they've really helped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks a lot.</v>

1973
01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.730
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1974
01:26:27.731 --> 01:26:29.180
<v Speaker 5>if you could have your wish and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could,</v>

1975
01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.190
<v Speaker 5>what strangers would say to you on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>street?</v>

1976
01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.520
<v Speaker 5>What a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No kidding.</v>

1977
01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:36.850
<v Speaker 5>But it's also kind of a terrifying thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>

1978
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:38.920
<v Speaker 5>people have pinned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1979
01:26:38.921 --> 01:26:40.720
<v Speaker 5>let's say they've pinned their hopes on </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I,</v>

1980
01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:43.030
<v Speaker 5>what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the right way to say it,</v>

1981
01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:48.240
<v Speaker 5>but in some sense that also means they </v>
<v Speaker 5>pinned their hopes on me and like I'm </v>

1982
01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.950
<v Speaker 5>not by any stretch of the imagination </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfect far from it.</v>

1983
01:26:50.951 --> 01:26:55.290
<v Speaker 5>And so I do live in constant terror of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sinking my ship in a,</v>

1984
01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:58.540
<v Speaker 5>in a know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a particularly awful manner.</v>

1985
01:26:58.541 --> 01:27:00.030
<v Speaker 5>I still think that's the most likely.</v>

1986
01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wake you up again.</v>

1987
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:04.880
<v Speaker 3>This where you just wake up and terror </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of the night that somebody</v>

1988
01:27:04.881 --> 01:27:07.370
<v Speaker 3>is going to take something that you said</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of context and you think,</v>

1989
01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.370
<v Speaker 3>did I really say it exactly the way I </v>
<v Speaker 3>meant to say it?</v>

1990
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:11.390
<v Speaker 3>That didn't mean that that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1991
01:27:11.391 --> 01:27:12.950
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a definite thing.</v>

1992
01:27:12.951 --> 01:27:17.951
<v Speaker 3>And then you and it that the upside is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people listen to what we're saying </v>

1993
01:27:17.951 --> 01:27:22.631
<v Speaker 3>and take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the downside is that people are </v>

1994
01:27:22.631 --> 01:27:22.631
<v Speaker 3>taking and taking it seriously.</v>

1995
01:27:22.631 --> 01:27:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So for you then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be something,</v>

1996
01:27:24.341 --> 01:27:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without getting too in the weeds,</v>

1997
01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:27.730
<v Speaker 1>like saying related to security or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

1998
01:27:27.731 --> 01:27:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1999
01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.710
<v Speaker 1>when you travel now you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with you.</v>

2000
01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:34.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous that I filed under </v>

2001
01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:35.370
<v Speaker 3>surreal because I actually have never </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought of myself as in serious physical</v>

2002
01:27:35.371 --> 01:27:40.371
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when people say you're serious </v>

2003
01:27:40.371 --> 01:27:40.371
<v Speaker 3>physical danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like this is America.</v>

2004
01:27:40.371 --> 01:27:43.941
<v Speaker 3>Am I really in fiscal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whenever I do these lectures and </v>

2005
01:27:43.941 --> 01:27:46.341
<v Speaker 3>I've got a security team of 10 people </v>
<v Speaker 3>around me when I tell myself maybe it </v>

2006
01:27:46.341 --> 01:27:47.910
<v Speaker 3>was me whistling past the graveyard is </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the safest guy in the room.</v>

2007
01:27:47.911 --> 01:27:49.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2008
01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:50.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2009
01:27:50.881 --> 01:27:55.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The confluence of politics now is so </v>

2010
01:27:55.881 --> 01:27:55.881
<v Speaker 3>odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2011
01:27:55.881 --> 01:27:56.730
<v Speaker 3>the last night during the state of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>union,</v>

2012
01:27:56.731 --> 01:28:01.731
<v Speaker 3>they introduced trump as the president </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the United States and I just find </v>

2013
01:28:01.731 --> 01:28:01.910
<v Speaker 3>myself laughing out loud because what in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is going on?</v>

2014
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:04.110
<v Speaker 3>Like I forget that I liked a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff he's doing,</v>

2015
01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:05.640
<v Speaker 3>like what in the world?</v>

2016
01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:07.530
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a,</v>

2017
01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I was reading a book about Brahms the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day and in this book about Brahms,</v>

2018
01:28:11.850 --> 01:28:13.880
<v Speaker 3>it talks about how he's hobnobbing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2019
01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 3>with various other composers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's friends with Jacques and he is </v>

2020
01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 3>fights with wagner and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>

2021
01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.760
<v Speaker 3>and he's walking in these circles and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

2022
01:28:20.761 --> 01:28:22.350
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that must have been a cool thing to walk</v>

2023
01:28:22.351 --> 01:28:27.351
<v Speaker 3>in these circles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I look around and I realized </v>

2024
01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:27.351
<v Speaker 3>that the people that I work with in 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

2025
01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:27.351
<v Speaker 3>this may be the people that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing about,</v>

2026
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is like.</v>

2027
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:33.470
<v Speaker 3>And that was the day that Shapiro got </v>
<v Speaker 3>together with Ruben and George Pearson </v>

2028
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:34.980
<v Speaker 3>and talked about deep issues of </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy and you realize,</v>

2029
01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:36.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did we end up in this position?</v>

2030
01:28:36.661 --> 01:28:41.661
<v Speaker 3>Like this is one of the issues of </v>
<v Speaker 3>existential terror I have is are we the </v>

2031
01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:45.681
<v Speaker 3>best that we have to offer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I look at all the people in the </v>

2032
01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.180
<v Speaker 3>White House for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know like half the people in the White</v>

2033
01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:51.570
<v Speaker 3>House and I think is this the pinnacle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like are like,</v>

2034
01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:53.320
<v Speaker 3>that's not a rip on the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>White House.</v>

2035
01:28:53.321 --> 01:28:56.130
<v Speaker 3>That's some grip on humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like is this the best that we can do?</v>

2036
01:28:56.670 --> 01:29:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Am I even close to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should I be in this position of </v>

2037
01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:04.161
<v Speaker 3>prominence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's got to be people smarter </v>

2038
01:29:04.161 --> 01:29:04.161
<v Speaker 3>than am I mean a lot</v>

2039
01:29:04.161 --> 01:29:07.130
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a beautiful thing I would hope </v>

2040
01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:07.130
<v Speaker 1>and I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked somebody this,</v>

2041
01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:07.920
<v Speaker 1>so this thought experiment the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

2042
01:29:07.921 --> 01:29:12.921
<v Speaker 1>which would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would you prefer to be the </v>

2043
01:29:12.921 --> 01:29:14.841
<v Speaker 1>smartest man in the DM civilization or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dumbest madness Martin civilization </v>

2044
01:29:14.841 --> 01:29:18.380
<v Speaker 1>and I think I can honestly say I prefer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the dumbest man in a smart </v>

2045
01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.781
<v Speaker 1>civilization and some sort of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>disquieting about being seen anyway as </v>

2046
01:29:20.781 --> 01:29:22.260
<v Speaker 1>one of the smart people and dumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

2047
01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2048
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 1>there are literally thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this live,</v>

2049
01:29:25.081 --> 01:29:30.081
<v Speaker 1>obviously in that election is over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next couple of months and hopefully </v>

2050
01:29:30.081 --> 01:29:32.751
<v Speaker 1>there will be some people that will come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with some better ideas than Ben </v>

2051
01:29:32.751 --> 01:29:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro and Jordan Olsen and Dave Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll find something else do.</v>

2052
01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:35.640
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what we're gonna we're gonna.</v>

2053
01:29:35.641 --> 01:29:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Take a quick little break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2054
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I know already they're giving me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>signal.</v>

2055
01:29:38.491 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 1>We have roughly 400 billion questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will do our best to be brief.</v>

2056
01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:45.640
<v Speaker 1>That's easy for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're known for.</v>

2057
01:29:45.650 --> 01:29:48.420
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known him for A.</v>

2058
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so give us just like a minute or two.</v>

2059
01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Hang tight right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2060
01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the questions in a moment.</v>

2061
01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Alright guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try to plow through as </v>

2062
01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:10.380
<v Speaker 1>many questions as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

2063
01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Jordan is at the orpheum theater here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown Los Angeles tonight.</v>

2064
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sold out already,</v>

2065
01:32:12.821 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be riots outside.</v>

2066
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have a ticket you will see </v>

2067
01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Jordan later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2068
01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:20.340
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2069
01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:23.691
<v Speaker 1>super chat for Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try to do these as </v>

2070
01:32:23.691 --> 01:32:26.041
<v Speaker 1>quickly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've recently taken your understand </v>

2071
01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:27.310
<v Speaker 1>myself personality test and scored very </v>
<v Speaker 1>low in all aspects of agreeableness.</v>

2072
01:32:27.490 --> 01:32:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I have the cognitive ability to emulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>these aspects and do so for the benefit </v>

2073
01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:36.271
<v Speaker 1>of putting my kids in community here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>emulation or enough or do I have to </v>

2074
01:32:36.271 --> 01:32:37.580
<v Speaker 1>actually take the steps in showing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly showing,</v>

2075
01:32:37.581 --> 01:32:37.660
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2076
01:32:37.710 --> 01:32:39.210
<v Speaker 5>Agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you fake it?</v>

2077
01:32:39.211 --> 01:32:40.760
<v Speaker 5>Basically?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

2078
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:43.890
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if emulation is motivated by a,</v>

2079
01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:49.100
<v Speaker 5>let's call it a noble aim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the understanding that reciprocity is </v>

2080
01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:52.521
<v Speaker 5>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is evidence showing that </v>

2081
01:32:52.521 --> 01:32:52.680
<v Speaker 5>disagreeable people do quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>better if they go out of their way to do</v>

2082
01:32:52.681 --> 01:32:54.870
<v Speaker 5>things for other people too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make that a practice.</v>

2083
01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.100
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is if,</v>

2084
01:32:56.490 --> 01:33:01.490
<v Speaker 5>if you're an introvert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to become a conscious </v>

2085
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.490
<v Speaker 5>extrovert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2086
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.680
<v Speaker 5>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>

2087
01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:02.630
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2088
01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:07.640
<v Speaker 5>and if you're disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to become consciously </v>

2089
01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:07.640
<v Speaker 5>agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can do it.</v>

2090
01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.520
<v Speaker 5>And emulation is the first step to </v>
<v Speaker 5>incorporating it,</v>

2091
01:33:08.521 --> 01:33:13.521
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you're doing it to manipulate </v>

2092
01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:13.521
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's okay.</v>

2093
01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Different story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2094
01:33:14.081 --> 01:33:19.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton of people here that </v>

2095
01:33:19.081 --> 01:33:19.081
<v Speaker 1>donated on super chat just to say hi and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

2096
01:33:19.081 --> 01:33:21.640
<v Speaker 1>So hello to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a quick one for band.</v>

2097
01:33:21.641 --> 01:33:26.641
<v Speaker 1>I think we've already hit this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any chance of a future discussion </v>

2098
01:33:26.641 --> 01:33:26.641
<v Speaker 1>with Milo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2099
01:33:26.641 --> 01:33:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

2100
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have something to say.</v>

2101
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an interesting one.</v>

2102
01:33:30.731 --> 01:33:35.731
<v Speaker 1>And Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the break mentioned that we </v>

2103
01:33:35.731 --> 01:33:35.731
<v Speaker 1>should be doing a show on the future at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point.</v>

2104
01:33:35.731 --> 01:33:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you think like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that abortion and artificial </v>

2105
01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:40.600
<v Speaker 1>intelligence will eliminate humanity as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know it?</v>

2106
01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching this new Philip k Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing on Hulu now,</v>

2107
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:44.080
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2108
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very into it.</v>

2109
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do it.</v>

2110
01:33:49.421 --> 01:33:50.720
<v Speaker 5>You're a Scifi guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can get it.</v>

2111
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:55.800
<v Speaker 5>We could talk about Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ai is going to transform what human </v>

2112
01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.031
<v Speaker 5>beings are dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have to decide in what </v>

2113
01:34:00.031 --> 01:34:03.001
<v Speaker 5>manner we want to be transformed and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>should bloody well hope and pray that </v>

2114
01:34:03.001 --> 01:34:05.500
<v Speaker 5>the people who are leading the </v>
<v Speaker 5>technological revolution are careful and</v>

2115
01:34:05.501 --> 01:34:07.000
<v Speaker 5>ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People just don't.</v>

2116
01:34:07.090 --> 01:34:08.050
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That ship sailed.</v>

2117
01:34:08.051 --> 01:34:13.051
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like we know already that that's </v>

2118
01:34:13.051 --> 01:34:13.051
<v Speaker 5>not how it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know there's so many problems related</v>

2119
01:34:13.051 --> 01:34:17.341
<v Speaker 5>to the diversity memo and the algorithms</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all that already from the tech </v>

2120
01:34:17.341 --> 01:34:17.830
<v Speaker 5>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people working on these.</v>

2121
01:34:18.090 --> 01:34:23.090
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be terrified of this </v>

2122
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.090
<v Speaker 5>transhumanism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2123
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.770
<v Speaker 5>what do we want to turn into?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need a vision of the future,</v>

2124
01:34:23.771 --> 01:34:25.570
<v Speaker 5>which is why we need to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>

2125
01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:29.140
<v Speaker 5>What am I think one of the things we </v>
<v Speaker 5>need to do collectively is to develop.</v>

2126
01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:30.250
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2127
01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.820
<v Speaker 5>I believe that the human race can do </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything it wants in the next 30 years.</v>

2128
01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.440
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gates was talking.</v>

2129
01:34:35.441 --> 01:34:37.960
<v Speaker 5>Bill Gates was talking the other day </v>
<v Speaker 5>about eradicating malaria.</v>

2130
01:34:38.150 --> 01:34:43.150
<v Speaker 5>He's really set on eradicating the five </v>
<v Speaker 5>major transmissible diseases that could </v>

2131
01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:46.570
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could eliminate most of our problems.</v>

2132
01:34:46.571 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2133
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:52.201
<v Speaker 5>we should concentrate on the future that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would like to have and try to bring </v>

2134
01:34:52.201 --> 01:34:55.291
<v Speaker 5>it into being and then maybe we can get </v>
<v Speaker 5>artificial intelligence to serve that </v>

2135
01:34:55.291 --> 01:34:59.430
<v Speaker 5>instead of serving whatever in Kuwait </v>
<v Speaker 5>and pathological set of principles that </v>

2136
01:34:59.601 --> 01:35:01.950
<v Speaker 5>it's serving now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we will suffer for it.</v>

2137
01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2138
01:35:02.651 --> 01:35:07.651
<v Speaker 1>let's cross our fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the likelihood that the sjw </v>

2139
01:35:07.651 --> 01:35:09.610
<v Speaker 1>postmodern left collapse will happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon?</v>

2140
01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Basically?</v>

2141
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's more likely than </v>

2142
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.430
<v Speaker 3>people think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it that way.</v>

2143
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:19.001
<v Speaker 3>I think that right now the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sjws think that they are on top and </v>

2144
01:35:19.001 --> 01:35:21.821
<v Speaker 3>they think that they are ascendant and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that the growing popularity of </v>

2145
01:35:21.821 --> 01:35:23.090
<v Speaker 3>people who are not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially among young people,</v>

2146
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:28.091
<v Speaker 3>I mean my entire audience is young </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like legitimately mind higher </v>

2147
01:35:28.091 --> 01:35:28.250
<v Speaker 3>audience is people who are under the age</v>
<v Speaker 3>of 40 and probably half.</v>

2148
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:33.390
<v Speaker 3>It's under the age of 25 and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably imagined since him for you </v>

2149
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.390
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2150
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>

2151
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:38.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole group of young people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are just looking at this stuff and </v>

2152
01:35:38.890 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 3>innately saying I'm bored with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing here.</v>

2153
01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.460
<v Speaker 3>And so I think there's a good shot that </v>
<v Speaker 3>did the identity politics is actually an</v>

2154
01:35:43.461 --> 01:35:44.270
<v Speaker 3>older person's game.</v>

2155
01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2156
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.880
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2157
01:35:45.881 --> 01:35:47.350
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're only gonna do two more.</v>

2158
01:35:47.410 --> 01:35:48.670
<v Speaker 1>What will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll categorize,</v>

2159
01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:51.700
<v Speaker 1>categorize all of these and maybe next </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you guys are on,</v>

2160
01:35:51.701 --> 01:35:52.290
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get,</v>

2161
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:54.090
<v Speaker 1>we'll hit some of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2162
01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:55.660
<v Speaker 1>but we'll do two more because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good.</v>

2163
01:35:55.661 --> 01:35:57.310
<v Speaker 1>They sort of hit right where we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2164
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you both can answer this,</v>

2165
01:35:59.021 --> 01:36:00.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's directed to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

2166
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:04.330
<v Speaker 1>any followup on your call earlier this </v>
<v Speaker 1>month for students to stand up and leave</v>

2167
01:36:04.331 --> 01:36:07.600
<v Speaker 1>the classroom whenever the teacher </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentions equity,</v>

2168
01:36:07.601 --> 01:36:12.601
<v Speaker 1>diversity and justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know this is something you've </v>

2169
01:36:12.601 --> 01:36:12.601
<v Speaker 1>talked about a bit about how you deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with</v>

2170
01:36:12.601 --> 01:36:14.560
<v Speaker 5>college professor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was for junior high and high school</v>

2171
01:36:14.561 --> 01:36:16.120
<v Speaker 5>kids to talk to their parents about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2172
01:36:16.121 --> 01:36:21.121
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to provide people with easy</v>
<v Speaker 5>markers to note that their children are </v>

2173
01:36:21.121 --> 01:36:21.760
<v Speaker 5>being indoctrinated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not educated,</v>

2174
01:36:21.761 --> 01:36:22.270
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2175
01:36:22.271 --> 01:36:24.580
<v Speaker 5>if they're talk about equity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>diversity,</v>

2176
01:36:24.581 --> 01:36:26.770
<v Speaker 5>inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>white privilege or gender,</v>

2177
01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:28.980
<v Speaker 5>it's time to leave the class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

2178
01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:32.230
<v Speaker 5>and now that didn't cause nearly as much</v>
<v Speaker 5>trouble that video is.</v>

2179
01:36:32.231 --> 01:36:37.231
<v Speaker 5>I thought it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a pretty dangerous idea to be </v>

2180
01:36:37.231 --> 01:36:37.231
<v Speaker 5>telling that to a 13,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14.</v>

2181
01:36:37.231 --> 01:36:39.340
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's also dangerous not to tell them</v>

2182
01:36:39.341 --> 01:36:44.341
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean it's particularly Germane in </v>

2183
01:36:44.341 --> 01:36:46.321
<v Speaker 5>Ontario where the elementary teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Federation of Ontario has explicitly </v>

2184
01:36:46.321 --> 01:36:49.720
<v Speaker 5>developed a social justice curriculum </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that name,</v>

2185
01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:54.810
<v Speaker 5>whose explicit purpose is to transform </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids from kindergarten to grade eight </v>

2186
01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:58.831
<v Speaker 5>into social justice activists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've even bent the selection of </v>

2187
01:36:58.831 --> 01:37:02.101
<v Speaker 5>literature to promote that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're perverting art for ideology </v>

2188
01:37:02.101 --> 01:37:04.020
<v Speaker 5>and that's the official policy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the elementary teachers,</v>

2189
01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.790
<v Speaker 5>Federation of Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they're going to do that,</v>

2190
01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:07.570
<v Speaker 5>play that game.</v>

2191
01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:08.770
<v Speaker 5>Then for me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2192
01:37:08.771 --> 01:37:13.771
<v Speaker 5>here's five phrases that that are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>decently diagnostic.</v>

2193
01:37:14.171 --> 01:37:17.860
<v Speaker 5>You can be pretty certain that if these </v>
<v Speaker 5>topics come up in your class that you're</v>

2194
01:37:17.861 --> 01:37:20.160
<v Speaker 5>now into indoctrination territory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2195
01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:23.320
<v Speaker 5>I think people should walk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the risk though of saying that to</v>

2196
01:37:23.321 --> 01:37:28.321
<v Speaker 5>a kid that may come home and the parents</v>
<v Speaker 5>may not even understand these issues </v>

2197
01:37:28.321 --> 01:37:28.330
<v Speaker 5>enough to defend risk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>risk everywhere,</v>

2198
01:37:28.331 --> 01:37:29.070
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2199
01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.120
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the risk of going along with it.</v>

2200
01:37:31.121 --> 01:37:33.580
<v Speaker 5>There's the risk of standing up against </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and I believe,</v>

2201
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:35.710
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I've been doing what I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>been doing,</v>

2202
01:37:35.711 --> 01:37:40.711
<v Speaker 5>is that I believe that the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 5>stating that this is dangerous and </v>

2203
01:37:40.711 --> 01:37:43.390
<v Speaker 5>should stop is way less than the risk of</v>
<v Speaker 5>going along with it.</v>

2204
01:37:44.050 --> 01:37:45.050
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is going to be.</v>

2205
01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:50.060
<v Speaker 1>This is gonna be the last one for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will pick this up at another point </v>

2206
01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:52.750
<v Speaker 1>and we also discussed during the break </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe we can do some kind of live </v>

2207
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:54.110
<v Speaker 1>thing together with this whole crew of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that we're talking about.</v>

2208
01:37:54.111 --> 01:37:55.950
<v Speaker 1>We'll see who we can get to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably in la,</v>

2209
01:37:55.951 --> 01:37:56.770
<v Speaker 1>but we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2210
01:37:56.970 --> 01:38:01.970
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I've asked you some form of </v>

2211
01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:01.970
<v Speaker 1>this in our other interviews before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's,</v>

2212
01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:03.210
<v Speaker 1>it's the one that sort of handed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the,</v>

2213
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.360
<v Speaker 1>to the audience for both of you for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>time now.</v>

2214
01:38:06.361 --> 01:38:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I've wanted to start doing something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect liberty and western values,</v>

2215
01:38:09.451 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have no idea where to start.</v>

2216
01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 1>What's the most useful thing I can do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start as an average person?</v>

2217
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that my answer,</v>

2218
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:21.030
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of the same answer as to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you just do in life generally.</v>

2219
01:38:21.031 --> 01:38:26.031
<v Speaker 3>Find something that you're good at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find something you like to do and find </v>

2220
01:38:26.031 --> 01:38:26.490
<v Speaker 3>something that's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And where are those three things kind of</v>

2221
01:38:26.850 --> 01:38:27.590
<v Speaker 3>conflate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2222
01:38:27.591 --> 01:38:28.830
<v Speaker 3>what are those three things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overlap.</v>

2223
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:34.070
<v Speaker 3>That's where you're going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>happiest and that's where you're gonna </v>

2224
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:35.720
<v Speaker 3>feel you're making a difference because </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you only have two of those three </v>

2225
01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.881
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're butting your head against a </v>

2226
01:38:37.881 --> 01:38:39.291
<v Speaker 3>brick wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you'd like to do something and you </v>

2227
01:38:39.291 --> 01:38:39.291
<v Speaker 3>think that it's going to influence other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2228
01:38:39.291 --> 01:38:39.291
<v Speaker 3>but you suck at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to work for you.</v>

2229
01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:42.410
<v Speaker 3>So try to openly identify your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>skillset,</v>

2230
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:44.400
<v Speaker 3>find what it is that you're good at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then figure,</v>

2231
01:38:44.401 --> 01:38:46.860
<v Speaker 3>how do I use this skill set something </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at and enjoy doing?</v>

2232
01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.250
<v Speaker 3>How do I use that for a purpose that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is useful,</v>

2233
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.920
<v Speaker 3>and it sounds like you already have your</v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose.</v>

2234
01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:56.790
<v Speaker 3>It's just a question of what can you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that actually helps effectuate that</v>

2235
01:38:56.791 --> 01:38:58.650
<v Speaker 3>purpose without knowing your skillset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2236
01:38:58.651 --> 01:39:03.651
<v Speaker 3>but if I knew your skillset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I could help define what you could </v>

2237
01:39:03.651 --> 01:39:03.651
<v Speaker 3>do with that to get from point a to </v>
<v Speaker 3>point b.</v>

2238
01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.550
<v Speaker 1>So I suspect you probably.</v>

2239
01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:07.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what about the courage,</v>

2240
01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:08.960
<v Speaker 5>but I would just add a little bit to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2241
01:39:08.961 --> 01:39:12.770
<v Speaker 5>It's like there are some things that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>will see that will bother you.</v>

2242
01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:16.130
<v Speaker 5>Some of those are your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they bother you.</v>

2243
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:21.270
<v Speaker 5>Like there's lots of things in the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are happening that don't bother </v>

2244
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.270
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're not your problems.</v>

2245
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:22.790
<v Speaker 5>The things that bother you for some </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason or your problems.</v>

2246
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:27.290
<v Speaker 5>Find something that bothers you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you could fix,</v>

2247
01:39:27.291 --> 01:39:29.390
<v Speaker 5>that you could start fixing and start </v>
<v Speaker 5>fixing it.</v>

2248
01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:30.440
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

2249
01:39:30.650 --> 01:39:32.900
<v Speaker 5>And you know you should do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>competently.</v>

2250
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:36.110
<v Speaker 5>Doing a domain where you're competent in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a domain where you're interested,</v>

2251
01:39:36.111 --> 01:39:41.111
<v Speaker 5>but there are things that you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 5>around you that you think couldn't be </v>

2252
01:39:41.111 --> 01:39:42.380
<v Speaker 5>set right that you could set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2253
01:39:42.381 --> 01:39:44.030
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go for it.</v>

2254
01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:49.060
<v Speaker 5>You'll get good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you will get bigger and bigger </v>

2255
01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:49.060
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2256
01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:49.060
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2257
01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:49.730
<v Speaker 5>that's where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Start small.</v>

2258
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:50.840
<v Speaker 5>You won't end small.</v>

2259
01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can tell you in the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate way as you guys are now in my </v>

2260
01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:56.340
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my studio that we built,</v>

2261
01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:57.550
<v Speaker 1>that's funded by the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this.</v>

2262
01:39:57.551 --> 01:40:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I just had an idea that I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>

2263
01:40:00.041 --> 01:40:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I started a youtube channel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally everyone watching this can do.</v>

2264
01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.150
<v Speaker 1>You start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2265
