34
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked,</v>

35
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on the Tan and I've </v>

37
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a black Republican,</v>

38
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that was the head of the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

39
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I imagine they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain that to me.</v>

40
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It's called history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

41
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.793
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of folks really don't </v>

42
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:45.051
<v Speaker 2>appreciate the very unique history </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Republican,</v>

43
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 2>the Republican Party and the black </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

44
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 2>It is our political home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

45
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 2>it is where we first emerged in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country politically,</v>

46
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and certainly,</v>

47
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.691
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:01:57.691 --> 00:01:58.524
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln and the abolitionist and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact the party was born out of a </v>

49
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 2>fight between abolitionists and wigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 2>over the issue of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

51
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thankfully the abolitionists one and the</v>

52
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party was essentially formed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Frederick Douglass,</v>

53
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>a notable African American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a slave and free.</v>

54
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 2>A man was very much a part of helping to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build this party.</v>

55
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 2>So we've got this very unique history </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a young,</v>

56
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 2>a young kid of 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 2>looking at getting involved politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time,</v>

58
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

59
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 2>my mom who was a Roosevelt Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family,</v>

61
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very much democrats.</v>

62
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:40.854
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

63
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 2>my mother raised me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

64
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out there and discover and,</v>

65
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:46.124
<v Speaker 2>and decide for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let our party affiliation of what </v>

66
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 2>we're doing and fluency just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're Democrats.</v>

67
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:52.494
<v Speaker 2>And your onset a Democrat and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother's Democrat and your </v>

68
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 2>grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>

69
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.031
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

70
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 2>your cousins are Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

71
00:02:58.831 --> 00:02:59.664
<v Speaker 2>no pressure</v>

72
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.980
<v Speaker 2>out at night did the study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

73
00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

74
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.420
<v Speaker 2>this is our home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the political home for the party</v>

75
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.600
<v Speaker 2>of Ronald Reagan was running for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president in [inaudible] 76.</v>

76
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.090
<v Speaker 2>At that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my first election to vote in.</v>

77
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.463
<v Speaker 2>And he sounded a lot like my mom in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of how my mother talked to me </v>

78
00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:20.390
<v Speaker 2>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

79
00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:23.360
<v Speaker 2>as a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in this country,</v>

80
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

81
00:03:24.411 --> 00:03:26.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having opportunities,</v>

82
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:28.880
<v Speaker 2>taking advantages of opportunities so </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected,</v>

83
00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:30.980
<v Speaker 2>it resonated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

84
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went and told mom,</v>

85
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.901
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:34.760
<v Speaker 2>I registered as a Republican and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at me.</v>

87
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.331
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord,</v>

88
00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 2>what's the watch?</v>

89
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all been good.</v>

90
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lot of the history,</v>

91
00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:43.730
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'm going to guess that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the people here would say,</v>

92
00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:46.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't seem to be the party.</v>

93
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

94
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hate playing identity politics.</v>

95
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

96
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get into that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

97
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 2>that's a slippery slope on so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels for both parties who've,</v>

98
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.290
<v Speaker 2>who've really screwed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 2>our politics with identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

100
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.813
<v Speaker 2>and we can have that discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there is a legitimacy to </v>

101
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the point that we have,</v>

102
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I think failed over the last 50 years to</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate that history.</v>

103
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:15.484
<v Speaker 2>And I started with a history because to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me it is an important place to start </v>

104
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

105
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you then follow that into,</v>

106
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight that would later come on,</v>

107
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.394
<v Speaker 2>civil rights and the Republican leaders </v>
<v Speaker 2>who themselves conservatives at that </v>

108
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like their,</v>

109
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>their forefathers politically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

110
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 2>the abolitionists were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're stewards of this ideal,</v>

111
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Senate in the house.</v>

112
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Johnson,</v>

113
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:46.354
<v Speaker 2>Lyndon Johnson knew that and yet a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political decision was made for Kras </v>

114
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 2>political gain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

115
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 2>and that was to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

116
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.543
<v Speaker 2>that national politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of controlling the presidency </v>

117
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:02.251
<v Speaker 2>or winning elections for Congress meant </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than other things.</v>

118
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

119
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>we walked away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we walked away from the black community,</v>

120
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

121
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 2>and I think we are still paying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>price for that.</v>

122
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's a good setup for the </v>

123
00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:14.570
<v Speaker 1>first part here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

124
00:05:14.571 --> 00:05:15.404
<v Speaker 1>what does being a Republican in Twenty </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 in America right now with our system </v>

125
00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:21.260
<v Speaker 1>is so screwed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so wacky.</v>

126
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like people don't even know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that meant to you.</v>

127
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.030
<v Speaker 2>They've lost meaning because it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten con conflated into,</v>

128
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other labels.</v>

129
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:31.970
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

130
00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:32.804
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where this tea party as conservative or </v>

131
00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:39.320
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just make the case that at the end</v>

132
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 2>of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

133
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.690
<v Speaker 2>there there's a thread of value or of </v>
<v Speaker 2>values or principles,</v>

134
00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:48.560
<v Speaker 2>ideals that you ascribe to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it is,</v>

135
00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:49.394
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your view on the role of government in </v>

136
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:53.690
<v Speaker 2>the lives of the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

137
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.733
<v Speaker 2>historically Republicans have not been </v>
<v Speaker 2>antigovernment they been for limited </v>

138
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.784
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think government is the legitimate </v>

139
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.213
<v Speaker 2>as a legitimate entity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a legitimate purpose though </v>

140
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:05.700
<v Speaker 2>unlimited purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

141
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.450
<v Speaker 2>whether that thread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

142
00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:08.284
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or idea centers around how you view the </v>

143
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words that,</v>

144
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morality and concerns for the unborn or </v>

145
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever the issues may be that that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of that narrative.</v>

146
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are broader,</v>

147
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 2>they're broader strokes that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>used,</v>

148
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

149
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.280
<v Speaker 2>or sort of stripped down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

150
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>in a way that gets us into this crass </v>
<v Speaker 2>political discussion about,</v>

151
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong on an issue.</v>

152
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's never,</v>

153
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>that's never really the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the,</v>

154
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I kind of sum it up this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

155
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:45.674
<v Speaker 2>I look at the Party and I certainly saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>this as a county chairman and as </v>

156
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 2>national chairman and a state chairman </v>
<v Speaker 2>that even in a state like Maryland,</v>

157
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I had western Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was very conservative.</v>

158
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I had where I lived in Prince George's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the beltway area,</v>

159
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>which was very liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had southern Maryland,</v>

160
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 2>which was conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trending purple,</v>

161
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 2>so you had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different dynamics,</v>

163
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.963
<v Speaker 2>and you have to kind of lead in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to govern in that and you </v>

164
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 2>realize that politics is really about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the art of the possible is not about the</v>

165
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 2>art of the angry or scoring points or </v>
<v Speaker 2>gaining advantage.</v>

166
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 2>It really is about how do I take all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these disparate parts,</v>

167
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and different viewpoints and,</v>

168
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.673
<v Speaker 2>and figuring out how to effect a </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive change or policy of positive </v>

169
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 2>change on a set of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.293
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and that that's gotten lost today </v>

171
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:40.664
<v Speaker 2>in his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've seen this play out right now </v>

172
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:43.210
<v Speaker 2>in the GLP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

173
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.113
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this internet icn struggle over </v>

174
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who we are,</v>

175
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 2>what we believe and why we value that.</v>

176
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to the,</v>

177
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.150
<v Speaker 1>to the point of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what the party actually stands for,</v>

178
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm always amazed by the fact that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take to like hot button issues that </v>

179
00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:01.180
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are clearly democrat pocket issues,</v>

180
00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:05.500
<v Speaker 1>gay rights and legalizing marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are Democrat issues.</v>

181
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:05.940
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

182
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.671
<v Speaker 1>there for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:08:06.671 --> 00:08:09.730
<v Speaker 1>basically for legalizing weed basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>for gay rights.</v>

184
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me a true Republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would want small government.</v>

185
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:14.224
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't care what someone does in </v>

186
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:16.054
<v Speaker 1>their bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's having sex with someone of </v>

187
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:20.290
<v Speaker 1>the same sex or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether smoking weed,</v>

188
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't that be a republican issue?</v>

189
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

190
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that it probably wants was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that remember that the gop also has,</v>

191
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.680
<v Speaker 2>as a part of its roots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a libertarian threat,</v>

192
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:35.350
<v Speaker 2>a very strong libertarian thread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

193
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:36.184
<v Speaker 2>I've always been amused that those who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would argue about the limited role </v>

194
00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:45.751
<v Speaker 2>of government on one issue but then </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue for the expansion of government on</v>

195
00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

196
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.231
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

197
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:48.400
<v Speaker 1>that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

198
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.273
<v Speaker 1>so that</v>

199
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.560
<v Speaker 2>being authentically consistent for me is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>

200
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like when people ask me about my </v>
<v Speaker 2>views on life and,</v>

201
00:08:57.221 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 2>and I tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

202
00:08:58.201 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm prolife,</v>

203
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much pro life in a lot of has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come from how I was raised.</v>

204
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:06.050
<v Speaker 2>It comes from my faith tradition and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been taught and,</v>

205
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 2>and come to believe in value life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it comes to the death penalty,</v>

206
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm against it and I always get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

207
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 2>how can you be against the death </v>
<v Speaker 2>penalty?</v>

208
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm prolife,</v>

209
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to be consistent from </v>

210
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:21.660
<v Speaker 2>beginning to the end and that's not what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see happening.</v>

211
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.213
<v Speaker 2>Can you think of a politician off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of your head that's consistent </v>

212
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:25.960
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really is,</v>

213
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 2>is governing off a real set of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't take anybody.</v>

214
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you think anyone?</v>

215
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Can any of you think of anyone?</v>

216
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Anyone that's governing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

217
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.433
<v Speaker 2>Because they're not allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not allowed to do it because </v>

218
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:37.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

219
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.753
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tensions inside both caucus of </v>

220
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Cockeye are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

221
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.090
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are such the Latin coming back is,</v>

222
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.951
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

223
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so,</v>

224
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.740
<v Speaker 2>so intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

225
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.890
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

226
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.900
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in DC and so the nation's </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital has been in my backyard forever.</v>

227
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.143
<v Speaker 2>And so I remember Washington when it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun to be in Washington and you could </v>

228
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>

229
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I used to go sit on the capital steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11:00</v>

230
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 2>when I was in high school with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>buddies,</v>

231
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 2>we'd grab a liter of coke and</v>

232
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.310
<v Speaker 1>bag of chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Soda,</v>

233
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>the Soda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just seeing what is your guide?</v>

234
00:10:17.601 --> 00:10:18.411
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

235
00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:19.490
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

236
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.093
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I threw in liter of coke because I used </v>

237
00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:25.360
<v Speaker 1>to say I used to grab some coke and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bag of chips.</v>

238
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.321
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

239
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:28.280
<v Speaker 1>soda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

240
00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so I got.</v>

241
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.383
<v Speaker 1>We would sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we would sit on the steps or you </v>

242
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:31.990
<v Speaker 1>hang out with him,</v>

243
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Capitol police and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see members coming back and they</v>

244
00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:36.184
<v Speaker 2>taught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to restaurants in town and you </v>

245
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.700
<v Speaker 2>could see a table where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

246
00:10:39.701 --> 00:10:41.980
<v Speaker 2>a conservative or a Democrat or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>

247
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:45.340
<v Speaker 2>they weren't conservative liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a republican and Democrat would</v>

248
00:10:45.341 --> 00:10:48.460
<v Speaker 2>be off talking policy or just shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the breeze.</v>

249
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.590
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

250
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.480
<v Speaker 2>they don't mix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't talk,</v>

251
00:10:52.481 --> 00:10:56.590
<v Speaker 2>they don't integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be a part of this.</v>

252
00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.920
<v Speaker 2>They don't bring their families here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go back to the districts which they</v>

253
00:10:59.921 --> 00:11:00.754
<v Speaker 2>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's this disconnect and the </v>

254
00:11:02.801 --> 00:11:05.770
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that is what we see now </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

255
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.600
<v Speaker 2>there is no reason for me to work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

256
00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:08.434
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was chairman and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing a getting ready for the 2010 </v>

257
00:11:12.101 --> 00:11:12.731
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your course,</v>

258
00:11:12.731 --> 00:11:13.564
<v Speaker 2>you're going out and you're meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates and you're sort of </v>

259
00:11:14.801 --> 00:11:15.634
<v Speaker 2>interviewing them to see who you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>line up and support and who you and not </v>

260
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.790
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

261
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.060
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met this one candidate and we got into</v>

262
00:11:22.061 --> 00:11:23.320
<v Speaker 2>a nice conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.620
<v Speaker 2>solid rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rip conservative and he's coming.</v>

264
00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:28.900
<v Speaker 2>He is fire and brimstone ready to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Washington.</v>

265
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.090
<v Speaker 2>And so we were talking and I said </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about what will,</v>

266
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.250
<v Speaker 2>you know when you get to DC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:35.170
<v Speaker 2>because at that time the dems were still</v>
<v Speaker 2>in charge and said,</v>

268
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the real interesting challenges </v>

269
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.253
<v Speaker 2>is going to be working with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the leadership on the other side </v>

270
00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:42.060
<v Speaker 2>and working with Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

271
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

272
00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:46.450
<v Speaker 2>excuse me doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

273
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 2>why are you coming to Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

274
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming into work with Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the attitude.</v>

275
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.050
<v Speaker 1>That's double down with</v>

276
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.900
<v Speaker 2>a 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

277
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of things.</v>

278
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not just tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people put a lot of pressure on</v>

279
00:11:59.071 --> 00:11:59.904
<v Speaker 2>tea party and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the tea party came into being on my </v>

280
00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:06.120
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know very well what was the,</v>

281
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.373
<v Speaker 2>the essence of that in that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what people don't recognize is that </v>

282
00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:15.840
<v Speaker 2>movement such as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that energy started way before 2009.</v>

283
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.033
<v Speaker 2>This goes back to 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This goes back to 2002 big government </v>

284
00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:23.580
<v Speaker 2>republicanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The spending on the war,</v>

285
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:25.730
<v Speaker 2>the Terry Shy vo case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember the Terry Shive.</v>

286
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the republic is called the Senate,</v>

287
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:29.664
<v Speaker 2>back into session two to pass a bill to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent this family from the making </v>

288
00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:35.880
<v Speaker 2>decision about this poor woman who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a coma.</v>

289
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.733
<v Speaker 1>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the people that want </v>

290
00:12:37.251 --> 00:12:40.610
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand you say,</v>

291
00:12:40.611 --> 00:12:43.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>government should be out of the way,</v>

292
00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 1>but then the other you're going to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress into session to pass</v>

293
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.940
<v Speaker 2>bill to tell someone what they can't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this instance.</v>

294
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.253
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the conundrum that the parties </v>

295
00:12:53.031 --> 00:12:53.670
<v Speaker 2>put itself.</v>

296
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.590
<v Speaker 1>So who do you like out of this group?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

297
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I met you a couple of weeks ago that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the spin room at the gop debate and I</v>

298
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.563
<v Speaker 1>was able to ask Scott Walker a question </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I asked him about campaign finance </v>

299
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and I got to tell you sometimes you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at someone and you go,</v>

300
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.520
<v Speaker 1>this guy is dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

301
00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 1>he struck me as dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

302
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.980
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

303
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I could just see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

304
00:13:13.381 --> 00:13:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just look at him and see,</v>

305
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.603
<v Speaker 1>this is not a bright guy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to comment on that </v>

306
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not dumb.</v>

307
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.520
<v Speaker 1>He's won a lot of elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted more than any of those guys.</v>

308
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.620
<v Speaker 1>But what do you think of the general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general crop?</v>

309
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:34.310
<v Speaker 2>I think the general crop overall is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong group of individuals.</v>

310
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the governors,</v>

311
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.920
<v Speaker 2>the governors that are in the race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

312
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.750
<v Speaker 2>or were in the race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

313
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:45.510
<v Speaker 2>you look at the senators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Carly Fiorina,</v>

314
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.520
<v Speaker 2>very successful businesswoman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carly,</v>

315
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.440
<v Speaker 2>a Ben Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very successful a neurosurgeon.</v>

316
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a diverse group.</v>

317
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.660
<v Speaker 2>It is the most diverse field we put up </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

318
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just in terms of a woman and </v>
<v Speaker 2>African American,</v>

319
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:02.064
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just in terms of background and </v>

320
00:14:03.331 --> 00:14:04.770
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the depth of it.</v>

321
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Jeb Bush was a very successful,</v>

322
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.920
<v Speaker 2>did a good job as governor and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>

323
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elected strongly two times a John </v>

324
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Casick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing in Ohio.</v>

325
00:14:15.991 --> 00:14:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I went through hell in the first term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

326
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.250
<v Speaker 2>and weather that storm.</v>

327
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.373
<v Speaker 1>What did you make a case answer to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The to the gay marriage question in the </v>

328
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 1>first year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

329
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a beautiful thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that was an option inauthentically</v>

330
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Republican response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

331
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 2>that and Jeb Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he talked about,</v>

332
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration again and authentically </v>

333
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:38.644
<v Speaker 2>Republican response because at the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the day what Jeff was saying and he </v>

334
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 2>used the language that people could </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

335
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:47.660
<v Speaker 2>He didn't come at it and policy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>political ease.</v>

336
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 2>He used the word love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to me and to a whole lot of people</v>

337
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:53.174
<v Speaker 2>was a recognition of people behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy that while you can sit back and </v>

338
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 2>talk all the smack about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build walls and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to electrify the marina and do all</v>

340
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:05.840
<v Speaker 2>this crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>

341
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:11.020
<v Speaker 2>there are people behind that and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't appreciate that,</v>

342
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have a good policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

343
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.703
<v Speaker 2>it's not a smart policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that was something my </v>

344
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.213
<v Speaker 2>takeaway in his discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was a very humble and a </v>

345
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 2>very personal way to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>

346
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.930
<v Speaker 2>No one ever talked about it on either </v>
<v Speaker 2>side in those terms and,</v>

347
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:31.803
<v Speaker 2>and I thought he did well by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a way you kind of want to combine </v>

348
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:36.404
<v Speaker 2>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could combine a couple of the </v>

349
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Candida.</v>

350
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

351
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.103
<v Speaker 2>well we're doing pretty good on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankenstein part without the </v>

352
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:46.820
<v Speaker 2>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

353
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they're in a real sense.</v>

354
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:49.424
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

355
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 2>what I'm looking for at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

356
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I like John Casick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Jeb.</v>

357
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean I like a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm looking for,</v>

358
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 2>and I've said this from the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the cycle,</v>

359
00:15:57.651 --> 00:15:58.484
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for someone who's prepared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sacrifice their race for the </v>

360
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 2>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's going to take.</v>

361
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.790
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jeb got close.</v>

362
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:08.624
<v Speaker 2>He used the words when he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to lose the primary to win </v>

363
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>the general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really sit there and go,</v>

364
00:16:16.071 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

365
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just cut the crap.</v>

366
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.110
<v Speaker 2>You want too much and we can't deliver.</v>

367
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.500
<v Speaker 2>That's how the conversation starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it gets you into spending.</v>

368
00:16:29.501 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 2>It gets you into programs that gets you </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the size of government,</v>

369
00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:32.774
<v Speaker 2>that gets you into policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets you into everything that you </v>

370
00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:35.914
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are our own worst enemies as </v>

371
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Americans because we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did we say folks?</v>

372
00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:44.491
<v Speaker 2>We say cut spending last government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why want more in my paycheck?</v>

373
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.353
<v Speaker 2>And then in the next sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you put more money in that </v>

374
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:50.440
<v Speaker 2>program?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't you spending more on this?</v>

375
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't you giving to this cause over</v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

376
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.673
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question for me is always boiled </v>

377
00:16:56.771 --> 00:16:58.450
<v Speaker 2>down very simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know the model,</v>

378
00:16:58.451 --> 00:16:59.284
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did a little economics in school </v>

379
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

380
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:04.210
<v Speaker 2>you know the whole idea of guns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>butter,</v>

381
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was always you.</v>

382
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.620
<v Speaker 2>You can either have guns or you can have</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter.</v>

383
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Well I think there's a different model </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can actually have both,</v>

384
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.080
<v Speaker 2>but the only way you get to have both is</v>
<v Speaker 2>by prioritizing.</v>

385
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Because in any given moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at any given time,</v>

386
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.500
<v Speaker 2>something is going to be the priority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we focus on.</v>

387
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:24.334
<v Speaker 2>Let's address that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means we're going to spend a </v>

388
00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:26.134
<v Speaker 2>little bit less on guns today and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>on butter because we need to put people </v>

389
00:17:29.561 --> 00:17:30.394
<v Speaker 2>back to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to make sure that a hospital </v>

390
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.750
<v Speaker 2>stay open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We may need to make sure that,</v>

391
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.640
<v Speaker 2>oh gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bridge is falling down.</v>

392
00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:37.830
<v Speaker 2>We need to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

393
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the priority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we put a little bit more into that at</v>

394
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:44.050
<v Speaker 2>another time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The priorities may shift.</v>

395
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.273
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's something that happens </v>

396
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:47.074
<v Speaker 2>overseas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis gets stoop more than they already </v>

397
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you've got to deal with that,</v>

398
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 2>then we maybe we spend a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

399
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.123
<v Speaker 2>We reprioritize and we don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is government gets out </v>

400
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

401
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 2>we're going to impose these restrictions</v>
<v Speaker 2>were going to make you do this and we're</v>

402
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 2>gonna give you all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

403
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy with that.</v>

404
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

405
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 2>People like stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like stuff.</v>

406
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one ever goes back to see or find</v>

407
00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 2>out how the stuff is working and whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not the program that you've designed,</v>

408
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:26.540
<v Speaker 2>no child left behind actually works for </v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers in the classroom or whether you</v>

409
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 2>know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the institution that you've created,</v>

410
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.713
<v Speaker 2>our social safety net in all of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>various forms actually meets the needs </v>

411
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.170
<v Speaker 2>of the people who supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated.</v>

412
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I thinking right now the va,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>

413
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>making government accountable for all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is important,</v>

414
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:45.923
<v Speaker 2>but also the role that we play in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>process is equally important because </v>

415
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:50.604
<v Speaker 2>what's happened now is our politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're telling them every different </v>

416
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 2>thing and so if you come at this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come at this way,</v>

417
00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 2>you come at this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>

418
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 2>They just stand still and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing and then they don't.</v>

419
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.733
<v Speaker 2>They're not governed by a basic set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles that you talked about </v>

420
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:04.490
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they are going every week,</v>

421
00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:05.324
<v Speaker 2>so they're going every which way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're given everybody anything and </v>

422
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:10.090
<v Speaker 2>they're just sitting back on what asks </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want and I'm done.</v>

423
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.450
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

424
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:15.390
<v Speaker 2>we are actually looking for someone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take the risk,</v>

425
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.253
<v Speaker 2>which is the bottom line point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you prepared to take the risk to do </v>

426
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:22.740
<v Speaker 2>the job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was lieutenant governor,</v>

427
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.980
<v Speaker 2>my approach to being lieutenant </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor,</v>

428
00:19:24.981 --> 00:19:25.814
<v Speaker 2>it was only have four years to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>job because the other four aren't </v>

429
00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 2>guaranteed and they weren't because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't win the election,</v>

430
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.400
<v Speaker 2>but I walked out having reformed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority business enterprise,</v>

431
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 2>got charter school law passed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

432
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.393
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and worked on a number of initiatives </v>

433
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:46.470
<v Speaker 2>including the death penalty that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor asked me to work on.</v>

434
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I felt that we had done the job that</v>

435
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:54.840
<v Speaker 2>people have sent us to do a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the politics took over in that case.</v>

436
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:56.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.700
<v Speaker 2>the governor of Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that then my buddy Bob Ehrlich got fired</v>

438
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 2>with a 62 percent job approval on </v>
<v Speaker 2>election day.</v>

439
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

440
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:05.364
<v Speaker 2>people hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans in 2006 because of the war </v>

441
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.750
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

442
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.320
<v Speaker 2>but you do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't think about the next election.</v>

443
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.243
<v Speaker 2>And right now our politicians are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about being primary or losing </v>

444
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:20.280
<v Speaker 2>an election and they don't do the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really where I want to go with</v>

445
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:21.114
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you want the 30 seconds to do </v>

446
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:23.730
<v Speaker 2>trump or should we just tell we get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

447
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:24.750
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty seconds go.</v>

448
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.130
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is an enigma wrapped in a question</v>

449
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:29.964
<v Speaker 2>mark wrapped in.</v>

450
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a lot in a wig.</v>

451
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.581
<v Speaker 2>The Wig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

452
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's all these things.</v>

453
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.500
<v Speaker 2>He's all these things that have upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>the status quo of American politics.</v>

454
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:42.923
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to run a conventional </v>

455
00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:46.344
<v Speaker 2>campaign except trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's running an unconventional path </v>

456
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.033
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else was running a </v>

457
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:52.654
<v Speaker 2>conventional campaign in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconventional time and they don't know </v>

458
00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:57.304
<v Speaker 2>how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll deal with it or what to do with </v>

459
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he is,</v>

460
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not he gets the nomination.</v>

461
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 2>All of that remains to be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Folks.</v>

462
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:07.120
<v Speaker 2>We're a long way from the first vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being cast</v>

463
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 1>over a year away from the election does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not know,</v>

464
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.240
<v Speaker 2>but we're actually only three months </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the first primary caucus votes</v>

465
00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:16.074
<v Speaker 2>and that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the real rubber begins to </v>

466
00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:19.194
<v Speaker 2>meet the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what voters actually have to go </v>

467
00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:21.414
<v Speaker 2>into a caucus room like this or in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>voting booth and actually think about </v>

468
00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:27.630
<v Speaker 2>who are they're going to give this next </v>
<v Speaker 2>charge,</v>

469
00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:29.190
<v Speaker 2>two to be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

470
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.183
<v Speaker 2>and I think that dynamic as you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this third debate on the fourth </v>

471
00:21:33.631 --> 00:21:37.230
<v Speaker 2>debate in December and then into </v>
<v Speaker 2>January,</v>

472
00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:38.064
<v Speaker 2>we'll begin to settle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But trump has changed the way we do </v>

473
00:21:40.711 --> 00:21:42.960
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's good.</v>

474
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

475
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I talked to people all across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

476
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.950
<v Speaker 2>They don't like what he said about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans.</v>

477
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.020
<v Speaker 2>They don't like the way he talks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

478
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.210
<v Speaker 2>They don't like a lot about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

479
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.860
<v Speaker 2>every sentence that starts like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next word is.</v>

480
00:21:58.861 --> 00:22:03.090
<v Speaker 2>But I don't like what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

481
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

482
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.460
<v Speaker 2>and I keep telling folks in DC as long </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they're saying,</v>

483
00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:12.030
<v Speaker 2>but then anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything can happen.</v>

484
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.990
<v Speaker 1>So is that the interesting thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about both parties right now,</v>

485
00:22:14.991 --> 00:22:17.870
<v Speaker 1>because trump and Bernie to me are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting on the same thing,</v>

486
00:22:17.871 --> 00:22:20.180
<v Speaker 1>which is that the system is broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

487
00:22:20.181 --> 00:22:22.070
<v Speaker 1>in the first debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump basically said,</v>

488
00:22:22.071 --> 00:22:22.521
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

489
00:22:22.521 --> 00:22:23.354
<v Speaker 1>I gave Hillary a lot of money and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed up at my wedding because that's </v>

490
00:22:26.151 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 1>how politicians operate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

491
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's telling the truth on that side.</v>

492
00:22:30.351 --> 00:22:32.240
<v Speaker 1>So you have the capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

493
00:22:32.241 --> 00:22:35.630
<v Speaker 1>The poster child for capitalism and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poster child for socialism.</v>

494
00:22:35.631 --> 00:22:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And those are the two that are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken away.</v>

495
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.580
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make it?</v>

496
00:22:38.581 --> 00:22:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's your ticket next year.</v>

497
00:22:39.711 --> 00:22:43.730
<v Speaker 1>That's not set that sanders versus trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>

498
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to be at that part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have myself a gin and tonic</v>

499
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.193
<v Speaker 1>and popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that to be really like </v>

500
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 1>in the debate if it was the two of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>

501
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Because Bernie's people you unfiltered </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's off his rocker.</v>

502
00:23:01.401 --> 00:23:02.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be something,</v>

503
00:23:02.151 --> 00:23:02.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

504
00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:03.374
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is Bernie unfiltered and trump </v>

505
00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 1>office rock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Bernie,</v>

506
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.000
<v Speaker 1>because he is a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

507
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Why can't Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't trump be unfiltered to.</v>

508
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:11.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

509
00:23:11.271 --> 00:23:13.730
<v Speaker 1>trump is unfiltered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing beneath the filter.</v>

510
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.733
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tell that to all the people are </v>

511
00:23:18.081 --> 00:23:19.710
<v Speaker 1>following them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to tell,</v>

512
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.733
<v Speaker 1>but they're not listening.</v>

513
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Making the more important point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks keep missing.</v>

514
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.590
<v Speaker 2>It's that I'm not.</v>

515
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Bring it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring that attitude.</v>

516
00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's that attitude</v>

517
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.513
<v Speaker 2>that's pissing everybody off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you know better than the </v>

518
00:23:38.431 --> 00:23:39.630
<v Speaker 2>person who's following him</v>

519
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.310
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not,</v>

520
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.713
<v Speaker 1>that's just not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to respect best where our </v>

521
00:23:45.711 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 1>politics has gotten to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've stopped respecting the fact that I</v>

522
00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:53.030
<v Speaker 1>can follow you because I actually like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying even though you think</v>

523
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:54.440
<v Speaker 1>he's full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

524
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.633
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

525
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:56.880
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

526
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's.</v>

527
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.670
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the American process.</v>

528
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.140
<v Speaker 1>So to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to judge it.</v>

529
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.013
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't judge it out loud because </v>

530
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.000
<v Speaker 1>then I may hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have.</v>

531
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm saying so I'm with you on that.</v>

532
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 1>But to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

533
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:15.530
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a real candidacy that I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think.</v>

534
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:16.520
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you say that?</v>

535
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.500
<v Speaker 1>We'll revisit this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

536
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:17.970
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

537
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 1>he is filed the paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's disclosed his income.</v>

538
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.860
<v Speaker 1>He's got a campaign organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

539
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:25.820
<v Speaker 1>This brother's got a camp</v>

540
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.720
<v Speaker 2>paint organization in a number of states</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people don't even know.</v>

541
00:24:28.721 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 2>He's got a campaign organization in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing the things.</v>

542
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what was a telling moment?</v>

543
00:24:33.881 --> 00:24:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of you caught it?</v>

544
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Remember when he wrote out his economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan?</v>

545
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:42.720
<v Speaker 2>What did you notice about what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody trump tower.</v>

546
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.070
<v Speaker 2>It's everything's that comm tower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no cards.</v>

547
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was not read off the top of his head.</v>

548
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.380
<v Speaker 2>He read off of prepared text.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is in this thing the right way.</v>

549
00:24:59.080 --> 00:24:59.913
<v Speaker 2>Everything he's done up to now has </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten your attention and now he's </v>

550
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.670
<v Speaker 2>rolling out a little policy on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little policy I'm telling you.</v>

551
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.623
<v Speaker 2>Watch it because the attitude of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks in Washington about his campaign </v>

552
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 2>is the thing that keeps him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera.</v>

553
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

554
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do get.</v>

555
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I know you hate hearing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

556
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:20.151
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

557
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:20.984
<v Speaker 1>Well I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can hear something and being </v>

558
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

559
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.833
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huffington Post says they're not going </v>

560
00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:26.820
<v Speaker 1>to write about him in the politics and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

561
00:25:26.821 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 1>that gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets the base,</v>

562
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.391
<v Speaker 1>the base angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

563
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:31.240
<v Speaker 1>So that was the longest 30 seconds I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

564
00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Trope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

565
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.653
<v Speaker 1>So let's just talk about the system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics because you're an insider and </v>

566
00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:36.224
<v Speaker 1>an outsider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you were the chairman of the </v>

567
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of the job,</v>

568
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:42.314
<v Speaker 1>how much of your day to day was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>about money because that's what this is </v>

569
00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>really all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's be clear,</v>

570
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.600
<v Speaker 2>be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

571
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.720
<v Speaker 2>the role of any party chairman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>

572
00:25:52.721 --> 00:25:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Republican counties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state national is two things.</v>

573
00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.990
<v Speaker 2>They only have two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raise money and win elections.</v>

574
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.630
<v Speaker 2>If you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing your job.</v>

575
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.920
<v Speaker 2>So your day is made up of doing those </v>
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>

576
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.800
<v Speaker 2>That is 80 percent of your day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

577
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.673
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on a good day where you will spend </v>

578
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.160
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from two to four hours dialing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for dollars,</v>

579
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.520
<v Speaker 2>which they're very few of us like doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's just tough to raise.</v>

580
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.231
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling,</v>

581
00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:29.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking you for $38,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

582
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of presumption in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

583
00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

584
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.903
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because that's the maximum you can </v>

585
00:26:35.231 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 2>give.</v>

586
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Did they give you a list?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

587
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:37.880
<v Speaker 1>right when you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

588
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>we get their first day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

589
00:26:39.051 --> 00:26:40.630
<v Speaker 1>here's the list you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the phone.</v>

590
00:26:40.631 --> 00:26:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was elected on a Friday and</v>

591
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.993
<v Speaker 2>that Monday I went up to New York and </v>
<v Speaker 2>did a town hall on healthcare and the </v>

592
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:51.420
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

593
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:56.421
<v Speaker 2>that Tuesday I was at my desk officially</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time at the desk and I did</v>

594
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.660
<v Speaker 2>a three and a half hours with the calls </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

595
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 2>for donors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what I did was,</v>

596
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:02.544
<v Speaker 2>it was the idea was I needed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce myself to these folks because </v>

597
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm the new kid on the block.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

598
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some of them I was a little bit more</v>

599
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:16.221
<v Speaker 2>of a shock than they anticipated and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it was more introduction,</v>

600
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.001
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

601
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:20.670
<v Speaker 2>you kind of roll into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually had a donut cussed me out</v>

602
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.230
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:23.064
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sick of the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I hear from you people is </v>

604
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.390
<v Speaker 2>when you call asking for money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not giving you another damn dime,</v>

605
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>da Da.</v>

606
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.093
<v Speaker 2>And I let him vent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His brother went on for like 20 minutes </v>

607
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.360
<v Speaker 2>and I let him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let him talk.</v>

608
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.223
<v Speaker 2>And then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually I wasn't calling to ask </v>

609
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:36.894
<v Speaker 2>for money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just calling to introduce myself </v>

610
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 2>and you wouldn't have said no to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

611
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.310
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't given any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

612
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.350
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this was the point.</v>

613
00:27:46.351 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 2>And this is another important lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I think you do this,</v>

614
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:50.754
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I listened to this man because here </v>

615
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:55.610
<v Speaker 2>is a longtime donor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

616
00:27:55.611 --> 00:27:56.444
<v Speaker 2>an activist in the party supporter who </v>
<v Speaker 2>is now ticked off at its leadership at </v>

617
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:04.200
<v Speaker 2>the political operations and wants no </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>

618
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.940
<v Speaker 2>So I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

619
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:06.691
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

620
00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting together a business plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I did.</v>

621
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I put together a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a business guy.</v>

622
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:11.244
<v Speaker 2>So I've put together a business plan for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Party and said we've got to raise </v>

623
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:15.690
<v Speaker 2>money and how are we going to spend it?</v>

624
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:20.340
<v Speaker 2>These are things that are priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got that together,</v>

625
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a period of time,</v>

626
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:25.350
<v Speaker 2>but I told him I was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also told,</v>

627
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:28.080
<v Speaker 2>laid out to him what I wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what my vision was,</v>

628
00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 2>and I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

629
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't want your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

630
00:28:30.331 --> 00:28:31.164
<v Speaker 2>you wait and see if I do the job to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction and if you feel like </v>

631
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:36.324
<v Speaker 2>giving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give us,</v>

632
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.193
<v Speaker 2>give us a check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two weeks later you sent the check for </v>

633
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 2>the maximum amount because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

634
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:44.160
<v Speaker 2>and he told me in his note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

635
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 2>you listened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you took the time to listen to me.</v>

636
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is a big difference.</v>

637
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:53.724
<v Speaker 2>Listening to people goes so goes so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the money piece is a big part of </v>

638
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe money is property.</v>

639
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 2>I just generally do.</v>

640
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.400
<v Speaker 2>That's my philosophical view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like any,</v>

641
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.513
<v Speaker 2>anything else I own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should be free to do with it as I </v>

642
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:09.450
<v Speaker 2>wish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

643
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't say there shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations I suited in.</v>

644
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you'll love this.</v>

645
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:19.340
<v Speaker 2>So the RNC had a lawsuit and that I took</v>
<v Speaker 2>over when I became chairman to,</v>

646
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.213
<v Speaker 2>to basically peel back on mccain fine </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal because Mccain Feingold took away </v>

647
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:29.490
<v Speaker 2>from the parties the ability to raise </v>
<v Speaker 2>the money.</v>

648
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.633
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they created this system that we </v>

649
00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:33.174
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course there was a companion </v>

650
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>

651
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:38.210
<v Speaker 2>It was put more money in now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

652
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 2>What was the companion lawsuit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone Supreme Court rejected my lawsuit</v>

653
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.740
<v Speaker 2>and picked up citizens united.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

654
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

655
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:49.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so citizens united was the,</v>

656
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.243
<v Speaker 2>it was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They decided to take over the one that </v>

657
00:29:51.731 --> 00:29:56.731
<v Speaker 2>will be given the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow donors to give untold sums as they</v>

658
00:29:56.741 --> 00:29:57.574
<v Speaker 2>used to to the state parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the national parties and the state </v>

659
00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:01.204
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>

660
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:02.523
<v Speaker 2>And they decided to go down this road </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you could set up these five slash </v>

661
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.703
<v Speaker 2>27,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we're now living through is a </v>

662
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:08.830
<v Speaker 2>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to get to that in just a sec.</v>

663
00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 2>But I think everyone wants to know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much does the money,</v>

664
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 2>how much influence does it actually get </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

665
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:17.860
<v Speaker 2>So someone writes a $38,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>check or someone writes the shrimp.</v>

666
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really what,</v>

667
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.670
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you running?</v>

668
00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well with the part,</v>

669
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>separating the party from the candidate.</v>

670
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 2>When you write a check to the R and C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we going to take care of you.</v>

671
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what we do.</v>

672
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does that mean?</v>

673
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.530
<v Speaker 2>When you call up and want to talk to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chairman?</v>

674
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.370
<v Speaker 2>You get to talk to the chairman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

675
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you don't bring issues to me because</v>

676
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 2>we're political.</v>

677
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.970
<v Speaker 2>We're not policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can.</v>

678
00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:43.804
<v Speaker 2>And some do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've got buckets of ideas that </v>

679
00:30:47.741 --> 00:30:48.580
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

680
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:50.020
<v Speaker 2>I think we should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine,</v>

681
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.700
<v Speaker 2>but that's a separate way to operate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

682
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 2>that's all political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

683
00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:56.340
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

684
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.490
<v Speaker 2>it's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

685
00:30:57.491 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wine,</v>

686
00:30:58.421 --> 00:30:59.254
<v Speaker 2>you dine you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take you out and we do big </v>

687
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 2>fundraisers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do small fundraisers,</v>

688
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 2>we're in your home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that part of that.</v>

689
00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:09.580
<v Speaker 2>And of course the access you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you have conviction,</v>

690
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:11.530
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be taken care of because</v>

691
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:13.420
<v Speaker 2>you're a major donor to the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

692
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.180
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be invited to the suite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get a chance to meet the</v>

693
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:17.950
<v Speaker 2>candidates fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you know the nominees,</v>

694
00:31:17.951 --> 00:31:20.650
<v Speaker 2>family and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do.</v>

695
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:21.603
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing that since the days of </v>

696
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson and Washington and all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

697
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.790
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's not unusual.</v>

698
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.373
<v Speaker 2>What's changed now is this dynamic where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have organizations that can be </v>

699
00:31:34.781 --> 00:31:37.430
<v Speaker 2>created that extensively don't talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the candidate.</v>

700
00:31:37.431 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which we know is complete bullshit,</v>

701
00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:39.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

702
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

703
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.300
<v Speaker 2>you know everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

704
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.163
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

705
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.240
<v Speaker 2>my former chief of staff is now the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my Super Pac.</v>

706
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 2>You don't think I'm talking to this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point.</v>

707
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.770
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll,</v>

708
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:52.643
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go with the lie will go with the </v>

709
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:56.520
<v Speaker 2>fiction that it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

710
00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:00.060
<v Speaker 2>what it does do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

711
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to be honest with everyone.</v>

712
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:02.704
<v Speaker 2>I'm still evolving in a way on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject because of how I view money </v>

713
00:32:06.881 --> 00:32:08.570
<v Speaker 2>generally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

714
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.770
<v Speaker 2>but money in politics and I see what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is doing is making it harder.</v>

715
00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:14.764
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is becoming more of a distraction at </v>

716
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:20.500
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a Rupert Murdoch or um,</v>

717
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some other big liberal or conservative </v>

718
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.370
<v Speaker 2>donor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get one vote,</v>

719
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you get one vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

720
00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.720
<v Speaker 2>you don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

721
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.593
<v Speaker 2>38,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>votes because you wrote a check for </v>

722
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:35.650
<v Speaker 2>$30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get one vote,</v>

723
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:36.484
<v Speaker 2>but now you can put a lot of money to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put a lot of ads on Fox or CNN or MSNBC </v>

724
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 2>that influence a lot of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

725
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about that.</v>

726
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.493
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you really influenced by political </v>

727
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:49.470
<v Speaker 2>ads anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

728
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:50.623
<v Speaker 2>if you saw an ad tearing him down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was a candidate for office and </v>

729
00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:55.270
<v Speaker 2>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 2>he hates puppies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

731
00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:58.483
<v Speaker 2>do you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really walk away from that </v>

732
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.950
<v Speaker 2>thinking he hates puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

733
00:33:01.951 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandmother didn't work and she goes,</v>

734
00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.450
<v Speaker 2>that's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

735
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

736
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.590
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

737
00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 2>and Willie Horton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

738
00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 2>it was originally a Democrat and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary,</v>

739
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:17.130
<v Speaker 2>so we won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't have that whole,</v>

740
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole nother discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought they'd like to put that on our</v>

741
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:20.590
<v Speaker 2>doorstep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let's,</v>

742
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 2>let's go to the origins of the Willie </v>
<v Speaker 2>Horton ad.</v>

743
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

744
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.460
<v Speaker 2>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>

745
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.420
<v Speaker 2>So what does that say about us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that say about you,</v>

746
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:33.254
<v Speaker 2>the consumer?</v>

747
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:33.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

748
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess my point is this is the ying and</v>

749
00:33:37.581 --> 00:33:38.414
<v Speaker 2>the Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the political class takes advantage </v>

750
00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:41.054
<v Speaker 2>of it as much as they can because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>know a negative ad is going to work no </v>

751
00:33:44.451 --> 00:33:47.270
<v Speaker 2>matter how much you protest against it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how much you hate it,</v>

752
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 2>you're going to sit there like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

753
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Did you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see that?</v>

754
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:51.794
<v Speaker 2>And now today you're going to tweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and you're gonna you're gonna </v>

755
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:56.780
<v Speaker 2>send it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they know that they play to that.</v>

756
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

757
00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

758
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.723
<v Speaker 2>And the money does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I tried to do as chairman and we </v>

759
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:08.660
<v Speaker 2>were moderately successful in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle in 2012,</v>

760
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.553
<v Speaker 2>but we set it up in my term in 20 2009 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 10 was I saw down the road that </v>

761
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:16.514
<v Speaker 2>money was going to be an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly after the Supreme Court </v>

762
00:34:18.351 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 2>rejected my case and took citizens </v>
<v Speaker 2>united.</v>

763
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.133
<v Speaker 2>So we wanted to design a system so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could actually participate without </v>

764
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:27.020
<v Speaker 2>necessarily having to have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

765
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.930
<v Speaker 2>And we saw that with Newt Gingrich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick Santorum,</v>

766
00:34:29.931 --> 00:34:30.764
<v Speaker 2>and a number of candidates in the 2012 </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle who didn't have Mitt Romney's </v>

767
00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.453
<v Speaker 2>bankroll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because of the way the system was </v>

768
00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:37.424
<v Speaker 2>designed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had time to get their idea out </v>

769
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:40.724
<v Speaker 2>there and those ideas began to resonate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's when the money came to them </v>

770
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.463
<v Speaker 2>after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is this dynamic that that you </v>

771
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:51.680
<v Speaker 2>can play around with right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I will argue and agree with you,</v>

772
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.514
<v Speaker 2>it's distorted and there needs to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reassessment of how we use money in </v>

773
00:34:58.101 --> 00:34:59.080
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

774
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:04.090
<v Speaker 2>and right now I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's used poorly because it's just way,</v>

775
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:06.530
<v Speaker 2>way too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So last question about,</v>

776
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.393
<v Speaker 2>about money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think both parties treated the </v>

777
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:10.070
<v Speaker 2>same?</v>

778
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this may be just there.</v>

779
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

780
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.550
<v Speaker 2>that the Koch brothers run the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican Party.</v>

781
00:35:16.551 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 2>There's more of these evil Mr Burns guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are running the party more than say</v>

782
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:21.671
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

783
00:35:21.671 --> 00:35:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer that it's equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money did Hollywood,</v>

784
00:35:25.431 --> 00:35:26.264
<v Speaker 2>how much money did the unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much money did individual wealthy </v>

785
00:35:29.481 --> 00:35:33.020
<v Speaker 2>donors give Barack Obama into Rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama?</v>

786
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.423
<v Speaker 2>Who as a US senator was up on the Senate</v>
<v Speaker 2>floor beating the hell out of </v>

787
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Republicans over campaign finance </v>
<v Speaker 2>reform,</v>

788
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.180
<v Speaker 2>talking all this smack about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

789
00:35:44.181 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the public money until he got a big</v>

790
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 2>ass check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden when it was,</v>

791
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.300
<v Speaker 2>when it came time to make that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did his campaign decided to do?</v>

792
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 2>They didn't take public money in 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Mccain did.</v>

793
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.370
<v Speaker 2>What did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The suit,</v>

794
00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:00.960
<v Speaker 2>they took all the Super Pac money.</v>

795
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.460
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they weren't super pacs,</v>

796
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.410
<v Speaker 2>they took all that money out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>

797
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.390
<v Speaker 2>They took all that money off of Wall </v>
<v Speaker 2>Street.</v>

798
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:07.343
<v Speaker 2>So don't talk to me about money in </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican politics and I'm not talking </v>

799
00:36:09.931 --> 00:36:13.110
<v Speaker 2>about money and the political system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

800
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.810
<v Speaker 2>that's the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because both sides love it.</v>

801
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Both sides suck at that teeth every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single day,</v>

802
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.400
<v Speaker 2>politically and maybe otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

803
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.530
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the reality that we're now having</v>

804
00:36:28.531 --> 00:36:29.940
<v Speaker 2>to live with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

805
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about big money.</v>

806
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:37.641
<v Speaker 2>It's just now manifesting itself in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different form because for 40 years with</v>

807
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:40.830
<v Speaker 2>the unions and Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're backing Democrats.</v>

808
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Republicans weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

809
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have all these big players the</v>

810
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:46.164
<v Speaker 2>way we do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have the Koch brothers back </v>

811
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:48.371
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

812
00:36:48.371 --> 00:36:49.204
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ronald Reagan's Day or in the 19 </v>

813
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:54.630
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the dynamic has changed a little bit.</v>

814
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was actually changed a lot.</v>

815
00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:57.953
<v Speaker 2>But the thread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meme is the same and that is money </v>

816
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:02.124
<v Speaker 2>still plays a role in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question that we need to ask </v>

817
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:05.214
<v Speaker 2>ourselves again in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in setting up our scales of priorities </v>

818
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 2>is how do we prioritize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prioritize its role,</v>

819
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.780
<v Speaker 2>because if you're going to go to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>

820
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public financing system,</v>

821
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.983
<v Speaker 2>then you need to account for races that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in markets like this market here in </v>

822
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:21.954
<v Speaker 2>la that is damned expensive versus a </v>
<v Speaker 2>market in Utah or a market in southwest </v>

823
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.730
<v Speaker 2>corner of South Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this an example of where Obama really</v>

824
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:33.564
<v Speaker 2>has dropped the ball?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because even just yesterday he went to </v>

825
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Oregon where the shooting was a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>days ago.</v>

826
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.140
<v Speaker 2>And do you guys know where he went?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right after that?</v>

827
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.540
<v Speaker 2>He went to a fundraiser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

828
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>

829
00:37:44.491 --> 00:37:47.590
<v Speaker 2>He was almost after every national </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy goes to a fundraising.</v>

830
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.453
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who scheduling this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a second term president with </v>

831
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:54.090
<v Speaker 2>only a year left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who after this horrific tragedy,</v>

832
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.983
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's raised in one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's raised the money for I guess for </v>

833
00:37:56.851 --> 00:37:57.684
<v Speaker 2>the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

834
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Debbie says they're broke.</v>

835
00:38:00.451 --> 00:38:01.284
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the most emblematic thing of </v>

836
00:38:04.771 --> 00:38:05.604
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That even a two term president on his </v>

837
00:38:07.111 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Speaker 2>way out goes to a tragedy and then at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day,</v>

838
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:13.380
<v Speaker 2>his day was spent raising money and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even for himself.</v>

839
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:15.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

840
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:15.924
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is something that really </v>

841
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:21.780
<v Speaker 2>sticks in the craw of a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you,</v>

842
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:22.614
<v Speaker 2>is as many conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians are as annoyed about that </v>

843
00:38:26.581 --> 00:38:29.490
<v Speaker 2>as are liberals and progressives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it is,</v>

844
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:30.324
<v Speaker 2>it is an American phenomenon that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>invest so much of our politics and </v>

845
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 2>having money to do politics.</v>

846
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the way politics is </v>

847
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:46.051
<v Speaker 2>executed around the globe that come </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere near what we spend,</v>

848
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

849
00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.673
<v Speaker 2>to elect someone to office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about how much money a </v>

850
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 2>candidate running for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with the candidate,</v>

851
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday in New Hampshire.</v>

852
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at a congressional race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask them how much it's going to run,</v>

853
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.593
<v Speaker 2>how much it's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost them in New Hampshire for </v>

854
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.473
<v Speaker 2>$2,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New Hampshire in New Hampshire for a </v>

855
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:10.210
<v Speaker 2>job that pays $170,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

856
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:11.643
<v Speaker 2>When I ran for the US Senate in 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my race was the most expensive race in </v>

857
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:19.500
<v Speaker 2>the state of Maryland up to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

858
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for federal office.</v>

859
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.040
<v Speaker 2>And I raised $10,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the US Senate races today for 2000,</v>

860
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:29.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16.</v>

861
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.113
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that race is now about a 15 to </v>

862
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 2>$20,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

863
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

864
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.570
<v Speaker 2>And no one stops to ask the question to </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer the question,</v>

865
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:42.790
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that expensive?</v>

866
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're right it.</v>

867
00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.760
<v Speaker 2>And they need to continue to ask it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

868
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is having a,</v>

869
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very downward,</v>

870
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 2>a depressive effect on our politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

871
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.081
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

872
00:39:57.081 --> 00:39:59.800
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it brings out the cynicism and all of us</v>

873
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:00.963
<v Speaker 2>because you just see a very small group </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who are getting to play and </v>

874
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:06.663
<v Speaker 2>you're the one paying the taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the one trying to make it from </v>

875
00:40:09.191 --> 00:40:11.860
<v Speaker 2>paycheck to paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the one who's trying to deal with</v>

876
00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:16.510
<v Speaker 2>all this crap that spews out of state </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitals and in federal government.</v>

877
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.913
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just feel that your access is </v>

878
00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:20.824
<v Speaker 2>somehow limited and cut off and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>American should feel that way in my </v>

879
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

880
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough about money,</v>

881
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.900
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>

882
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 2>It's important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

883
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 2>and we can talk about it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>

884
00:40:31.361 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 2>It is important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

885
00:40:32.201 --> 00:40:35.260
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things I don't you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me how you get it out of the game.</v>

886
00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.420
<v Speaker 2>How do you get out of the game at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point?</v>

887
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Because under the current rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the current rules,</v>

888
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:45.361
<v Speaker 2>because as long as you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizens united a out there where you,</v>

889
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:48.010
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you can get together and decided</v>

890
00:40:48.011 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 2>we were going to form a PAC and it may </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be for candidate a or candidate b.</v>

891
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:53.643
<v Speaker 2>You just want to form a PAC and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to play and you're going to go to </v>

892
00:40:56.201 --> 00:40:57.034
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can now raise untold millions of </v>

893
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.440
<v Speaker 2>dollars and we don't need to know who </v>
<v Speaker 2>any one of you are.</v>

894
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:04.803
<v Speaker 2>You can stroke a check for $10,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and your name will never show </v>

895
00:41:08.501 --> 00:41:13.240
<v Speaker 2>up on any report in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we really want that system?</v>

896
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I believe very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

897
00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:18.490
<v Speaker 2>going back to my and we can move on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to my central argument,</v>

898
00:41:18.491 --> 00:41:22.060
<v Speaker 2>money his property so I can do with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>property whatever I want,</v>

899
00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

900
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 2>So if I want to write your campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a $10,000,000</v>

901
00:41:24.581 --> 00:41:25.450
<v Speaker 2>check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

902
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I should be allowed to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the caveat.</v>

903
00:41:28.001 --> 00:41:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Here's the catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The day I ride it,</v>

904
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.560
<v Speaker 2>the next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next hour,</v>

905
00:41:32.561 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 2>the next it is fully disclosed period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My name,</v>

906
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 2>what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount,</v>

907
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.663
<v Speaker 2>the nature of my business so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone in the universe knows who's </v>

908
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 2>giving to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that puts the onus on you,</v>

909
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:47.743
<v Speaker 2>the politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you want to be associated </v>

910
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:53.390
<v Speaker 2>with my money and all that comes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

911
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.430
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll take it.</v>

912
00:41:55.790 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what you want and that will have a</v>

913
00:42:00.111 --> 00:42:00.944
<v Speaker 2>chilling effect because right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know that I'm doing </v>

914
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:09.131
<v Speaker 2>something that you know harms the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment or otherwise is a negative,</v>

915
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.780
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one in the universe will ever know it</v>

916
00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.730
<v Speaker 2>except you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you write the check,</v>

917
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.440
<v Speaker 2>when you get it,</v>

918
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.273
<v Speaker 1>the check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that politicians like </v>

919
00:42:19.181 --> 00:42:20.980
<v Speaker 1>the plausible deniability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they do.</v>

920
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:21.791
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

921
00:42:21.791 --> 00:42:23.650
<v Speaker 1>so moving away from money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk about foreign policy a</v>

922
00:42:23.651 --> 00:42:26.830
<v Speaker 1>little bit because to me it should be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>republican.</v>

923
00:42:26.831 --> 00:42:30.320
<v Speaker 1>This should be a goto republican issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're in a freaking mess right now.</v>

924
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the American public really</v>

925
00:42:32.771 --> 00:42:36.660
<v Speaker 1>realizes what public initiatives that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stronger,</v>

926
00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the executive branch sets the foreign </v>

927
00:42:38.381 --> 00:42:39.710
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is this of.</v>

928
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.593
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that Republicans are </v>

929
00:42:42.611 --> 00:42:44.950
<v Speaker 1>stronger and foreign policy and we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a meltdown,</v>

930
00:42:44.951 --> 00:42:46.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we gave that up a while ago.</v>

931
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.273
<v Speaker 1>Clearly we gave that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gave that position up a while ago </v>

932
00:42:51.341 --> 00:42:53.710
<v Speaker 1>when we started making some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

933
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.800
<v Speaker 1>some really boneheaded decisions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how we engage boneheaded,</v>

934
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it was just,</v>

935
00:43:00.941 --> 00:43:01.320
<v Speaker 1>it's just</v>

936
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.490
<v Speaker 2>bad policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

937
00:43:02.491 --> 00:43:04.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't do nation building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

938
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:05.483
<v Speaker 2>no super power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since time began has been successful at </v>

939
00:43:08.941 --> 00:43:10.680
<v Speaker 2>nation building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It always,</v>

940
00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:11.514
<v Speaker 2>it always collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some point it falls down around your </v>

941
00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:14.290
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

942
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.900
<v Speaker 1>So where do you fall down on everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on in the Middle East?</v>

943
00:43:16.901 --> 00:43:18.220
<v Speaker 1>We tried to nation build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

944
00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:20.860
<v Speaker 1>We know we went to the wrong war for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong reasons.</v>

945
00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that fair to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also mentioned,</v>

946
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now because of that Iraq,</v>

947
00:43:26.141 --> 00:43:28.500
<v Speaker 1>but especially Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not functioning states in,</v>

948
00:43:28.501 --> 00:43:29.334
<v Speaker 1>in any way that we define a state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at it in two parts and the </v>

949
00:43:32.741 --> 00:43:33.360
<v Speaker 1>first one,</v>

950
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.350
<v Speaker 2>we all know the history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know how we got here.</v>

951
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.150
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

952
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.013
<v Speaker 2>that's stipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know how we got here and I think </v>

953
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:42.344
<v Speaker 2>generally everyone and including a </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates now running for president on </v>

954
00:43:46.851 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 2>the gop side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some begrudgingly,</v>

955
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:50.504
<v Speaker 2>some less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So admit that we've got here the wrong </v>

956
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:53.661
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

957
00:43:53.661 --> 00:43:57.740
<v Speaker 2>So we're in a bad space for the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

958
00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the tests of this time,</v>

959
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how do we go forward and how do we,</v>

960
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:15.340
<v Speaker 2>what do we learn from the mistake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then how do we not make it again,</v>

961
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:17.263
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we position the United States </v>

962
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 2>visa vi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

963
00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:27.340
<v Speaker 2>are our allies like Israel and Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>

964
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.863
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you represent a to two opposing </v>

965
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 2>problems for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the U,</v>

966
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:36.294
<v Speaker 2>s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>m,</v>

967
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.530
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our enemies like Iran,</v>

968
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.693
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really don't want to use that </v>

969
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.850
<v Speaker 2>term because that's a little strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

970
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a little strong because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's there,</v>

971
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:49.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so</v>

972
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:54.040
<v Speaker 1>that kind of give them $150 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that</v>

973
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.380
<v Speaker 2>kind of relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

974
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:57.351
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

975
00:44:57.351 --> 00:44:58.184
<v Speaker 2>and the strategic relationship which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to have with Russia and China who </v>

976
00:45:01.141 --> 00:45:04.410
<v Speaker 2>are big players in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so are the French,</v>

977
00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:07.590
<v Speaker 2>the Brits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

978
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.500
<v Speaker 1>where does that leave us as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a nation?</v>

979
00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems to me we go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we try something,</v>

980
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:15.840
<v Speaker 1>we always screw it up and now we leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we see what that does.</v>

981
00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a real mess there and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>created it.</v>

982
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:19.164
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guilt sort of associated with </v>

983
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 1>the Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We feel like we have to do something and</v>

984
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:26.460
<v Speaker 1>yet we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what we do,</v>

985
00:45:26.461 --> 00:45:28.900
<v Speaker 1>we somehow make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now Russia is jumping in and,</v>

986
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.813
<v Speaker 1>and reassess.</v>

987
00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.391
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

988
00:45:30.391 --> 00:45:30.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

989
00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:32.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can argue the point,</v>

990
00:45:32.671 --> 00:45:33.504
<v Speaker 2>but I think there are enough examples of</v>
<v Speaker 2>either hesitation by this </v>

991
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.590
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Obama Administration,</v>

992
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:42.630
<v Speaker 2>a reticence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

993
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:47.631
<v Speaker 2>or even just a lack of unawareness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they even alluded to just recently</v>

994
00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

995
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:51.683
<v Speaker 2>the maneuvers of Russia when you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>State Department officials off the </v>

996
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:58.690
<v Speaker 2>record saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't see this coming due.</v>

997
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.560
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to see this coming.</v>

998
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:02.290
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

999
00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.200
<v Speaker 1>or they call them jv called.</v>

1000
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you what I think this goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to.</v>

1001
00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:12.431
<v Speaker 2>This goes back to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not to the 19 seventies in</v>

1002
00:46:12.591 --> 00:46:14.220
<v Speaker 2>my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1003
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.240
<v Speaker 2>when the church committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1004
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.570
<v Speaker 2>and the Carter administration sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>came to this community,</v>

1005
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.600
<v Speaker 2>a conclusion that our intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations were somehow bad.</v>

1006
00:46:25.911 --> 00:46:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Now they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1007
00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.430
<v Speaker 2>CIA and all those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1008
00:46:28.431 --> 00:46:31.550
<v Speaker 2>they had their fingers in some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>pots and doing some crazy things.</v>

1009
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.400
<v Speaker 2>We got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think what we,</v>

1010
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:37.130
<v Speaker 2>what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we have seen over time,</v>

1011
00:46:37.131 --> 00:46:39.620
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Iran Contra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it is a,</v>

1012
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:41.720
<v Speaker 2>what we're seeing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1013
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.750
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1014
00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.740
<v Speaker 2>in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1015
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.823
<v Speaker 2>is a lack of intelligence on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lack of ability to actually know what </v>

1016
00:46:50.871 --> 00:46:51.704
<v Speaker 2>the hell is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't just mean know who the bad </v>

1017
00:46:55.941 --> 00:46:57.950
<v Speaker 2>players are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but know what,</v>

1018
00:46:57.951 --> 00:46:59.330
<v Speaker 2>nook and cranny they're in.</v>

1019
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:04.460
<v Speaker 2>No know what their favorite cafe is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what their favorite coffee or Latte</v>

1020
00:47:04.461 --> 00:47:05.294
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1021
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.153
<v Speaker 2>know who their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just that level of detail that </v>

1022
00:47:09.051 --> 00:47:09.884
<v Speaker 2>was so much a part of the Cold War in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of how the US and Russia sort of </v>

1023
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:15.103
<v Speaker 2>worked off of each other and knew what </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on and they were so effective </v>

1024
00:47:19.101 --> 00:47:21.650
<v Speaker 2>at it that they created a effectively a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stalemate.</v>

1025
00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who's fault is that?</v>

1026
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.260
<v Speaker 2>That we don't have that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1027
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1028
00:47:25.191 --> 00:47:26.024
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of political leadership that sort of </v>

1029
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 2>overreacted to bad things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1030
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these institutions get into.</v>

1031
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:35.644
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1032
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.390
<v Speaker 2>and do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1033
00:47:37.391 --> 00:47:40.450
<v Speaker 2>government is about overreaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about reaction.</v>

1034
00:47:40.451 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a proactive entity,</v>

1035
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 2>they just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think they sit around and say,</v>

1036
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:45.303
<v Speaker 2>so listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we actually solve a problem </v>

1037
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:47.500
<v Speaker 2>before it starts?</v>

1038
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 2>That's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what they do.</v>

1039
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1040
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:56.770
<v Speaker 2>a new town happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a columbine happens,</v>

1041
00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1042
00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.333
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1043
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.980
<v Speaker 2>a Freddie gray happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things happen.</v>

1044
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:03.814
<v Speaker 2>And then the government wants to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're now we're going to come here and </v>

1045
00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fix this for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>

1046
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:09.064
<v Speaker 2>we got this now actually now just step </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and I'll just let the people on the </v>

1047
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:14.330
<v Speaker 2>ground deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

1048
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit of that where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>overreact and they overreact in a way in</v>

1049
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 2>which they actually wind up making it </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

1050
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.573
<v Speaker 2>And in the process of overreacting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they begin to penalize the players in a </v>

1051
00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:29.140
<v Speaker 2>way that prevents them from doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything constructive later on.</v>

1052
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Because now we're going to cut your </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding for this.</v>

1053
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.830
<v Speaker 2>We're going to bring you in for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these here.</v>

1054
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.590
<v Speaker 2>If they just did day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>week to week,</v>

1055
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 2>month to month oversight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have committees called oversight.</v>

1056
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Do they meet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they actually do oversight?</v>

1057
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Whose oversight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing this on an ongoing basis</v>

1058
00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.720
<v Speaker 2>and you're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supporting and guiding those,</v>

1059
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:53.583
<v Speaker 2>those intelligence organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the stuff that we've gotten </v>

1060
00:48:56.531 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 2>ourselves into over the last 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years,</v>

1061
00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.973
<v Speaker 2>some of that could have been avoided </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we would have had the </v>

1062
00:49:02.171 --> 00:49:04.300
<v Speaker 2>intelligence to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1063
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it this way.</v>

1064
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:06.963
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times have we seen in the </v>

1065
00:49:08.141 --> 00:49:12.610
<v Speaker 2>political process when you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>count right on something or you,</v>

1066
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.970
<v Speaker 2>you've misidentified something or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed brand,</v>

1067
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.580
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no consequences from that.</v>

1068
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.593
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the speaker didn't get that vote </v>

1069
00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:23.590
<v Speaker 2>because the whip didn't count it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1070
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got that.</v>

1071
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.310
<v Speaker 2>But when you're out in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>

1072
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.340
<v Speaker 2>when you're in a situation like Bengazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1073
00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.940
<v Speaker 2>where you have cables from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the people in the field saying,</v>

1074
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:34.774
<v Speaker 2>we need the support and the folks in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington want to have a meeting about </v>

1075
00:49:39.281 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1076
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:42.220
<v Speaker 2>That's where the things began to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1077
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 2>and so there's this idea of having an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ongoing,</v>

1078
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.533
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accountable oversight process in which </v>

1079
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:51.490
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in the moment,</v>

1080
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 2>real time with what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think begins to alleviate the pressure</v>

1081
00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.930
<v Speaker 2>on the executive branch and even the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress,</v>

1082
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put itself in a position where,</v>

1083
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about sending in troops </v>

1084
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:04.960
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1085
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:07.270
<v Speaker 2>ratcheting up all this spending on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1086
00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in reaction to something that someone </v>

1087
00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:11.310
<v Speaker 2>else has done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1088
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not always playing catch up.</v>

1089
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I think we're playing catch up and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more complicated.</v>

1090
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I know and there's a lot more to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1091
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>

1092
00:50:20.021 --> 00:50:20.854
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned over the years in </v>

1093
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Washington and certain watching some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

1094
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.500
<v Speaker 2>it's always the simple stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1095
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:27.334
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>

1096
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:28.183
<v Speaker 2>the things that you don't think are </v>
<v Speaker 2>important or the things that you just </v>

1097
00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 2>kind of got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1098
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 2>why are we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would we do that?</v>

1099
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing you should do to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bigger problem later on.</v>

1100
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's become like my main </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1101
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:40.583
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were sitting on the panel on real </v>

1102
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:48.671
<v Speaker 1>time with Bill Maher when Sam Harris who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on with Ben Affleck,</v>

1103
00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming most of you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably familiar with what happened,</v>

1104
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:53.474
<v Speaker 1>but basically that was so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you saw to me what became a </v>

1105
00:50:57.381 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 1>seminal moment and a split in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the liberals between the progressives</v>

1106
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.640
<v Speaker 1>and what I consider the true liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where I fall,</v>

1107
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.713
<v Speaker 1>but basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically a Sam Harris said a few </v>

1108
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 1>things about the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

1109
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.133
<v Speaker 2>Harris was making a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intellectual argument based in </v>

1110
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.833
<v Speaker 2>research based deal poles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was quoting tools and things like </v>

1111
00:51:21.331 --> 00:51:22.550
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1112
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.360
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the jump off point.</v>

1113
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ben was making,</v>

1114
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1115
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.620
<v Speaker 2>a progressive argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1116
00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.483
<v Speaker 2>that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to the point I was making </v>

1117
00:51:34.681 --> 00:51:35.514
<v Speaker 2>before about people and how those pupils</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all those numbers actually </v>

1118
00:51:41.521 --> 00:51:45.660
<v Speaker 2>translated into people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you start talking about people,</v>

1119
00:51:45.661 --> 00:51:49.260
<v Speaker 2>then you're talking about attitudes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptions and all of that.</v>

1120
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.990
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very interesting dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought.</v>

1121
00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:54.843
<v Speaker 1>So for the people that didn't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically Sam quoted a couple poles and </v>

1122
00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:59.560
<v Speaker 1>then immediately been athletic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He screamed,</v>

1123
00:51:59.561 --> 00:52:00.790
<v Speaker 1>that's gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's racist,</v>

1124
00:52:00.791 --> 00:52:01.624
<v Speaker 1>that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that changes the dynamic the </v>

1125
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.490
<v Speaker 1>next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every media outlet in the question was,</v>

1126
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Affleck Calls Bill Maher and Sam </v>

1127
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:10.783
<v Speaker 1>Harris Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the onus was on them to prove </v>

1128
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that they weren't racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for you,</v>

1129
00:52:14.201 --> 00:52:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I assume when someone throws around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1130
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:17.530
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bigot,</v>

1131
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I assume you don't take those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>lightly.</v>

1132
00:52:19.241 --> 00:52:21.220
<v Speaker 1>What was it like to be sitting there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the midst of that?</v>

1133
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Especially because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you weren't even.</v>

1134
00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:25.360
<v Speaker 1>You guys weren't even supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the conversation,</v>

1135
00:52:25.361 --> 00:52:26.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1136
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:26.933
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1137
00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:29.070
<v Speaker 2>that was the bill and Sam moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And I saw Ben Lean in and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all hell,</v>

1139
00:52:33.311 --> 00:52:34.144
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he started and I've learned </v>

1140
00:52:38.411 --> 00:52:41.860
<v Speaker 2>over these years that when two liberals </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going at it,</v>

1141
00:52:41.861 --> 00:52:46.861
<v Speaker 2>there's no need for the conservative to </v>
<v Speaker 2>opine or contribute in any way.</v>

1142
00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:52.020
<v Speaker 2>And just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

1143
00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.730
<v Speaker 2>you guys work that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me know.</v>

1144
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:59.560
<v Speaker 2>But what is your takeaway from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>takeaway from it was,</v>

1145
00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I understand what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I did speak,</v>

1146
00:53:01.691 --> 00:53:02.524
<v Speaker 2>what I was trying when I try to get on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the table was you're both right and </v>

1147
00:53:06.551 --> 00:53:07.384
<v Speaker 2>you're both reflecting exactly what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in the broader population that </v>

1148
00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.020
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see these,</v>

1149
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.820
<v Speaker 2>these numbers that reflect some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some events or what's going on.</v>

1150
00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at extreme actions by an extreme</v>

1151
00:53:24.551 --> 00:53:25.384
<v Speaker 2>group of and we pejoratively projected </v>
<v Speaker 2>over everybody in that particular class </v>

1152
00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:31.920
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

1153
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:32.753
<v Speaker 2>So you had this dynamic even though you </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked that Sam wasn't really doing the </v>

1154
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:37.880
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1155
00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 2>that the know and Sam was not doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sandwiches,</v>

1156
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just looking at these are the numbers,</v>

1157
00:53:43.801 --> 00:53:46.410
<v Speaker 2>this is what this is reflecting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what people are saying,</v>

1158
00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:47.910
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what the poll says.</v>

1159
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is again,</v>

1160
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 2>a speaks to the dynamic of our politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have we immediately go to the personal.</v>

1161
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.030
<v Speaker 2>It became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became intensely personal.</v>

1162
00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 2>When you label the charge and you throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the charge,</v>

1163
00:53:59.821 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>you're racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you even infer that,</v>

1164
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 2>that that's an intensely personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

1165
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:10.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm in that conversation in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes my way,</v>

1166
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.030
<v Speaker 2>all bets are off because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking me now,</v>

1167
00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 2>this is one on one a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been called an uncle Tom.</v>

1168
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I've had oreo cookies thrown at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1169
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I've gone through this.</v>

1170
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:24.710
<v Speaker 2>I know what this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ugliness in politics is about,</v>

1171
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:27.880
<v Speaker 2>and even more broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1172
00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:31.860
<v Speaker 2>and so I thought Sam did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did very well,</v>

1173
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:33.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold a,</v>

1174
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:37.500
<v Speaker 2>to hold it and keep it from moving into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the intensely personal.</v>

1175
00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:42.501
<v Speaker 2>But Ben was intensely personal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because he cared passionately.</v>

1176
00:54:42.601 --> 00:54:46.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's speaks to you can have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that passion,</v>

1177
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:47.640
<v Speaker 2>but you need to know where the limits </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1178
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:48.923
<v Speaker 2>You need to know where the limits are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation and you need to know </v>

1179
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:55.640
<v Speaker 2>how to conduct that passion in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your point is,</v>

1180
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 2>it's not lost because it is still an I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought he made a valid point.</v>

1181
00:54:59.461 --> 00:55:00.294
<v Speaker 2>And we're so because we don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>project this pejorative view about a </v>

1182
00:55:04.021 --> 00:55:06.060
<v Speaker 2>race of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a class of people,</v>

1183
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 2>about any individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1184
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:08.634
<v Speaker 2>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you certainly don't want to use the </v>

1185
00:55:10.621 --> 00:55:11.454
<v Speaker 2>test sticks.</v>

1186
00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.513
<v Speaker 2>And numbers to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take great exception to the fact that </v>

1187
00:55:15.601 --> 00:55:17.820
<v Speaker 2>whenever anyone starts talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>

1188
00:55:17.821 --> 00:55:18.654
<v Speaker 2>why do you immediately jumped to black?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the image that pops in your head </v>

1189
00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:23.304
<v Speaker 2>when someone mentions poverty in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country is the image of a black person </v>

1190
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.150
<v Speaker 2>when there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

1191
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.040
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about crime in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1192
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 2>the criminal element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1193
00:55:30.961 --> 00:55:33.300
<v Speaker 2>crime is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you jump to my community?</v>

1194
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw recently a,</v>

1195
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:39.310
<v Speaker 2>even on the welfare question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1196
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:43.770
<v Speaker 2>some members of Congress get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble because they were inferring that</v>

1197
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.730
<v Speaker 2>the folk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1198
00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna solve welfare by,</v>

1199
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:49.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working in the black.</v>

1200
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the majority of people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare in this country are white?</v>

1201
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Have you been to Appalachia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>

1202
00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 2>because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are hurting</v>

1203
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.023
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1204
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 2>They don't live in an urban inner city.</v>

1205
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1206
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.033
<v Speaker 2>Why is their pain and their suffering </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their poverty less important for </v>

1207
00:56:10.121 --> 00:56:10.954
<v Speaker 2>focus and emphasis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly when they're part of the </v>

1208
00:56:13.811 --> 00:56:15.760
<v Speaker 2>majority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of the danger.</v>

1209
00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:16.594
<v Speaker 2>That's the danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the danger when you start </v>

1210
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:19.383
<v Speaker 2>pejorative sizing and start speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a group of people in a in which </v>

1211
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.963
<v Speaker 2>you clearly don't know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about because you're not </v>

1212
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:27.994
<v Speaker 2>reflecting what's really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in one of the wealthiest black </v>

1213
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:32.044
<v Speaker 2>county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wealthiest black county in the </v>

1214
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

1215
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.213
<v Speaker 2>So when you start talking about poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different conversation </v>

1216
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 2>when you come to where I live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't paint that.</v>

1217
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 2>You can't use that brush the same way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you use it when you're talking about the</v>

1218
00:56:46.871 --> 00:56:47.704
<v Speaker 2>folks somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the problem people get into </v>

1219
00:56:50.231 --> 00:56:52.860
<v Speaker 2>when they start doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

1220
00:56:52.861 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 2>that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1221
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 2>stereotype conversation about white </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>

1222
00:56:58.001 --> 00:56:59.350
<v Speaker 2>black folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor folks,</v>

1223
00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:00.120
<v Speaker 2>rich folks.</v>

1224
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:00.840
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they,</v>

1225
00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:01.673
<v Speaker 2>they gave me the rafting here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So last thing I'm putting you on the </v>

1226
00:57:02.591 --> 00:57:03.424
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you jump back into politics </v>

1227
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:05.943
<v Speaker 2>because I've sat here with you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the reverse of what I saw with </v>

1228
00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Scott Walker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

1229
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:10.894
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you believe in what you're </v>

1230
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may not agree with you on everything,</v>

1231
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 2>but you get the system and I'll get back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1232
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:18.383
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like where I am right now because I </v>

1234
00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:21.394
<v Speaker 2>get to get up every day and have a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>cup of coffee and asked myself who </v>

1235
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:32.281
<v Speaker 2>should I piss off today and I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a meeting after I knew that.</v>

1236
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1237
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I kinda liked the space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the national dialogue.</v>

1238
00:57:40.181 --> 00:57:43.050
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a part of the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue as you are a.</v>

1239
00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:46.780
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good space right now is as long</v>

1240
00:57:46.781 --> 00:57:49.150
<v Speaker 2>as I'm able to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate MSNBC,</v>

1241
00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:53.460
<v Speaker 2>forgiving this conservative voice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to kind of come out and say,</v>

1242
00:57:53.461 --> 00:57:54.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my buddy Chris Matthews.</v>

1243
00:57:54.911 --> 00:57:55.421
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>

1244
00:57:55.421 --> 00:57:56.510
<v Speaker 2>hold on just a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I,</v>

1245
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.830
<v Speaker 2>can I talk now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I get it?</v>

1246
00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.553
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm speeding as much as it appears </v>

1247
00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 2>when he's yelling that I love hardball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great show.</v>

1248
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:06.634
<v Speaker 2>It's a great political discussion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a very smart guy and is very </v>

1249
00:58:09.461 --> 00:58:10.294
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent conversation and we need a </v>

1250
00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:13.510
<v Speaker 2>lot more of that in our politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1251
00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I hope you guys appreciate what I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1252
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:17.613
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
