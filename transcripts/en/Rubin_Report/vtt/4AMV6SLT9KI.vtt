1
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly it seems the entire country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the.</v>

2
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:10.180
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I guess it's our turn as well.</v>

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who are tuned to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wacky wild underside of the Internet,</v>

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>you know that the alt right has existed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of years now,</v>

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's only in the last few days that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream has started talking about</v>

6
00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:23.320
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last week,</v>

7
00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.154
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton attack me all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a big speech which lead to coverage </v>

8
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>in every newspaper and online outlet </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the globe.</v>

9
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Hillary blamed Breitbart.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>for mainstreaming racism,</v>

10
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>which she said was proven by trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace of the alt right.</v>

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.983
<v Speaker 1>CNN and Fox News both aired clips from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rubin report in which Milo </v>

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.173
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos talked about the alt right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining it as a counter culture </v>

13
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:49.924
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniting disaffected conservatives with </v>

14
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>mischievous Internet meme makers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the usual pundant.</v>

15
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:57.424
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly we're all experts on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alright even though they didn't know </v>

16
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>what it was while it was growing right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before their eyes.</v>

17
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>This whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our outrage culture always need some new</v>

18
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>outrage to be outraged about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once Hillary mentioned the alt right</v>

19
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:11.644
<v Speaker 1>by name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it meant the movement had officially </v>

20
00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:14.404
<v Speaker 1>arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Albright seems to take many </v>

21
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>different forms depending on who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to,</v>

22
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media and pretty much the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire left brand,</v>

23
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>the alt right as a white supremacists </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

24
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>rallying around Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their members hate blacks.</v>

25
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>They hate Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate Hispanics,</v>

26
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>and they want some sort of racially pure</v>
<v Speaker 1>country to stop white genocide.</v>

27
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.273
<v Speaker 1>Mainstream Republicans see the alt right</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a group of loud mouth defensive </v>

28
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:41.104
<v Speaker 1>racist who are tearing the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement apart by throwing away </v>

29
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 1>traditional conservative ideals like </v>
<v Speaker 1>small government and replacing them with</v>

30
00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:49.414
<v Speaker 1>a win at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Candidate other say the outright is a </v>

31
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.044
<v Speaker 1>grassroots movement born out of natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushback to are increasingly political </v>

32
00:01:57.311 --> 00:01:58.144
<v Speaker 1>correct society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you mix some of those </v>

33
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>explanations together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what the all or I really is,</v>

34
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>but you have to add one more thing.</v>

35
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>The Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alt right,</v>

36
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.273
<v Speaker 1>whatever version of it you claimed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>was created right here on the Internet </v>

37
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>and as something created by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

38
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>it is as amorphous as the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

39
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>What the alt right really is though is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>band of a meme,</v>

40
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:25.664
<v Speaker 1>posters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anamae avatars and twitter eggs vying </v>

41
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:29.504
<v Speaker 1>for attention from people in power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They posted Nazi means racist pictures </v>

42
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:34.694
<v Speaker 1>and offensive tweets with the express </v>
<v Speaker 1>intent of getting powerful people to </v>

43
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:40.010
<v Speaker 1>react,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respond,</v>

44
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.053
<v Speaker 1>and thus amplify their message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are keyboard warriors and </v>

45
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:45.044
<v Speaker 1>professional trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get attention from the sold </v>

46
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>out and corrupt media and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite that we have.</v>

47
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.123
<v Speaker 1>The real alright isn't about one </v>
<v Speaker 1>political ideology as much as it is a </v>

48
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:57.374
<v Speaker 1>loosely linked group of people using </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools of the Internet to upset the </v>

49
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

50
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:08.191
<v Speaker 1>in some ways this wrangling and mocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the establishment is exactly what the</v>

51
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Revolution was supposed to be.</v>

52
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>But while Hillary put Bernie's </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution on ice,</v>

53
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>she is now elevated the alright to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream status by giving a big speech</v>

54
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:18.394
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alright wants attention more than </v>

55
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>anything and they trolled her into </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving them exactly what they want.</v>

56
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.763
<v Speaker 1>Let me back up here for a sec because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to gloss over that whole </v>

57
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>white supremacist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hate the blacks hate the Jews.</v>

58
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Kick out the Hispanics thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This portion of the alt right absolutely</v>

59
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>does exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it on twitter every single day.</v>

60
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.103
<v Speaker 1>You can pause this video right now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>find thousands of images including Nazi </v>

61
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist characatures of minorities,</v>

62
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>and plenty more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do a quick search on twitter,</v>

63
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>a scan on reddit or a look at four Chan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see some pretty nasty stuff.</v>

64
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.843
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys know my policy on free </v>

65
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.874
<v Speaker 1>speech and free expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I choose to ignore these images and </v>

66
00:03:57.911 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>ideas rather than amplify them.</v>

67
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.963
<v Speaker 1>The real question though is do these </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly hateful racist means in tweets </v>

68
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Speaker 1>represent a real movement of hate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they designed just to get attention?</v>

69
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.403
<v Speaker 1>I think it's some combination of both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some true racist mixed with a bunch of </v>

70
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>people who just want to mess with those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empower.</v>

71
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>How many of each of them are there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea.</v>

72
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.323
<v Speaker 1>What we do know though is that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will very little real world </v>

73
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dwight's premises exist.</v>

74
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Black Jew and Hispanic haters exist.</v>

75
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do too.</v>

76
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Some people want to keep immigrants out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of racism.</v>

77
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.403
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people who make up the right </v>

78
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>aren't the ones with the power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

79
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>they are the ones trying to upset the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in power,</v>

80
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.103
<v Speaker 1>and as for Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has blacks and Jews and Hispanics on </v>

81
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:50.614
<v Speaker 1>his campaign staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean there aren't racists </v>

82
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:54.400
<v Speaker 1>supporters of trump.</v>

83
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.713
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are just as they're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist supporters of Hillary and </v>

84
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.714
<v Speaker 1>everyone else to ever run for president </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever trumps blunt language which has </v>

85
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.814
<v Speaker 1>attacked almost every group out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>often blurring the line between being </v>

86
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:12.571
<v Speaker 1>politically incorrect and truly hateful </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just an extension of the tactics that</v>

87
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 1>the alt right keyboard warriors are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing on their own.</v>

88
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the regressive left is more</v>

89
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>of a threat to our democracy than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

90
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.813
<v Speaker 1>The regressive left with its tactics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stifling debate and silencing critics </v>

91
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>has gained mainstream traction in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>media and in our universities.</v>

92
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.233
<v Speaker 1>These regressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not progressive ideas have become all </v>

93
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:38.674
<v Speaker 1>too common on the left and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually given birth to the natural </v>

94
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alt right.</v>

95
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I know this firsthand not only from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emails that you guys send me,</v>

96
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:47.764
<v Speaker 1>but also from all the students at Ucla </v>
<v Speaker 1>who came up to me after my event with </v>

97
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:52.264
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos a couple months ago to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me that they're supporting trump </v>

98
00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>just because they can't take the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fear around speech anymore.</v>

99
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>The alt right with its trump frogs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>photoshop.</v>

100
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.354
<v Speaker 1>Pictures of sick Hillary is little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a bunch of guys in their basements </v>

101
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.673
<v Speaker 1>using outreach culture against itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us are not part of the </v>

102
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>regressive left or the alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is precisely why we must talk about</v>

103
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 1>ideas honestly and not let the extremes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on either side control the debate.</v>

104
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.963
<v Speaker 1>As I've said many times before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's wall might not be sensible or </v>

105
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:27.194
<v Speaker 1>sound policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a wall in and of itself is not </v>

106
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:30.884
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we refused to have a conversation </v>

107
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>about immigration without yelling racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>at everyone who disagrees with us,</v>

108
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>then we'll leave the conversation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who comes up with an easy answer.</v>

109
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Trump's wall is the easy answer to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex immigration problem and it's one</v>

110
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons that the alt right loves </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

111
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.490
<v Speaker 1>The alt right is the organic result of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically correct society that refuses</v>

112
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>to engage in ideas in an honest way.</v>

113
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean the alt right is </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

114
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 1>It just means that they're here and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonize them without understanding them</v>

115
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 1>doesn't stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually strengthens them.</v>

116
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.073
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam Scott is the creator of the </v>

117
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>nationally syndicated comic strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dilbert,</v>

118
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>as well as a proponent of Donald Trump's</v>
<v Speaker 1>tactics.</v>

119
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he considers himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the alt right,</v>

120
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:20.834
<v Speaker 1>but I would consider him part of it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's using Internet culture to </v>

121
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>spread his ideas during this insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>election cycle.</v>

122
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>We're going to dive into his feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Donald trump and much more.</v>

123
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.683
<v Speaker 1>We'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter Nazis make memes of us in Nazi </v>

124
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the interview,</v>

125
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 1>you'll only know if we retweet them </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

126
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.243
<v Speaker 2>My guest this week is an author and </v>
<v Speaker 2>creator of the legendary dilbert comic </v>

127
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 2>strip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott Adams.</v>

128
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me.</v>

129
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm very excited to talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we get into anything,</v>

130
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:59.731
<v Speaker 2>you've also received the Rubin Award,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is for outstanding cartoonists.</v>

131
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.280
<v Speaker 2>They spell it the other way though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coincidentally.</v>

132
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:04.114
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it's not as prestigious as you </v>

133
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:07.594
<v Speaker 2>might think because they changed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules some years ago that you couldn't </v>

134
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:13.480
<v Speaker 2>win it more than once a and there aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>that many cartoonists in the world,</v>

135
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.130
<v Speaker 2>so if you stay alive long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a good shot at a Rubin Award,</v>

136
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.850
<v Speaker 2>then you're pretty much good to win one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want it back.</v>

137
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 2>That's silver 15 years ago or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

138
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.420
<v Speaker 2>You want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is amazing because I'm so young.</v>

139
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.940
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

140
00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:28.774
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very excited to talk to you and </v>

141
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:30.190
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>

142
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Definitely do the politics stuff and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump stuff and all that,</v>

143
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.833
<v Speaker 2>but first for the people that probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>know dilbert but don't know much about </v>

144
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 2>you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.190
<v Speaker 2>you have a sort of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>backstory.</v>

146
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.053
<v Speaker 2>What kind of led you to becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoon and it's everything you used to </v>

147
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.730
<v Speaker 2>be a regular working man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that fair to say?</v>

148
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

149
00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:50.974
<v Speaker 2>I worked in two big companies now </v>
<v Speaker 2>working in a big bank in a cubicle and </v>

150
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>then I went to the phone and worked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another</v>

151
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.970
<v Speaker 3>cubicle and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

152
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

153
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 3>both of my career has ended the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

154
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 3>I keep forgetting I can say anything I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want on here.</v>

155
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 3>You can say absolutely anything for </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

156
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.533
<v Speaker 3>There are things that I've sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>censor it or played down in my </v>

157
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:10.824
<v Speaker 3>backstory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's break you out of self </v>

158
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 3>censorship right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it right down there.</v>

159
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

160
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.713
<v Speaker 3>my banking career ended when my boss </v>
<v Speaker 3>called me in her office and told me in </v>

161
00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 3>direct language as directly as I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell you that she couldn't promote me</v>

162
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 3>anytime in the future because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white male.</v>

163
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.483
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said it wasn't discrimination </v>

164
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:32.880
<v Speaker 3>per se in the normal sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was that the,</v>

165
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:33.714
<v Speaker 3>I guess the local newspaper had </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered that there was no diversity </v>

166
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.170
<v Speaker 3>in senior management and in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reverse that,</v>

167
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 3>since the pipeline wasn't as good as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>should've been in either,</v>

168
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 3>they pretty much just had to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>promoting people who look like me.</v>

169
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

170
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long is that going to last?</v>

171
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 3>And she said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

172
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:59.190
<v Speaker 3>it took 200 years to get here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it might take awhile to reverse this.</v>

173
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 3>I made up that part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was implied.</v>

174
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I put my resume together and I left,</v>

175
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 3>went to Pacific Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started working there.</v>

176
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got on the fast track.</v>

177
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 3>I was identified as an up and comer who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was ready for management.</v>

178
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 3>And one day my boss called me into his </v>
<v Speaker 3>office and he sat down and I had to tell</v>

179
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 3>you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the word has come down.</v>

180
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't promote white males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

181
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.123
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the same reason it was the </v>

182
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.223
<v Speaker 3>newspaper had discovered that they too </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a problem with diversity as senior </v>

183
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:32.634
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the point that as I like to </v>

184
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hear the story,</v>

185
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.700
<v Speaker 3>you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

186
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:40.710
<v Speaker 3>that must have been a really bad day for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

187
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.233
<v Speaker 3>but turns out that the moment you </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized that your efforts and your </v>

188
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 3>outcomes are not related,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really frees up your schedule.</v>

189
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 3>So suddenly I taed for hobbies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't coming in so early,</v>

190
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:54.864
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't working so late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started looking for other things to </v>

191
00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:58.680
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

192
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 3>the things that I could control my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>fate a little bit.</v>

193
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.503
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things I tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's one of the many things I've </v>

194
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 3>tried to do both before and after </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gilbert,</v>

195
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 3>was to get a comic strip published,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know how to do that.</v>

196
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

197
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.620
<v Speaker 3>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's the,</v>

198
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 3>what's the process for getting a comic </v>
<v Speaker 3>strip started?</v>

199
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.383
<v Speaker 3>This was pre internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't find out anything free </v>

200
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hard to believe that time existed.</v>

201
00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 3>It was the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is a true story.</v>

202
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:26.664
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of the amazing luck part </v>

203
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 3>that everybody has in their story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some point,</v>

204
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any successful person,</v>

205
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:34.620
<v Speaker 3>if you look at their story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I worked hard,</v>

206
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:35.730
<v Speaker 3>I worked harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked hard.</v>

207
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 3>This really fricking lucky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then something good happened.</v>

208
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in my context where lots of things </v>

209
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:42.504
<v Speaker 3>that didn't work out for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got real lucky this time and I </v>

210
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came home,</v>

211
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I become a cartoonist?</v>

212
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:49.663
<v Speaker 3>And I was flipping through the channels </v>
<v Speaker 3>on TV and it was a TV show on how to </v>

213
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 3>become a cartoonist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

214
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.750
<v Speaker 3>but I'd missed like 28 minutes of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>half hour,</v>

215
00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.673
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just figured out what that's what </v>

216
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:01.834
<v Speaker 3>that must have been about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote down the name of the host </v>

217
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 3>from the closing credits and I wrote him</v>
<v Speaker 3>a regular snail mail letter and I said,</v>

218
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 3>how do you become a cartoonist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he answered two page letter,</v>

219
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy this book,</v>

220
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 3>use these materials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

221
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.653
<v Speaker 3>whatever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get discouraged because the real </v>

222
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 3>tough industry and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get rejected a lot,</v>

223
00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't give up.</v>

224
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.680
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

225
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.381
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was great.</v>

226
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:27.214
<v Speaker 3>I bought the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the materials and put together </v>

227
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 3>some comics that were just single panel </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics,</v>

228
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 3>send them off to the major magazines </v>
<v Speaker 3>they ever rejected.</v>

229
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought,</v>

230
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried,</v>

231
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the best you can do is try.</v>

232
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 3>So I put all my materials in the closet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I forgot about it.</v>

233
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:45.843
<v Speaker 3>A year goes by and one day I walk out </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the post office or to the mailbox </v>

234
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.183
<v Speaker 3>and there's a letter there from this </v>
<v Speaker 3>same cartoonist who had sent me the </v>

235
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:54.694
<v Speaker 3>original advice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his name is Jack Cassidy and if he's </v>

236
00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:59.440
<v Speaker 3>watching this hijack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

237
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.733
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that he was cleaning his office </v>

238
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 3>and he came across my letter that was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of a pile and he said that he</v>

239
00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 3>was just writing to make sure that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't given up.</v>

240
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.453
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the only reason he wrote </v>

241
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.590
<v Speaker 3>and I had given up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought,</v>

242
00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:18.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he knows something.</v>

243
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you see something that,</v>

244
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.270
<v Speaker 3>that even the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

245
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the magazines didn't see in my work.</v>

246
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 3>So I decided to raise my sights to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become,</v>

247
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.533
<v Speaker 3>to try to become a syndicated cartoonist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and newspapers all over the world as </v>

248
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:33.750
<v Speaker 3>opposed to just trying to get at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

249
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 3>a comic in a magazine because I figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I got rejected at that,</v>

250
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.090
<v Speaker 3>it would feel like progress because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be good.</v>

251
00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Rejected at a higher level that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel good.</v>

252
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent out my samples and united media,</v>

253
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 3>one of the big sin that gets called and </v>
<v Speaker 3>offered me a contract.</v>

254
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:50.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really just a great story </v>

255
00:13:52.821 --> 00:13:53.654
<v Speaker 2>of not just perseverance but also that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else that you didn't even know </v>

256
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.670
<v Speaker 2>really dragged you back in when you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and also that your,</v>

257
00:14:01.671 --> 00:14:05.540
<v Speaker 2>your work before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit that dead end of,</v>

258
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going any further here.</v>

259
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.163
<v Speaker 2>It happened to me because of your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting the way you described </v>

260
00:14:11.361 --> 00:14:13.220
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't sound like you were,</v>

261
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.653
<v Speaker 2>you sound like you sort of understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing even though each </v>

262
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.550
<v Speaker 2>node as against he wasn't working for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

263
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have two minds of that.</v>

264
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's my social mind which says yes,</v>

265
00:14:24.861 --> 00:14:25.694
<v Speaker 3>there was no diversity in two major </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies that that's not a longterm </v>

266
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.900
<v Speaker 3>sustainable situation in this kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

267
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.183
<v Speaker 3>so it had to be fixed and if you let it </v>
<v Speaker 3>get fixed in its natural course of </v>

268
00:14:38.421 --> 00:14:40.130
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would take too long.</v>

269
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.413
<v Speaker 3>It just would be untenable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is also true that when someone </v>

270
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.903
<v Speaker 3>who looks like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a white male in 1979 gets fired from a </v>

271
00:14:49.821 --> 00:14:50.654
<v Speaker 3>job without doing bad job or in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>case to sort of encouraged to quit </v>

272
00:14:55.521 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had lots of opportunities so it wasn't</v>

273
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing in the world for me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it worked out well obviously.</v>

274
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

275
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 3>I have two minds about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was good for society,</v>

276
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:07.004
<v Speaker 3>bad for me at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it worked out good for me in the </v>

277
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 3>long run.</v>

278
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think in 2016,</v>

279
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:11.594
<v Speaker 3>if the same thing happened to sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle management white guy and they </v>

280
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:15.490
<v Speaker 3>were told that now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

281
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 3>do you think the reaction from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average person would be the same?</v>

282
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you think a normal corporate </v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere?</v>

283
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they would say it in such </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorta.</v>

284
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.850
<v Speaker 3>I think everything ages certain times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

285
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 3>So the tool you need know you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjust it for the time.</v>

286
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.610
<v Speaker 3>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

287
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 3>if it's years ago and you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>slavery,</v>

288
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 3>you need a civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

289
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Speaker 3>You got to go for the biggest bluntness </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapon you can,</v>

290
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 3>if it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

291
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:43.901
<v Speaker 3>the seventies and you still don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>good representation in top jobs.</v>

292
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.140
<v Speaker 3>You need something less blunt than a </v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war,</v>

293
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.370
<v Speaker 3>but far more blunt than doing nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just hoping for things to change.</v>

294
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was in favor of a sort of a punch </v>

295
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 3>in the nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

296
00:15:57.381 --> 00:15:58.214
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

297
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 3>to try to get things kick started.</v>

298
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 3>But now I think things have improved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

299
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

300
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 3>we haven't ended racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't ended sexism.</v>

301
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are pockets in which it really</v>

302
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:11.880
<v Speaker 3>isn't a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

303
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 3>There are pockets where it's probably a </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge problem,</v>

304
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but you can choose your pocket now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you were somewhere where there's a</v>

305
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 3>huge problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do mostly have mobility.</v>

306
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.333
<v Speaker 3>You can quit that job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can find a place where you do have </v>

307
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 3>an advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

308
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.303
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a picture today this running </v>

309
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 3>around twitter of the Huffington Post </v>
<v Speaker 3>editorial board.</v>

310
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.780
<v Speaker 3>It's 100 percent of white women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

311
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.200
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're working for a company,</v>

312
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 3>you're a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a white woman,</v>

313
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 3>you got discriminated against,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is someplace you can go,</v>

314
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.593
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're probably something like the </v>

315
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:44.370
<v Speaker 3>opposite is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

316
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.463
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not saying that's good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that in the world of </v>

317
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:50.480
<v Speaker 3>2016 you can leave where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

318
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mobility of sorts.</v>

319
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has perfect mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't move.</v>

320
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can control your own fate and the</v>

321
00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 3>way that you couldn't in 1979.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

322
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:02.210
<v Speaker 3>And it's funny because if we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the same Huffington post picture,</v>

323
00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:05.000
<v Speaker 3>it's a long table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the women and the woman who took the</v>

324
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 3>picture is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

325
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:07.064
<v Speaker 3>look at our diversity here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She means diversity in that there's a </v>

326
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:11.240
<v Speaker 3>lot of women or something to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

327
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:12.074
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's actually showing you that's </v>

328
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.730
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different than just all white men,</v>

329
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:17.803
<v Speaker 3>but does that really diversity per se.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was amazing bit of blindness that </v>

330
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:25.160
<v Speaker 3>someone could tweet that publicly and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>proud of it.</v>

331
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Now I think we're all happy that women </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have,</v>

332
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the opportunities.</v>

333
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:33.080
<v Speaker 3>I have literally never met anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought differently about that topic.</v>

334
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.303
<v Speaker 3>So you believe women are equal before </v>
<v Speaker 3>the commenters start going out and I </v>

335
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:39.050
<v Speaker 3>know he hates women or something.</v>

336
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I believe in equal opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every individual is different,</v>

337
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 3>but of course you have to have equal </v>
<v Speaker 3>access.</v>

338
00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Equal opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

339
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's jump forward.</v>

340
00:17:48.711 --> 00:17:49.544
<v Speaker 3>So now you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the cartoon out there and it </v>

341
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:52.974
<v Speaker 3>starts taking off how much of it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>rattling around all the ideas of </v>

342
00:17:56.581 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Dilbert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very much takes place obviously</v>

343
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 3>in the time of your life that you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>working in the corporate atmosphere.</v>

344
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 3>How much of those ideas were rattling </v>
<v Speaker 3>around in you while you were doing it?</v>

345
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.384
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that just your creative outlet to </v>

346
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:10.510
<v Speaker 3>not go crazy in a corporate job?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

347
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.423
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that Dilbert was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sum of all my frustrations from my </v>

348
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Speaker 3>corporate world and it gave me an outlet</v>
<v Speaker 3>for them.</v>

349
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't been thinking in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

350
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to make a comic about that until I</v>

351
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:25.320
<v Speaker 3>actually started working on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

352
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.550
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a handy outlet by personality.</v>

353
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited by problems.</v>

354
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited by chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it can,</v>

355
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:38.750
<v Speaker 3>I swear you can swear away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you no rules.</v>

356
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.680
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't getting a if things go to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

357
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly I feel good because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>always opportunity.</v>

358
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

359
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Things are broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the very least,</v>

360
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 3>there's a job for somebody who fixes </v>
<v Speaker 3>broken stuff,</v>

361
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every time something that's broken,</v>

362
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:53.881
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

363
00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:55.200
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an opportunity here.</v>

364
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.393
<v Speaker 3>So I just love that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably a good segue to the </v>

365
00:18:58.831 --> 00:18:59.664
<v Speaker 3>trump stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to do some other stuff </v>

366
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.970
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we quite get there.</v>

367
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 3>So I was doing a little research and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew you were into hypnotism.</v>

368
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had to test.</v>

369
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.240
<v Speaker 3>You are a trained certified hypnotist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

370
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 3>How did that come to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A well,</v>

371
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:13.254
<v Speaker 3>the back story and that is that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother gave birth to my younger sister </v>

372
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.320
<v Speaker 3>while my mother was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

373
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 3>hypnosis a while while she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnotized.</v>

374
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 3>My family doctor was a hypnotist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

375
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:26.100
<v Speaker 3>and we hope he is a medical doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know he was at least after this.</v>

376
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

377
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:29.030
<v Speaker 3>you all came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

378
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all okay about.</v>

379
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.293
<v Speaker 3>And My mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother reports that she felt no pain </v>

380
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 3>did not have any drugs during childbirth</v>
<v Speaker 3>and was awake the whole time.</v>

381
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:45.210
<v Speaker 3>And now this is an unusual situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even even though,</v>

382
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:46.044
<v Speaker 3>well hypnotized person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 percent at tops could feel that kind </v>

383
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:50.394
<v Speaker 3>of extreme phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other 80 percent can be deeply </v>

384
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 3>influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when I heard that story,</v>

385
00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:58.440
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty young when I heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

386
00:19:58.441 --> 00:20:01.560
<v Speaker 3>what is the superpower and how can I get</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

387
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.113
<v Speaker 3>It was part of my process of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulate skills that would layer well </v>

388
00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 3>on whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever I was naturally good at.</v>

389
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

390
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.043
<v Speaker 3>knowing how the human mind works now he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had an influence at knowing how to </v>

391
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.840
<v Speaker 3>hypnotize people has got to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

392
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where would that not be a good idea?</v>

393
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

394
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:24.120
<v Speaker 3>so do you practice it some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

395
00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:28.470
<v Speaker 3>do people come to you if someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a smoking problem or uh,</v>

396
00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:30.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat too much or something and you say,</v>

397
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be hit and Desi and how do you</v>

398
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 3>use it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

399
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.180
<v Speaker 3>So I've sentenced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>broadened what I,</v>

400
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 3>what I call it hypnosis to include </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything in the field of persuasion,</v>

401
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 3>influence it could be advertising a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

402
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:45.900
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the dating realm,</v>

403
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Game Theory or whatever it's called.</v>

404
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there,</v>

405
00:20:49.741 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 3>there are a million forms of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all,</v>

406
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.420
<v Speaker 3>it's all about how to influence people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there in the irrational sense.</v>

407
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could be using some of the basics</v>

408
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:00.790
<v Speaker 2>of hypnotism right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not putting.</v>

409
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.370
<v Speaker 2>So people think of hypnotism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

410
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting for you to pull out the Stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch and put me to sleep.</v>

411
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:06.424
<v Speaker 2>But you're saying there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of skills and lessons you </v>

412
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 2>learned in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can apply that you probably put</v>

413
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 2>into Dilbert and that you certainly are </v>
<v Speaker 2>using on twitter and things like that.</v>

414
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 3>So when I was learning hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I was doing the,</v>

415
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.183
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting people in so-called hypnosis </v>

416
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:22.294
<v Speaker 3>trances and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing things like having them remember </v>

417
00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 3>their past lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is not real.</v>

418
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:28.043
<v Speaker 2>The past life things that really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know a couple of people reading </v>

419
00:21:31.441 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 2>that journey of souls know that during </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sit bone,</v>

420
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's all about the past life </v>
<v Speaker 2>regression and that whole thing.</v>

421
00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

422
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

423
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.810
<v Speaker 3>as practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would run a little ad in the local rag</v>

424
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.820
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come in for $20.</v>

425
00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:45.654
<v Speaker 3>I will hypnotize you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't show you your past lives and </v>

426
00:21:48.331 --> 00:21:49.164
<v Speaker 3>person after person came in and sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough under hypnosis they could </v>

427
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.780
<v Speaker 3>remember past lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the time I thought I was actually</v>

428
00:21:56.971 --> 00:21:58.170
<v Speaker 3>open minded about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

429
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.030
<v Speaker 3>well maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

430
00:22:00.031 --> 00:22:02.980
<v Speaker 3>how do you rule it out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'd have to do a few.</v>

431
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.240
<v Speaker 3>You realize that none of them have lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you haven't seen on television.</v>

432
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

433
00:22:09.211 --> 00:22:10.044
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

434
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.170
<v Speaker 3>I was an Ethiopian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

435
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.550
<v Speaker 3>something that you wouldn't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how their life was.</v>

436
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was an Egyptian princess or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>viking or a cowboy.</v>

437
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I think the most exotic Wa was a French </v>
<v Speaker 3>surf,</v>

438
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm thinking nobody's.</v>

439
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the other thing.</v>

440
00:22:30.781 --> 00:22:31.614
<v Speaker 3>I had person after person come in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not one of them was Chinese in a prior </v>

441
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:39.020
<v Speaker 3>life and do some math,</v>
<v Speaker 3>math.</v>

442
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

443
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of China,</v>

444
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.693
<v Speaker 3>a lot of Chinese people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody was Chinese and her prayer </v>

445
00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:45.594
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>

446
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.310
<v Speaker 3>if there were such things as prior life.</v>

447
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.243
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think that tells you </v>

448
00:22:48.731 --> 00:22:52.180
<v Speaker 2>about the human psyche or the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition that people,</v>

449
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 2>you'd put them under Gnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you believe is a good practice and</v>

450
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 2>that ultimately there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would say that that's.</v>

451
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Then their site subconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just exercising itself.</v>

452
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

453
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.930
<v Speaker 2>it's combining with their ego to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>just make up stories.</v>

454
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:08.883
<v Speaker 3>It's not just their subconscious is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that the hypnotist has implanted </v>

455
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:15.310
<v Speaker 3>the suggestion that they can retrieve </v>
<v Speaker 3>their past memory,</v>

456
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.480
<v Speaker 3>and so that's enough that they imagine </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are having actual memories.</v>

457
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:20.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main thing you learn to practice </v>

458
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:28.000
<v Speaker 3>hypnosis to be a hypnotist is you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand that people are irrational</v>

459
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.350
<v Speaker 3>all the time about everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't understand that,</v>

460
00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:36.220
<v Speaker 3>you can't even do it because none of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would make sense for a rational person.</v>

461
00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 3>People aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

462
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:41.950
<v Speaker 3>if you think people are affected by data</v>
<v Speaker 3>and facts and good arguments,</v>

463
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>you can't even do hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing just falls apart.</v>

464
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:47.503
<v Speaker 3>You wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think everyone though is like </v>

465
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:49.260
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

466
00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:54.200
<v Speaker 3>You think 100 percent of the world are </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational pretty much all the time.</v>

467
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:55.034
<v Speaker 3>The Times when you're not or trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know if you're balancing your </v>

468
00:23:57.891 --> 00:23:58.724
<v Speaker 3>checkbook or or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or trying to decide which object is </v>

469
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 3>heavier and how much you need to lift it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as probably a rational decision,</v>

470
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 3>but those are trivial in terms of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

471
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to affect the house you </v>
<v Speaker 3>live,</v>

472
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.100
<v Speaker 3>you decide to live in the job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take the person you marry.</v>

473
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna Affect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

474
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you,</v>

475
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 3>even the way you dress most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It certainly won't affect your political</v>

476
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

477
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:21.314
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would say those choices are done </v>

478
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:25.100
<v Speaker 3>in an irrational manner for most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>buying a house.</v>

479
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:25.934
<v Speaker 3>I mean people spend a lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring out what house to buy or what </v>

480
00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:31.760
<v Speaker 3>career to go and do you think those are </v>
<v Speaker 3>done it through irrational.</v>

481
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.113
<v Speaker 3>We make our decisions about people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and the first few seconds and </v>

482
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 3>then everything after that is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationalization.</v>

483
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a perfect examples from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

484
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:46.220
<v Speaker 3>A few prior relationships ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were looking for a house,</v>

485
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.290
<v Speaker 3>looked at a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We both did like him.</v>

486
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 3>We drove up to the house.</v>

487
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 3>We ended up buying sat in the car </v>
<v Speaker 3>without even going inside the house.</v>

488
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Looked at each other and laughed because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was our house [inaudible].</v>

489
00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.630
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

490
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.470
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had a look at a feel,</v>

491
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 3>but without even seeing the inside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the house without knowing,</v>

492
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.593
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we would pay or anything like that </v>

493
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 3>we had decided in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure enough we bought that house.</v>

494
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Likewise.</v>

495
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:14.090
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was great.</v>

496
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And another relationship,</v>

497
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 3>we're looking for a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

498
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 3>with my ex wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at car after car.</v>

499
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:21.734
<v Speaker 3>We pulled into one dealer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stood there and looked at the car and I </v>

500
00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 3>just laughed because I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about the guard,</v>

501
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 3>didn't know the specs to know the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mileage.</v>

502
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.963
<v Speaker 3>It didn't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just knew that was going to be our </v>

503
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:30.950
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure enough.</v>

504
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for the people that go to a good </v>

505
00:25:34.131 --> 00:25:34.964
<v Speaker 3>Julian houses and inspect every inch or </v>
<v Speaker 3>that go to 27 car dealerships and all </v>

506
00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:41.510
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

507
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.910
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would describe that.</v>

508
00:25:42.911 --> 00:25:44.750
<v Speaker 3>That's just sort of a different way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing things.</v>

509
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:48.920
<v Speaker 3>You're sort of going to find a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to appear.</v>

510
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:51.290
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not saying that everybody's doing</v>

511
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:52.520
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm aware of.</v>

512
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:56.330
<v Speaker 3>But you're aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly there are some,</v>

513
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.570
<v Speaker 3>some things that would eliminate a car </v>
<v Speaker 3>from your potential.</v>

514
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 3>If you're looking for a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to buy a prius.</v>

515
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.353
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a little bit of common sense </v>

516
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:05.354
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you get down to those final </v>

517
00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:07.690
<v Speaker 3>choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

518
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.260
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just how it feels.</v>

519
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

520
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.320
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we go to politics?</v>

521
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where they want us.</v>

522
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:15.614
<v Speaker 3>This is where all the trump frogs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very excited that I'm talking to </v>

523
00:26:17.481 --> 00:26:18.310
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what they want.</v>

524
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.143
<v Speaker 3>Did they fast forward to this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>However they already put on twitter the </v>

525
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.380
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say Skip.</v>

526
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.680
<v Speaker 3>The first x amount is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good stuff is at blah,</v>

527
00:26:25.681 --> 00:26:26.211
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

528
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:27.200
<v Speaker 3>He had a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

529
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 3>let's get to trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

530
00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:29.870
<v Speaker 3>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about trump a little bit.</v>

531
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.650
<v Speaker 3>So my sense of your support of trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

532
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 3>please correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not that you love him or his policies</v>

533
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:40.574
<v Speaker 3>don't always support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go too far with that </v>

534
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:43.970
<v Speaker 3>word out there.</v>

535
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 2>And you've said some interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your support of Hillary.</v>

536
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.890
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

537
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

538
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 2>that it's not that you're necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting trump,</v>

539
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.513
<v Speaker 2>but you like the techniques or you at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least understand the techniques that </v>

540
00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:57.954
<v Speaker 2>he's using to get his message across and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're very much in line with </v>

541
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:03.270
<v Speaker 2>some of the techniques that you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>described to me.</v>

542
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Is that a fair estimation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll backtrack the word support if</v>

543
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.260
<v Speaker 3>put it in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

544
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.091
<v Speaker 3>my words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

545
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:11.880
<v Speaker 3>And put the context straight here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

546
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.643
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that anybody who was about</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years old should get hired for a </v>

547
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 3>job that requires great mental agility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flexibility,</v>

548
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.620
<v Speaker 3>high energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even staying alive,</v>

549
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:26.454
<v Speaker 3>which is very important to do the job of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a president if they keep saying he's </v>

550
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:30.180
<v Speaker 3>high energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be alive.</v>

551
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

552
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.083
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard for me to get on board </v>
<v Speaker 3>either of those choices because really </v>

553
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:36.503
<v Speaker 3>320 million people in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the best we could get his two 70 </v>

554
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 3>year old racist or biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

555
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:44.620
<v Speaker 3>depending on which side you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at it.</v>

556
00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:44.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

557
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:48.000
<v Speaker 3>we'll get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both Megan and secondly,</v>

558
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:51.930
<v Speaker 3>my political views that don't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>align closely with either one of them,</v>

559
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.040
<v Speaker 3>but that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I noticed last year,</v>

560
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:56.874
<v Speaker 3>it was trump ahead a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an influencing or influencers I'm </v>

561
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 3>toolset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

562
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:04.523
<v Speaker 3>he had the skills of the hypnotist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the skills of persuasion that I </v>

563
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:10.014
<v Speaker 3>immediately said being fairly early on </v>
<v Speaker 3>last year and said that's not normal </v>

564
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 3>while he's doing his technique that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't understand,</v>

565
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.503
<v Speaker 3>he's just a better persuader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm a big fan of his persuasion </v>

566
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 3>talents and I think people need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that in context and maybe not</v>

567
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:28.104
<v Speaker 3>think of him as the crazy clown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was lots of times there's intention </v>

568
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 3>there and there's a lot of strategy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

569
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:36.420
<v Speaker 3>he's playing the long game and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

570
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

571
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.130
<v Speaker 2>So can you describe that part of it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

572
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people will say,</v>

573
00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:41.394
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just nuts or he says anything and </v>

574
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:43.884
<v Speaker 2>it's just all crazy and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying really is that </v>

575
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:50.340
<v Speaker 2>there is a method to this madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not just walking up there every day</v>

576
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.443
<v Speaker 2>and saying crazy things with no plan </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's an actual plan and it's </v>

577
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.130
<v Speaker 2>pulling some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

578
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.990
<v Speaker 2>the tools that</v>

579
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.160
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Planning might be overstating it because</v>

580
00:29:02.161 --> 00:29:03.150
<v Speaker 3>who knows you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

581
00:29:03.151 --> 00:29:03.984
<v Speaker 3>in this kind of context how far in </v>
<v Speaker 3>advanced they really can plan or how </v>

582
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 3>much makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But definitely he is saying,</v>

583
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Speaker 3>how can I control the most energy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

584
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.443
<v Speaker 3>so persuasion is about making somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus on your thing until they think </v>

585
00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:20.664
<v Speaker 3>it's important because the human brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>is so dumb that it thinks whatever it </v>

586
00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:29.601
<v Speaker 3>pays attention to the most is the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the worst or the most important.</v>

587
00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:32.610
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their minds it's priority rises right</v>

588
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.683
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as he doesn't make too many </v>

589
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:36.480
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think he's the worst.</v>

590
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 3>The attention alone is a positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

591
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.870
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the heart of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

592
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.080
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

593
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.913
<v Speaker 3>that it's an attention game that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>using and that's why it was so easy to </v>

594
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:47.640
<v Speaker 3>dispatch the secret toolbox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

595
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 3>But if he had to mention one thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

596
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:50.503
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shining object and it would be </v>

597
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:52.443
<v Speaker 3>manipulating attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he also manipulates attention away </v>

598
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 3>from things he doesn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

599
00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:57.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

600
00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:58.563
<v Speaker 3>my best example is during the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate a year ago when trump was asked </v>

601
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:05.290
<v Speaker 3>about his comments about women in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>

602
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.560
<v Speaker 3>now this was a trap that nobody can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of,</v>

603
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.813
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say there's nothing you can </v>

604
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:15.121
<v Speaker 3>say because now the media has made </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's attention on these bad things.</v>

605
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 3>So just focusing on it makes them seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher priority.</v>

606
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.320
<v Speaker 3>What does trump say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

607
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.423
<v Speaker 3>only rosie o'donnell and suddenly all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the energy sucked out of the question </v>

608
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 3>and went to this visual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person who is disliked,</v>

609
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 3>at least by the base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

610
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:33.220
<v Speaker 3>the Republicans could be counted on to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an extreme reaction.</v>

611
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.370
<v Speaker 3>So it's a face whenever you can put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>face to something,</v>

612
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:41.100
<v Speaker 3>a personality and a visual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the energy just sucks into the room.</v>

613
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.240
<v Speaker 3>And that was the moment I got out of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>chair.</v>

614
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.280
<v Speaker 3>So I wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not normal.</v>

615
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.740
<v Speaker 3>And then I watched to see if he could </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeat it and he kept doing it and doing</v>

616
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then by the time he was doing the,</v>

617
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.793
<v Speaker 3>the low energy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was the first person probably </v>

618
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:58.210
<v Speaker 3>in the country who said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

619
00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:02.320
<v Speaker 3>that's not a random insult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the end of Bush is dead.</v>

620
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.513
<v Speaker 3>And there isn't as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what I call linguistic kill </v>

621
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:08.860
<v Speaker 3>shots are not just insults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people thought.</v>

622
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Speaker 3>The first part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are engineered,</v>

623
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:12.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look at low energy,</v>

624
00:31:12.581 --> 00:31:13.960
<v Speaker 3>how engineered this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

625
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 3>He takes something that hasn't been used</v>
<v Speaker 3>before in the political realm.</v>

626
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.393
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the usual thing you say in </v>

627
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:20.014
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So therefore you can imbue it with his </v>

628
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 3>own meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

629
00:31:22.871 --> 00:31:26.860
<v Speaker 3>It's his own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he picks something that matches the</v>

630
00:31:26.861 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 3>physicality of the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another big trick or something.</v>

631
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:32.160
<v Speaker 3>When you look at them and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

632
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.540
<v Speaker 3>that feels right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

633
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 3>Now here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before he said that,</v>

634
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.840
<v Speaker 3>before he reframed a Bush as being low </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>

635
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I think most people had the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>impression I did.</v>

636
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 3>I looked at that guy and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

637
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:47.920
<v Speaker 3>he looks like a calm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seasoned executive.</v>

638
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.073
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like he would be unruffled and </v>

639
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.183
<v Speaker 3>even a nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly the kind of executive I </v>

640
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:54.364
<v Speaker 3>was running my country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Bush says low energy and every </v>

641
00:31:57.431 --> 00:31:58.780
<v Speaker 3>time you look at it and after that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

642
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does look a little low energy and you</v>

643
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 3>don't even know why that's bad.</v>

644
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.530
<v Speaker 3>And the edit fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're in a bad.</v>

645
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.600
<v Speaker 3>So now he's created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the second,</v>

646
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other,</v>

647
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.273
<v Speaker 3>the other part that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He creates a trap for confirmation bias </v>

648
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.343
<v Speaker 3>so that everything that Bush does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using his normal personality makes you </v>

649
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:19.260
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

650
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 3>it just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his label reinforces over time.</v>

651
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.593
<v Speaker 3>Same with Lion Ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ted Cruz unfortunately has a little bit </v>

652
00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:29.680
<v Speaker 3>of a distrust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>full face,</v>

653
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of slimy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people just have that face,</v>

654
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

655
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.910
<v Speaker 3>And because he's a politician and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to say things that aren't true,</v>

656
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.320
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

657
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:39.663
<v Speaker 3>but he got the tag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your confirmation bias will go to </v>

658
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:43.850
<v Speaker 3>everything he says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's lying,</v>

659
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:44.684
<v Speaker 3>he's lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that really the genius of this </v>

660
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:47.354
<v Speaker 3>that he said Lion Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he calls her crooked hillary when </v>

661
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:50.954
<v Speaker 3>there's every evidence to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone could call him those things and </v>

662
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:54.764
<v Speaker 3>be just as truthful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not more truthful than he's being </v>

663
00:32:57.621 --> 00:32:58.454
<v Speaker 3>right because he's taken every position </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about some of the </v>

664
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:01.244
<v Speaker 3>immigration stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's already scaling that back so </v>

665
00:33:02.671 --> 00:33:03.504
<v Speaker 3>well while it's important to pick the </v>
<v Speaker 3>one that people are already sort of </v>

666
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.463
<v Speaker 3>prime to believe or there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>about his physicality that would make </v>

667
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:11.840
<v Speaker 3>them easily believe that trump.</v>

668
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things you can say </v>
<v Speaker 3>about him,</v>

669
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:14.863
<v Speaker 3>but what a Clinton has finally jumped on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was sort of late in the process </v>

670
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 3>because she was fighting Bernie and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a different fight.</v>

671
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 3>But at this point she is going with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the racist,</v>

672
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 3>irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist thing.</v>

673
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that too is an engineered killshot I</v>

674
00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:30.944
<v Speaker 3>believe I'm reasonably certain that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>has professionals working for one in </v>

675
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:36.194
<v Speaker 3>particular that I've nicknamed Godzilla </v>
<v Speaker 3>Godzilla is my pet name for Robert </v>

676
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Cialdini who wrote the book influence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

677
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 3>who would be considered that the monster</v>
<v Speaker 3>of persuasion,</v>

678
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.580
<v Speaker 3>if you are going to hire one person to </v>
<v Speaker 3>persuade the world.</v>

679
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 3>This is the guy that's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And apparently he did consult on,</v>

680
00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama's campaign.</v>

681
00:33:59.050 --> 00:33:59.883
<v Speaker 3>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be surprising if he had not </v>

682
00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:04.100
<v Speaker 3>been asked at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have confirmation of that.</v>

683
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.383
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that Clinton went from </v>

684
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:11.060
<v Speaker 3>having no persuasion game at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about facts and their experience</v>

685
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:14.320
<v Speaker 3>and her policies and realizing that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't going to work.</v>

686
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 3>And then she went full trump the summer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

687
00:34:17.991 --> 00:34:20.630
<v Speaker 3>forget about all my facts and policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

688
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 3>she's not forgetting them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's not emphasizing.</v>

689
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.100
<v Speaker 3>You want to be real scared of this Guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin here.</v>

690
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:26.953
<v Speaker 3>And here's the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump was using fear as a persuasion </v>

691
00:34:30.561 --> 00:34:32.360
<v Speaker 3>technique is fears the best thing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do,</v>

692
00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:33.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You scare people.</v>

693
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 3>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to fix that first.</v>

694
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 3>You fixed your fear first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you work at the other stuff.</v>

695
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.530
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at these,</v>

696
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.393
<v Speaker 3>these terrorists coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the criminal who's crossing the </v>

697
00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:42.914
<v Speaker 3>border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the,</v>

698
00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy falling apart.</v>

699
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.690
<v Speaker 3>Now whether or not any that's true </v>
<v Speaker 3>generates fear.</v>

700
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Fear is real good for persuasion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That what did,</v>

701
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 3>what did Clinton half facts affects her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her experience,</v>

702
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.160
<v Speaker 3>that's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she ratcheted it up and said,</v>

703
00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real fear is trump,</v>

704
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

705
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Because trump is saying maybe you've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fear from terrorists,</v>

706
00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:05.813
<v Speaker 3>but if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the odds that a terrorist is </v>

707
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:08.930
<v Speaker 3>going to kill you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

708
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that fear is good fear it worked,</v>

709
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like a comprehensive fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets everybody in.</v>

710
00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:17.334
<v Speaker 3>Clinton said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if trump gets in the office is going to </v>

711
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 3>have his finger on the nuclear codes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all dead and suddenly she got all</v>

712
00:35:24.261 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 3>kinds of purchase and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and her poll numbers started rising.</v>

713
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.010
<v Speaker 3>She basically has a commercial outright </v>
<v Speaker 3>now saying exactly that.</v>

714
00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:32.600
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

715
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.433
<v Speaker 3>So do you think there was a calculated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that say then I guess about </v>

716
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>the Clinton campaign that pretty much</v>

717
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.843
<v Speaker 2>this all went down last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this all seems to have come to a </v>

718
00:35:40.711 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 2>head last week with the big speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling him a racist,</v>

719
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:44.743
<v Speaker 2>linking him to all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And breitbart and we'll get into all </v>

720
00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

721
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.680
<v Speaker 2>do you think there was really a sit down</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they said,</v>

722
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:50.514
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technique he's using is really </v>

723
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:58.101
<v Speaker 2>working and we have to now shift you out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of policy and all that stuff?</v>

724
00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or was it just,</v>

725
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.730
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of low hanging fruit to call </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone a racist.</v>

726
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it to each other now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

727
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.333
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a racist.</v>

728
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.663
<v Speaker 2>It's become meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for the most part the word has </v>

729
00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:09.294
<v Speaker 2>become sort of meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you think there was a real </v>

730
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:11.274
<v Speaker 2>calculated sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the technique he's using is </v>

731
00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:15.240
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We better start playing ball this way.</v>

732
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.253
<v Speaker 3>They're both doing what I call the AB </v>
<v Speaker 3>testing is a word from the technology </v>

733
00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:20.694
<v Speaker 3>world where you're testing one technique</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you measure how well it does </v>

734
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.190
<v Speaker 3>and then you test another and if that </v>
<v Speaker 3>works better,</v>

735
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.020
<v Speaker 3>you go with this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this one works better,</v>

736
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:31.320
<v Speaker 3>you try yet another one to see if that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>even better until you get the best one.</v>

737
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.030
<v Speaker 3>There is no doubt that they found out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are other attacks weren't working.</v>

738
00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.173
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a wiki leaks saying </v>

739
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:39.414
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought attacking him on his </v>

740
00:36:40.981 --> 00:36:41.814
<v Speaker 3>business acumen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it working because people sort of </v>

741
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 3>had it in their mind that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was good at that stuff,</v>

742
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.330
<v Speaker 3>whether that's true or not.</v>

743
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll show you some bankruptcies,</v>

744
00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 2>but they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute.</v>

745
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 2>He's still his buildings everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whether it's true or not.</v>

746
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trouble with the bankruptcy stories,</v>

747
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.900
<v Speaker 3>who's name is on 500 entities and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

748
00:36:57.901 --> 00:36:59.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four of them didn't go well.</v>

749
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.280
<v Speaker 3>So that's actually more like a home run </v>
<v Speaker 3>than a failure,</v>

750
00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

751
00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 3>in an entrepreneurial sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

752
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.983
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they tested until they </v>

753
00:37:08.521 --> 00:37:09.354
<v Speaker 3>found that the racist thing is the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuck and because of the way he </v>

754
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 3>talks is unfiltered a method and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies that he's put out,</v>

755
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.560
<v Speaker 3>they attract confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

756
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.520
<v Speaker 3>for those watching who don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>confirmation bias is,</v>

757
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a well known mental phenomena where</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think something's true,</v>

758
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.690
<v Speaker 3>you imagine every bit of evidence to </v>
<v Speaker 3>support that.</v>

759
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:32.480
<v Speaker 3>Whether it is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see,</v>

760
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.980
<v Speaker 3>you'll see it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you've decided by the way,</v>

761
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.470
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the hypnotist learns.</v>

762
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 3>The hypnotist learns that once you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided,</v>

763
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.400
<v Speaker 3>which is the irrational decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

764
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.343
<v Speaker 3>that there is no such thing as data and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and rational or logic just doesn't </v>

765
00:37:46.921 --> 00:37:47.290
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>

766
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.123
<v Speaker 2>That you basically will then just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through life finding just the things </v>

767
00:37:52.691 --> 00:37:55.970
<v Speaker 2>that validate what you have presupposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>way back.</v>

768
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.640
<v Speaker 3>And let me prove that beyond any doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if ration,</v>

769
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.230
<v Speaker 3>rational thinking and logic existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would only be one religion.</v>

770
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.823
<v Speaker 3>We would all just figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There would be mostly people all on one </v>

771
00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 3>side and these and these political </v>
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>

772
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:14.640
<v Speaker 3>not to every time it's about 50 slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>50.</v>

773
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds of that,</v>

774
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:16.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

775
00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:17.761
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

776
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:19.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked the question once,</v>

777
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.843
<v Speaker 3>where do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do all the smart people come out </v>

778
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 3>on this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you pulled only smart people,</v>

779
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.870
<v Speaker 3>well educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really well informed,</v>

780
00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 3>smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would they all have the same opinion now</v>

781
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.013
<v Speaker 3>if there was anything to logic and data </v>
<v Speaker 3>and thinking is thinking we're a real </v>

782
00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:38.044
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we,</v>

783
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were really,</v>

784
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:39.904
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking the right data and making the </v>

785
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:41.884
<v Speaker 3>right decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would mostly be on the same side </v>

786
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:47.200
<v Speaker 3>and these political questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

787
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:48.790
<v Speaker 3>even if it's 75,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25,</v>

788
00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:50.740
<v Speaker 3>it would be overwhelmingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

789
00:38:50.741 --> 00:38:52.010
<v Speaker 3>on one side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>

790
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 3>So as someone that cares about thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and critical thought and being smart and</v>

791
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.543
<v Speaker 3>all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has to be a little depressing for </v>

792
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

793
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you already said,</v>

794
00:39:01.721 --> 00:39:04.960
<v Speaker 3>the 70 year old part and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've only selected just these two,</v>

795
00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 3>but just the general discourse has to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of depressing,</v>

796
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not because remember,</v>

797
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:12.040
<v Speaker 3>since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

798
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.410
<v Speaker 3>since my twenties when I learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnosis,</v>

799
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.040
<v Speaker 3>I've abandoned the idea that anyone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational,</v>

800
00:39:18.041 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 3>including me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once you abandoned that,</v>

801
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:23.890
<v Speaker 3>the world becomes far less frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not more so.</v>

802
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at the world that the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are living in.</v>

803
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.410
<v Speaker 3>And I feel sorry for your bachelors </v>
<v Speaker 3>living,</v>

804
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.253
<v Speaker 3>living in this world because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the people who are on the </v>

805
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 3>other side of a political debate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>

806
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:38.890
<v Speaker 3>why can't they see the logic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rational arguments that are so clear</v>

807
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 3>to me?</v>

808
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is always the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an idiot.</v>

809
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Speaker 3>But guess what they're thinking they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

810
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:47.003
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're having exactly the same thought </v>

811
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:52.240
<v Speaker 3>where their set of confirmation bias and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so sure that they're right.</v>

812
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically you're saying you,</v>

813
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Scott Adams don't have any of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answers,</v>

814
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:00.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're just saying this is,</v>

815
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.833
<v Speaker 3>this is the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to deal with it in that </v>

816
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While I have all the answers,</v>

817
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:06.424
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about the political </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff you've got all the way and we </v>

818
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 3>haven't gotten to that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

819
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:10.980
<v Speaker 3>Well let's get to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>

820
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 3>You wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we get to all the answers.</v>

821
00:40:12.611 --> 00:40:15.610
<v Speaker 3>That will be a better thing to probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>end with all the answers to everything.</v>

822
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.533
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we'll wrap up the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could end the show if we get all the </v>

823
00:40:18.611 --> 00:40:19.530
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

824
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see.</v>

825
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm curious.</v>

826
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.640
<v Speaker 3>So the racist word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about it a lot on this show</v>

827
00:40:24.641 --> 00:40:25.474
<v Speaker 3>that one of my issues has been how the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left has used the words of bigotry and </v>

828
00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:31.960
<v Speaker 3>racism and homophobia and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

829
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:32.943
<v Speaker 3>They've used them so much to smear their</v>
<v Speaker 3>opponents that these words have no </v>

830
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 3>longer have any meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

831
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.290
<v Speaker 3>Totally disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

832
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:39.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Racist never loses its power even now </v>

833
00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:42.754
<v Speaker 3>because my feeling was absolutely need </v>
<v Speaker 3>both were firing at each other and it </v>

834
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 3>didn't feel like it took anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

835
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:50.020
<v Speaker 3>it's taken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's taken big time.</v>

836
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:51.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If if you talk to the average Clinton </v>

837
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 3>supporter about what they think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

838
00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:00.340
<v Speaker 3>and this is something I've not seen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>any other election,</v>

839
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.690
<v Speaker 3>you'll see the person who dislikes trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically shake.</v>

840
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people talk about them and </v>

841
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.400
<v Speaker 3>their handshake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of people.</v>

842
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.234
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is not just a few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Observation is common that people will </v>

843
00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:17.800
<v Speaker 3>spit and yell and shake and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the racist claim sticks.</v>

844
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not because they think his policies</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't as good.</v>

845
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 3>They prefer this approach has nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that they think is actually a racist.</v>

846
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.453
<v Speaker 3>They've literally been convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's that subset of Clinton </v>

847
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:31.024
<v Speaker 3>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My suspicion though is that the average </v>

848
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 3>person</v>

849
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the word racist,</v>

850
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:36.734
<v Speaker 2>sees the way these things have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>overused and the way we label everybody </v>

851
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.093
<v Speaker 2>and goes it actually in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you take the trump </v>

852
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 2>supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you call them a racist,</v>

853
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:46.814
<v Speaker 2>it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like it because they feel like </v>

854
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:49.004
<v Speaker 2>you've lost the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the word you're throwing out </v>

855
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:51.434
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

856
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:55.140
<v Speaker 3>There's confirmation bias in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>inaction.</v>

857
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.983
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the best example of </v>

858
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.380
<v Speaker 2>someone calls you something bad and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

859
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.413
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trump supporters believe is that </v>

860
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.830
<v Speaker 3>they're not racist or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a problem.</v>

861
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.023
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they imagined the world in which those </v>

862
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.310
<v Speaker 3>insults or ineffective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are totally effective.</v>

863
00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.213
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the strongest sauce you could </v>

864
00:42:13.321 --> 00:42:18.321
<v Speaker 3>possibly put on this spaghetti.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible analogy that was there.</v>

865
00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

866
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.103
<v Speaker 3>So that's the reason Clinton's using it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure they've tested everything </v>

867
00:42:24.391 --> 00:42:25.380
<v Speaker 3>else and found out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

868
00:42:25.381 --> 00:42:26.214
<v Speaker 3>this is super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let me get back to the confirmation </v>

869
00:42:29.041 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 3>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look at the charge and look at all of</v>

870
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:35.850
<v Speaker 3>the things that trump is accused of and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just pick anyone and of the bunch.</v>

871
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Let's take the judge curial a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he said that the judge couldn't be</v>

872
00:42:41.221 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 3>bias because in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

873
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.320
<v Speaker 3>in trump's words he was Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you hear that.</v>

874
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.910
<v Speaker 3>And even to my ears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>

875
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.650
<v Speaker 3>the judge would be biased.</v>

876
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:50.700
<v Speaker 3>That couldn't be biased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

877
00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:51.211
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

878
00:42:51.211 --> 00:42:52.044
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

879
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.850
<v Speaker 3>so even to my ears that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

880
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.940
<v Speaker 3>that's like a little red flag there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you back it up.</v>

881
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.840
<v Speaker 3>If you talk to someone who was born in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country and their parents came from</v>

882
00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:01.674
<v Speaker 3>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they call themselves while </v>

883
00:43:03.421 --> 00:43:04.254
<v Speaker 3>they're Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously they call themselves </v>

884
00:43:05.131 --> 00:43:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in casual conversation they'd say,</v>

885
00:43:07.681 --> 00:43:09.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same Way.</v>

886
00:43:09.511 --> 00:43:12.540
<v Speaker 3>If you're a Italian blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

887
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.860
<v Speaker 3>you're two generations away from Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people still say,</v>

888
00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:17.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Italian.</v>

889
00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.980
<v Speaker 3>It's an understood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're also American.</v>

890
00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.083
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just have.</v>

891
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.153
<v Speaker 3>So he used me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used the language the way people use </v>

892
00:43:23.791 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

893
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.580
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so far he's not a racist.</v>

894
00:43:26.581 --> 00:43:28.170
<v Speaker 3>He just used the language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lay people do.</v>

895
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.810
<v Speaker 3>But he went further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that because of that,</v>

896
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.050
<v Speaker 3>you would be biased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you know who's biased.</v>

897
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Every fucking person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every person in the world is bias.</v>

898
00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.770
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as the unbiased </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

899
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.640
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that jury's pick,</v>

900
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:44.400
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

901
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.233
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers kick people off of Jerry's </v>

902
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.780
<v Speaker 3>because of their experience that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>biased.</v>

903
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.823
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason that a judge can recuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>himself or herself because they know </v>

904
00:43:53.041 --> 00:43:56.670
<v Speaker 3>they're biased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to imagine that someone who has,</v>

905
00:43:56.671 --> 00:44:00.900
<v Speaker 3>let's say a Mexican heritage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>presumably their relatives are Mexican,</v>

906
00:44:00.901 --> 00:44:03.060
<v Speaker 3>maybe he has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he's visited Mexico,</v>

907
00:44:03.061 --> 00:44:03.894
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the very least he's got a family </v>

908
00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:06.894
<v Speaker 3>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is more influential on your </v>

909
00:44:09.091 --> 00:44:09.924
<v Speaker 3>decision making than your family and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to live with them for the rest </v>

910
00:44:13.741 --> 00:44:14.574
<v Speaker 3>of your life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine this judge ruling inexplicably </v>

911
00:44:17.551 --> 00:44:22.530
<v Speaker 3>favorably for trump and then attending </v>
<v Speaker 3>this next family reunion right now.</v>

912
00:44:22.531 --> 00:44:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Remove Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter who it is.</v>

913
00:44:24.901 --> 00:44:25.734
<v Speaker 3>If this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this guy does something that's </v>

914
00:44:27.061 --> 00:44:29.850
<v Speaker 3>unpopular with his family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>

915
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the perfect for a human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget that is a judge.</v>

916
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:36.780
<v Speaker 3>Forget deals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heritage and human.</v>

917
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.170
<v Speaker 3>In that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was almost guaranteed to be biased.</v>

918
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a professional judge,</v>

919
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 3>can he see past that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his job,</v>

920
00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

921
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:47.993
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's still smart for trump to put </v>

922
00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:54.951
<v Speaker 3>that out there because he's persuading a</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal case and both,</v>

923
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 3>both sides are trying to persuade as </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard as they can.</v>

924
00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.430
<v Speaker 3>So trump is putting it out there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

925
00:44:59.431 --> 00:45:00.300
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

926
00:45:00.301 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 3>and he's also persuading the public in </v>
<v Speaker 3>advance.</v>

927
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:03.323
<v Speaker 3>If I get a bad judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say people in this </v>

928
00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 3>situation can be biased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I get a good judgment,</v>

929
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:14.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy I go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as he's not doing it as subtly as you</v>

930
00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:15.210
<v Speaker 3>just laid out saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

931
00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:19.350
<v Speaker 3>this guy might be biased in a calm way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You calmly laid it out.</v>

932
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.890
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes to the easier but that.</v>

933
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:23.080
<v Speaker 3>But you're saying that's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why he gets attached point.</v>

934
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets attention.</v>

935
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 3>So it's the attention on it that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>it powerful.</v>

936
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:27.803
<v Speaker 3>So if you were to pick this apart as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal strategy and pick the actual </v>

937
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:32.460
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there actually isn't any racism.</v>

938
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:36.330
<v Speaker 3>There is a comment about somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>has a race in this case,</v>

939
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:38.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a,</v>

940
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.123
<v Speaker 3>a cultural heritage is a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody is influenced by all </v>

941
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:46.320
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of their influences.</v>

942
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Family influences their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They worked at their pack,</v>

943
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.150
<v Speaker 3>their background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

944
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.133
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose the inherent problem with it </v>

945
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:54.924
<v Speaker 3>in that case is that had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had this judge been white of Irish </v>

946
00:45:58.441 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 3>descent or Italian descent or some other</v>
<v Speaker 3>European descent,</v>

947
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.790
<v Speaker 3>you acknowledged she would have certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>biases,</v>

948
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:10.791
<v Speaker 3>but trump would've never figured out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to bring up his ethnic background.</v>

949
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you an example right back to</v>

950
00:46:15.451 --> 00:46:16.284
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say trump is doing some business </v>

951
00:46:17.911 --> 00:46:19.320
<v Speaker 3>in Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he is.</v>

952
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:24.360
<v Speaker 3>Let's say the people in Scotland got </v>
<v Speaker 3>really mad at him and formed a partition</v>

953
00:46:24.361 --> 00:46:26.460
<v Speaker 3>and the people in Scotland just hated </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

954
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're doing this over that </v>

955
00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 3>golf course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

956
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 3>so let's say there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

957
00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a second generation Scottish judge.</v>

958
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.200
<v Speaker 3>I think even trump has some Scottish </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood.</v>

959
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

960
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.960
<v Speaker 3>So in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a Scottish judge who had Scottish,</v>

961
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:44.743
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents was involved and he knew that </v>

962
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 3>the Scottish parents living in Scotland </v>
<v Speaker 3>were really,</v>

963
00:46:49.531 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 3>really mad at trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

964
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.043
<v Speaker 3>Would it be fair to say that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scottish judge who was really an </v>

965
00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 3>American citizen with Scottish </v>
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>

966
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:58.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be biased?</v>

967
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

968
00:47:00.451 --> 00:47:02.280
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you know reasonable?</v>

969
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically you're just.</v>

970
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.270
<v Speaker 3>All you're doing really is just peeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>back the.</v>

971
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 3>You're showing the wizard behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>curtain here,</v>

972
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.470
<v Speaker 3>so more than anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

973
00:47:10.471 --> 00:47:11.304
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not defending the specifics of </v>

974
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:14.940
<v Speaker 3>what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

975
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.823
<v Speaker 3>This in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm doing is giving the listeners </v>

976
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 3>an example of what confirmation bias </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like.</v>

977
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.040
<v Speaker 3>When you heard the judge curial comment </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of context.</v>

978
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 3>It does sound like a racist statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you put it in its proper context,</v>

979
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:34.180
<v Speaker 3>that goes away and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 3>confirmation bias looks.</v>

980
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.430
<v Speaker 3>It looks just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

981
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you blame?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't.</v>

982
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Since you have a lot of blame in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

983
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:40.654
<v Speaker 2>but do you prescribe the symptom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump to just everything that has </v>

984
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:47.734
<v Speaker 2>transpired over the last 20 years just </v>
<v Speaker 2>are terrible media that doesn't </v>

985
00:47:51.701 --> 00:47:52.534
<v Speaker 2>challenge politicians are discourse </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crumbled to the point of just </v>

986
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 2>yelling racism at everybody are </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians who lie.</v>

987
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think trump is any bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger of a liar.</v>

988
00:48:01.451 --> 00:48:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Then Hillary is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's probably a bigger liar.</v>

989
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Everything being equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he lies in more of a,</v>

990
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.250
<v Speaker 2>in a more of a regular person way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that makes people freak out.</v>

991
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:10.203
<v Speaker 2>She lies in more of a policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it just all led up to him in a way </v>

992
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:14.350
<v Speaker 2>it seems kind of obvious.</v>

993
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

994
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.020
<v Speaker 3>we don't live in a single variable </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

995
00:48:18.021 --> 00:48:20.180
<v Speaker 3>so you needed everything to be the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

996
00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.630
<v Speaker 3>Plus trump and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the results you have,</v>

997
00:48:22.631 --> 00:48:23.464
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't remove one of the important </v>

998
00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:25.760
<v Speaker 3>variables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there were lots of them.</v>

999
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.880
<v Speaker 3>But I think the key variable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what I've been saying,</v>

1000
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:32.270
<v Speaker 3>is trump's skill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his skill at persuasion,</v>

1001
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.033
<v Speaker 3>that is the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could take a non </v>

1002
00:48:35.961 --> 00:48:36.794
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put them in this same world in 2016 and </v>

1003
00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:41.930
<v Speaker 3>say the world is crazy in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

1004
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.233
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could drop Kanye West </v>

1005
00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:46.634
<v Speaker 3>into there yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I've said he does have some </v>

1006
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.733
<v Speaker 3>really high persuasion skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't have some of the other </v>

1007
00:48:50.751 --> 00:48:52.130
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1008
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.220
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think trump's specific phenomenon.</v>

1009
00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1010
00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't sense full trump's support.</v>

1011
00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is that what you're not,</v>

1012
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.280
<v Speaker 3>you have support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1013
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I would never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never support the use of support</v>

1014
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:09.230
<v Speaker 2>in terms of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet at the same time,</v>

1015
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people think you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the biggest trump supporters</v>

1016
00:49:12.471 --> 00:49:16.280
<v Speaker 2>out there and it's really just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about his technique.</v>

1017
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an admirer of his technique.</v>

1018
00:49:18.851 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1019
00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:21.064
<v Speaker 3>unlike many people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very amused by his humor and his </v>

1020
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

1021
00:49:25.331 --> 00:49:26.164
<v Speaker 3>before we were filming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned you have a New York </v>

1022
00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:30.700
<v Speaker 3>background as do I from upstate New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>

1023
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 3>And I haven't talked to too many New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York people about this.</v>

1024
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to run this by you.</v>

1025
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I went to Suny Binghamton badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another piece of my news.</v>

1026
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Hartwick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

1027
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're practically neighbors.</v>

1028
00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wrong times.</v>

1029
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was I talking about?</v>

1030
00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Upstate New York?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Upstate New York.</v>

1031
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 3>So when trump talks in these ways that </v>
<v Speaker 3>offend the world,</v>

1032
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I as a New Yorker say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not offensive talk.</v>

1033
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Let's just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1034
00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 3>that's just how I talked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

1035
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:01.804
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I had to learn to </v>

1036
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:03.904
<v Speaker 3>change when I moved to California is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when I talked like New York people </v>

1037
00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:10.410
<v Speaker 3>talk upstate or city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1038
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:14.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a bluntness that is offensive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had to really work on that.</v>

1039
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.633
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an arrogance or a perceived </v>

1040
00:50:18.251 --> 00:50:22.600
<v Speaker 3>arrogance of New Yorkers because we talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly about things we're good at.</v>

1041
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.960
<v Speaker 3>We also talk honestly about the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're bad at,</v>

1042
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.210
<v Speaker 3>but that Kinda gets lost California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1043
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.050
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1044
00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:30.630
<v Speaker 3>you have a big ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1045
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at these things.</v>

1046
00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just like everybody.</v>

1047
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.770
<v Speaker 3>We're all good at something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're bad at something.</v>

1048
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 3>How was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How was that terrible?</v>

1049
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 3>But the things that New Yorkers do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1050
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:42.700
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to punch that guy.</v>

1051
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:43.583
<v Speaker 3>He knows he needs a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needs two bullets in the back of the </v>

1052
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1053
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:46.813
<v Speaker 3>I'll give him two in the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One on one of the head is just normal </v>

1054
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:50.500
<v Speaker 3>New York talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 3>But you see that and a context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

1056
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:57.510
<v Speaker 3>I think this is purely a trump mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that there's,</v>

1057
00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's somebody telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1058
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.670
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff doesn't sound the same.</v>

1059
00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.070
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as you leave the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you leave,</v>

1060
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:06.080
<v Speaker 3>your state really doesn't sound the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

1061
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:07.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because I was just telling </v>

1062
00:51:07.801 --> 00:51:10.290
<v Speaker 2>you I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I visited New York for the last 10 days.</v>

1063
00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I got back yesterday and even though I </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived there my whole life,</v>

1064
00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:14.304
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I really noticed </v>
<v Speaker 2>about being in New York City for for 10 </v>

1065
00:51:17.281 --> 00:51:19.440
<v Speaker 2>days was the incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1066
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:23.310
<v Speaker 2>racial mix and every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every type of person on earth is in that</v>

1067
00:51:23.311 --> 00:51:25.410
<v Speaker 2>city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on subways together.</v>

1068
00:51:25.411 --> 00:51:26.244
<v Speaker 2>We're not killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're pretty much just ignoring each </v>

1069
00:51:28.801 --> 00:51:31.320
<v Speaker 2>other because everyone's going to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives.</v>

1070
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.200
<v Speaker 2>And I thought there's something actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful about that.</v>

1071
00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.213
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter ultimately if keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people privately hate each other </v>

1072
00:51:38.491 --> 00:51:39.324
<v Speaker 2>for racist reasons or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're all out there living their </v>

1073
00:51:43.411 --> 00:51:44.244
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not to say there isn't any crime </v>

1074
00:51:45.211 --> 00:51:47.850
<v Speaker 2>or any bad racism or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1075
00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.240
<v Speaker 2>But I thought that was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiring about New York that we're told</v>

1076
00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.820
<v Speaker 2>we live in this society that's so frayed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything,</v>

1077
00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:56.070
<v Speaker 2>and yet our best city has everybody</v>

1078
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.430
<v Speaker 3>and we're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that example.</v>

1079
00:51:58.431 --> 00:51:59.970
<v Speaker 3>And to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1080
00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to steal something that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard Dr Laura say one,</v>

1081
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.520
<v Speaker 3>so I'm kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1082
00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:05.493
<v Speaker 3>maybe modifying the words a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll credit her for the thought and </v>

1083
00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:09.134
<v Speaker 3>the thought is that you are what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not what you think because if we </v>

1084
00:52:14.271 --> 00:52:17.800
<v Speaker 3>were judged by our thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would all be executed for,</v>

1085
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be killed for just the things</v>

1086
00:52:20.331 --> 00:52:21.240
<v Speaker 3>you were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1087
00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's coming.</v>

1088
00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are what you do.</v>

1089
00:52:24.591 --> 00:52:27.230
<v Speaker 3>And more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are what you do recently.</v>

1090
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Because if I'm judged by my past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got some problems.</v>

1091
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.000
<v Speaker 3>If you're judged by your past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've probably got some problems too.</v>

1092
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.330
<v Speaker 3>We were all in their twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ones,</v>

1093
00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:36.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>

1094
00:52:36.501 --> 00:52:38.340
<v Speaker 3>it's all bad stuff in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.450
<v Speaker 3>The goal of life is to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we're not,</v>

1096
00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.370
<v Speaker 3>if we're not improving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got a problem,</v>

1097
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:44.204
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think both Clinton and trump have </v>

1098
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:49.250
<v Speaker 3>probably improved and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>judging them,</v>

1099
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.173
<v Speaker 3>either one of them by something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in say 10 or more years ago is </v>

1100
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.733
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is probably a bad bet because we're all </v>

1101
00:52:57.951 --> 00:52:58.784
<v Speaker 3>bad people 10 years ago compared to how </v>
<v Speaker 3>we are now because ideally we're all </v>

1102
00:53:02.691 --> 00:53:03.630
<v Speaker 3>getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter,</v>

1103
00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better informed.</v>

1104
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Well the hope is by the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people do obviously,</v>

1105
00:53:07.241 --> 00:53:08.074
<v Speaker 2>but the other way too to</v>

1106
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.010
<v Speaker 3>so when people are judging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example of trump for his,</v>

1107
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:11.873
<v Speaker 3>let's say his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his recent focus on African Americans </v>

1108
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:20.340
<v Speaker 3>and say that's in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not thinking that.</v>

1109
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.980
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on the wrong page.</v>

1110
00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.093
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1111
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:25.103
<v Speaker 3>what counts is what he's doing and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was doing before it wasn't as good </v>

1112
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:30.120
<v Speaker 3>because he wasn't mentioning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1113
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:30.954
<v Speaker 3>other groups in society and now he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's gone from less good too good if </v>

1114
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 3>doing the right thing doesn't count </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

1115
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:38.970
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck.</v>

1116
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.570
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really fascinating.</v>

1117
00:53:41.571 --> 00:53:42.404
<v Speaker 2>So when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they take something like the </v>

1118
00:53:43.461 --> 00:53:45.830
<v Speaker 2>immigration thing where he said we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to kick them all out day one,</v>

1119
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:46.933
<v Speaker 2>then he tempered it this past week and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it sounds like he untempered it by </v>

1120
00:53:49.821 --> 00:53:50.301
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1121
00:53:50.301 --> 00:53:52.160
<v Speaker 2>first our in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to start or something.</v>

1122
00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Those are all crazy comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're not getting rid of everybody.</v>

1123
00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Then the temporary actually I thought it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounded somewhat sane and then I'm going</v>

1124
00:53:58.941 --> 00:54:01.850
<v Speaker 2>to do it in the first hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds completely insane at that point.</v>

1125
00:54:01.851 --> 00:54:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not crazy at all.</v>

1126
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1127
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:06.223
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's using the tools you're talking </v>

1128
00:54:07.851 --> 00:54:10.070
<v Speaker 2>about but is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I understand that,</v>

1129
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.113
<v Speaker 2>but is there anything that he could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that would turn off his </v>

1130
00:54:15.081 --> 00:54:19.880
<v Speaker 2>people because he immigration was their </v>
<v Speaker 2>number one thing and he pretty much.</v>

1131
00:54:19.881 --> 00:54:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean even Ann Coulter was </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledging it.</v>

1132
00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Like he backed off that because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying,</v>

1133
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I think to become better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to become a more legitimate candidate.</v>

1134
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he had to throw them under the bus.</v>

1135
00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who believed it,</v>

1136
00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.750
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would put it in these terms.</v>

1137
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.613
<v Speaker 3>In hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something called pacing and </v>

1138
00:54:38.451 --> 00:54:41.750
<v Speaker 3>leading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacing is when you match your subject in</v>

1139
00:54:41.751 --> 00:54:44.690
<v Speaker 3>any way you match their breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they talked,</v>

1140
00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.620
<v Speaker 3>the way their their posture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you do that long enough,</v>

1141
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:51.830
<v Speaker 3>people get comfortable with you and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do what's called leading,</v>

1142
00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.113
<v Speaker 3>so then you then you can do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>different and then people will start </v>

1143
00:54:56.541 --> 00:54:57.374
<v Speaker 3>doing the thing that you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you start by copying them until they </v>

1144
00:55:00.681 --> 00:55:02.690
<v Speaker 3>learn to copy you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Subconsciously.</v>

1145
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.290
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing it intentionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

1146
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:05.303
<v Speaker 3>it's a major.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the biggest components of </v>

1147
00:55:07.341 --> 00:55:08.174
<v Speaker 3>hypnosis is that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What trump is doing is pacing and </v>

1148
00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:12.074
<v Speaker 3>leading the entire Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you think he's doing is that he's </v>

1149
00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:19.580
<v Speaker 3>gone in and his ideas are a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>different and somehow with his,</v>

1150
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's punched his way through the top.</v>

1151
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:26.270
<v Speaker 3>That is not what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hollowed out the gop and he's wearing</v>

1152
00:55:26.271 --> 00:55:29.810
<v Speaker 3>it as a skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he's done,</v>

1153
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:32.180
<v Speaker 3>the Republican Party will never be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

1154
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:34.970
<v Speaker 3>He has changed it and he has improved </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1155
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.193
<v Speaker 3>He got in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got onstage at the Republican </v>

1156
00:55:38.871 --> 00:55:39.704
<v Speaker 3>convention and did a full throated what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought was completely sincere </v>

1157
00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:48.410
<v Speaker 3>endorsement of doing more to help the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lbgtq community.</v>

1158
00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:49.813
<v Speaker 3>Peter Teal spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He meant it and what happened with all </v>

1159
00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:56.750
<v Speaker 3>the Republicans as soon as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as he did that,</v>

1160
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:59.420
<v Speaker 3>you don't hear anybody complaining about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1161
00:55:59.421 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1162
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:01.730
<v Speaker 3>and not that they would have complained </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily,</v>

1163
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:02.803
<v Speaker 3>but the Republican party changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump changed them and they can't go </v>

1164
00:56:06.921 --> 00:56:07.754
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1165
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.030
<v Speaker 3>he pays them until he led them and on </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigration.</v>

1166
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.133
<v Speaker 3>He pays them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said what they needed to hear until </v>

1167
00:56:14.001 --> 00:56:15.170
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

1168
00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:15.860
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

1169
00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.570
<v Speaker 3>He's our guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel good with you.</v>

1170
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Now he's in a position to lead the repo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the democratic side.</v>

1171
00:56:22.551 --> 00:56:23.650
<v Speaker 3>There were already there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1172
00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 3>they wanted something kinder and gentler</v>
<v Speaker 3>going by the wayside.</v>

1173
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Why don't want this to be dealt with in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most humane way.</v>

1174
00:56:29.951 --> 00:56:34.450
<v Speaker 3>That also makes sense from the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

1175
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:35.343
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but slightly different than Nixon goes </v>

1176
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:38.860
<v Speaker 3>to China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1177
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Nixon was a hard ass about China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he went there,</v>

1178
00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.150
<v Speaker 3>people believed him that he wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling out,</v>

1179
00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.013
<v Speaker 3>he was still Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People believe that trump is still </v>

1180
00:56:46.931 --> 00:56:47.764
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if he sold them that he had their </v>

1181
00:56:49.871 --> 00:56:51.970
<v Speaker 3>interests in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he totally did.</v>

1182
00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.040
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For his Republican base,</v>

1183
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.470
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear you about this immigration.</v>

1184
00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make it my top priority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He paced them,</v>

1185
00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 3>they trusted him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got into side.</v>

1186
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Now trump and nobody else can soften </v>
<v Speaker 3>that position.</v>

1187
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:09.460
<v Speaker 3>No one else is in that position because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the way he did it.</v>

1188
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.890
<v Speaker 3>But it looks to the public like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>flip flop.</v>

1189
00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.380
<v Speaker 3>It's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1190
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.223
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1191
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it was intentional from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>

1192
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1193
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:17.950
<v Speaker 2>so you would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1194
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:18.873
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of people that after Peter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Teal spoke and trump had that nice </v>

1195
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:25.460
<v Speaker 2>moment actually where he said the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about lgbt Americans and he got a,</v>

1196
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:26.703
<v Speaker 2>what I think was a pretty spontaneous </v>
<v Speaker 2>applause break from the crowd based </v>

1197
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1198
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:32.103
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1199
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:32.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that a lot of people after that </v>

1200
00:57:33.761 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 2>we're saying we'll still look what's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the party platform.</v>

1201
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And there's still stuff that's not great</v>
<v Speaker 2>on marriage equality and other things,</v>

1202
00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:39.963
<v Speaker 2>but you would argue that's basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant at this point because he's </v>

1203
00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:44.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the head,</v>

1204
00:57:44.351 --> 00:57:47.090
<v Speaker 2>he's the leader and he's made the </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledgement so.</v>

1205
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not done.</v>

1206
00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1207
00:57:49.171 --> 00:57:50.670
<v Speaker 3>everything's a work in progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1208
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:51.983
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1209
00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I think trump's support of the lgbt Q,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lose a bunch of ladders.</v>

1210
00:57:57.001 --> 00:58:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Community was both sincere and a higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>priority than the wedding cakes.</v>

1211
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.160
<v Speaker 3>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the wedding cakes will be okay.</v>

1212
00:58:05.161 --> 00:58:05.880
<v Speaker 3>And the weddings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1213
00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.590
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the Republican Party will,</v>

1214
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:09.270
<v Speaker 3>will catch up in that sense.</v>

1215
00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:10.163
<v Speaker 2>So is that the irony?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate irony of trump more than </v>

1216
00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:12.654
<v Speaker 2>anything else is that while these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>get shaky when you're talking to them </v>

1217
00:58:15.511 --> 00:58:17.880
<v Speaker 2>and angry and stammering and sweaty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff,</v>

1218
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:19.223
<v Speaker 2>that he actually became the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>nominee by basically being pro gay </v>

1219
00:58:24.541 --> 00:58:25.374
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to try to flip gay </v>

1220
00:58:26.101 --> 00:58:26.934
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's for gay people to live equally </v>

1221
00:58:29.071 --> 00:58:29.904
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time he's been running </v>

1222
00:58:31.051 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 2>an antiwar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He certainly doesn't want a nation build</v>

1223
00:58:33.961 --> 00:58:34.794
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants people that were giving things </v>

1224
00:58:37.201 --> 00:58:39.090
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay us all of that stuff.</v>

1225
00:58:39.091 --> 00:58:39.924
<v Speaker 2>So he actually sort of killed the Neo </v>
<v Speaker 2>con part of it and killed the Christian </v>

1226
00:58:44.311 --> 00:58:46.800
<v Speaker 2>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he slayed them both on the way.</v>

1227
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:47.803
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should've become the left's favorite </v>

1228
00:58:49.321 --> 00:58:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Republican in a bizarre way.</v>

1229
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe still.</v>

1230
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.591
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1231
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm still predicting that he'll win in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>landslide.</v>

1232
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.333
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the polls don't look like that </v>

1233
00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.610
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're tightening as we're talking.</v>

1234
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:02.883
<v Speaker 2>How much of that do you think is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a certain fear of saying </v>

1235
00:59:05.081 --> 00:59:05.914
<v Speaker 2>you're for trump</v>

1236
00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.940
<v Speaker 3>so people don't fall properly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably a lot of it.</v>

1237
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:10.023
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people who say they're </v>

1238
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:13.043
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they won't say out loud that they </v>

1239
00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:16.050
<v Speaker 3>support trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1240
00:59:16.051 --> 00:59:19.650
<v Speaker 3>because since I said that I support </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton for my personal safety.</v>

1241
00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:20.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get to that because I live in </v>

1242
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 2>California</v>

1243
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:24.920
<v Speaker 3>where that's kind of important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1244
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.593
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard from people who say the same </v>

1245
00:59:28.491 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

1246
00:59:29.481 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say it at work.</v>

1247
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I can't say it to my family who can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>say it to my friends.</v>

1248
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:34.543
<v Speaker 3>How many there are is the great mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think they're being picked </v>

1249
00:59:38.181 --> 00:59:39.950
<v Speaker 3>up and pulling necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1250
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.130
<v Speaker 3>What do you make of the alt right that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's talking about right now?</v>

1251
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you consider yourself part</v>

1252
00:59:45.711 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're sort of a do not.</v>

1253
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.013
<v Speaker 3>You're a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a parcel to it or something like </v>

1254
00:59:49.701 --> 00:59:50.151
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1255
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:50.984
<v Speaker 3>Like because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting two or something like </v>

1256
00:59:52.581 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they are getting,</v>

1257
00:59:53.481 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the techniques that they</v>

1258
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:59.890
<v Speaker 3>are doing of upsetting people in power </v>
<v Speaker 3>with memes,</v>

1259
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 3>you know you have so nobody in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basement,</v>

1260
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:04.400
<v Speaker 3>they send out a Nazi meme to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1261
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.233
<v Speaker 3>That person retweets it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thus you're showing that you're </v>

1262
01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 3>upsetting them and you're changing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game from your basement.</v>

1263
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Like some of that seems like the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're talking about.</v>

1264
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.963
<v Speaker 3>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I disavowed the alternative as I see </v>

1265
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:17.991
<v Speaker 3>what I've done here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1266
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 3>you spy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you endorsed trump thing.</v>

1267
01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:20.744
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting you in a disavowed trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I disavow everybody's going to Hillary </v>

1268
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Clinton because that's best for my </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal safety.</v>

1269
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what they all were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1270
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:32.930
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1271
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.830
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even is it,</v>

1272
01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:35.683
<v Speaker 3>isn't it like a grab bag of </v>
<v Speaker 3>miscellaneous things that other people </v>

1273
01:00:38.751 --> 01:00:39.584
<v Speaker 3>don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty much what I described at </v>

1274
01:00:41.811 --> 01:00:45.980
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of this is polite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't like it.</v>

1275
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:50.520
<v Speaker 3>It's him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not sure how one can,</v>

1276
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:53.630
<v Speaker 3>can love that movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly is having an impact.</v>

1277
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's using the techniques you're </v>

1278
01:00:55.491 --> 01:00:56.420
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1279
01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Like they're doing a lot of the leads </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1280
01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:01.280
<v Speaker 3>They're upsetting people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Empower everybody's using the techniques</v>

1281
01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.990
<v Speaker 3>we're using better than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than others.</v>

1282
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yes,</v>

1283
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I would say that I've observed them </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally trying to use the power of</v>

1284
01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 3>the tools of persuasion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but both sides are doing that now.</v>

1285
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious because you've become so big</v>

1286
01:01:15.231 --> 01:01:17.600
<v Speaker 3>on twitter and you have your base on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter that,</v>

1287
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:18.463
<v Speaker 3>that absolutely loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever find that they're leading </v>

1288
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:21.554
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever find that you were about to </v>

1289
01:01:22.401 --> 01:01:24.290
<v Speaker 3>tweet something and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1290
01:01:24.291 --> 01:01:25.124
<v Speaker 3>this could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this could upset them or they'll get </v>

1291
01:01:26.991 --> 01:01:29.010
<v Speaker 3>confused or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or as someone that's,</v>

1292
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:29.893
<v Speaker 3>that's a writer and that's able to get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought out in a six panel cartoon that </v>

1293
01:01:34.131 --> 01:01:38.030
<v Speaker 3>twitter has some drawbacks when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to really formulate a thought.</v>

1294
01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:40.550
<v Speaker 3>All communication has drawbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I definitely,</v>

1295
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.433
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely informed by who is </v>

1296
01:01:43.641 --> 01:01:48.641
<v Speaker 3>reading my tweets to keep them in a zone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense for the followers.</v>

1297
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.250
<v Speaker 3>But beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big proponent of free speech,</v>

1298
01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:55.160
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna mute </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

1299
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1300
01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I have what I lovingly recall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you money.</v>

1301
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:05.010
<v Speaker 3>So I don't have a boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to.</v>

1302
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:05.923
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to make other people happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I have something that needs to be </v>

1303
01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:08.660
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do that.</v>

1304
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to tell me the number.</v>

1305
01:02:10.011 --> 01:02:11.780
<v Speaker 3>But when did you realize you had fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>you money?</v>

1306
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago probably.</v>

1307
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:16.783
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's do a little bit on hillary </v>

1308
01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:19.160
<v Speaker 3>because we kind of danced around her a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1309
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

1310
01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:22.350
<v Speaker 2>sort of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all encompassing.</v>

1311
01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top trump,</v>

1312
01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of talking hillary already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just stuck in this thing.</v>

1313
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of her?</v>

1314
01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:28.914
<v Speaker 2>Do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems just uninspiring to me and I </v>

1315
01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:36.321
<v Speaker 2>consider her as much of a liar as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider trump and we're just screwed.</v>

1316
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.910
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that for a lead?</v>

1317
01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.513
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you at this point in the race </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to vote for the one </v>

1318
01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:46.340
<v Speaker 3>who's not the liar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>

1319
01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a,</v>

1320
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.963
<v Speaker 3>there was a point early on in the race </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you could say trump is lying way </v>

1321
01:02:53.511 --> 01:02:54.344
<v Speaker 3>more than Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that difference has been </v>

1322
01:02:56.091 --> 01:02:58.880
<v Speaker 3>erased and the reason is that lying </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked really,</v>

1323
01:02:58.881 --> 01:03:01.550
<v Speaker 3>really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so Clinton is sort of,</v>

1324
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:03.840
<v Speaker 3>as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dispense with the facts that.</v>

1325
01:03:03.841 --> 01:03:07.180
<v Speaker 3>And she's more about a user are racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>and misogynist.</v>

1326
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:08.690
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I've said,</v>

1327
01:03:08.691 --> 01:03:11.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that's confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fact,</v>

1328
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:15.460
<v Speaker 3>but the race has almost entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it,</v>

1329
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:17.210
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen this before.</v>

1330
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.433
<v Speaker 3>The race has gone from talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies and things in the world to </v>

1331
01:03:22.941 --> 01:03:23.774
<v Speaker 3>almost entirely talking about this gray </v>
<v Speaker 3>lump of matter in each of their heads </v>

1332
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:29.370
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1333
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.130
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1334
01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:33.650
<v Speaker 3>is Hillary's sick or lying or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>is trump,</v>

1335
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:34.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crazy,</v>

1336
01:03:34.581 --> 01:03:36.080
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>misogynist or whatever,</v>

1337
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:38.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's all about the gray thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their skull.</v>

1338
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about the world?</v>

1339
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was that the obvious outcome here?</v>

1340
01:03:43.421 --> 01:03:44.460
<v Speaker 2>In a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1341
01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.070
<v Speaker 2>if you go back six months and you really</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw what was going to happen here,</v>

1342
01:03:48.071 --> 01:03:48.904
<v Speaker 2>and you look at Hillary and Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually they were gonna take him down </v>

1343
01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:53.890
<v Speaker 2>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you saw what trump was building,</v>

1344
01:03:53.891 --> 01:03:54.724
<v Speaker 2>which as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw it a little earlier than most </v>

1345
01:03:56.411 --> 01:03:57.490
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way,</v>

1346
01:03:57.491 --> 01:04:00.100
<v Speaker 2>this was the obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were going to get to this,</v>

1347
01:04:00.101 --> 01:04:01.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what,</v>

1348
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.480
<v Speaker 3>probably the gravity was sucking us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this place.</v>

1349
01:04:05.481 --> 01:04:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1350
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:09.680
<v Speaker 3>the only unknown was whether Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 3>would go as dark as she went.</v>

1351
01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:13.040
<v Speaker 3>By the way that were dark probably came </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Godzilla.</v>

1352
01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1353
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:15.303
<v Speaker 3>that's an engineered word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the word that you don't hear in </v>

1354
01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:18.194
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is designed to attract </v>

1355
01:04:19.821 --> 01:04:21.020
<v Speaker 3>confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1356
01:04:21.021 --> 01:04:22.820
<v Speaker 3>everything trump is doing is dark now</v>

1357
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.460
<v Speaker 2>for people that missed the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that clip.</v>

1358
01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the guy's name again?</v>

1359
01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that would be Robert Cialdini.</v>

1360
01:04:29.821 --> 01:04:30.654
<v Speaker 3>I'm just hypothesizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have confirmation that he's </v>

1361
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 3>working on the Clinton campaign advising</v>
<v Speaker 3>her in the persuasion arts.</v>

1362
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1363
01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:41.010
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's put trump and Clinton aside for</v>

1364
01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:41.844
<v Speaker 2>a second and I want to finish up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech because that's sort of in </v>

1365
01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:44.964
<v Speaker 2>the thrust of everything that I do here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know it's something that's </v>

1366
01:04:46.921 --> 01:04:49.150
<v Speaker 2>obviously very important to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1367
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:53.190
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of the state of free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech in America in 2016 as a,</v>

1368
01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:54.024
<v Speaker 2>as a creator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone that puts thoughts out there </v>

1369
01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:56.963
<v Speaker 2>and you do poke funded a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>societal nonsensical ways that we self </v>

1370
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:02.630
<v Speaker 2>censor.</v>

1371
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:03.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1372
01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.163
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting in many ways the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going in the same direction in the </v>

1373
01:05:08.211 --> 01:05:11.150
<v Speaker 3>sense that there's more of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1374
01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.013
<v Speaker 3>I think in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of something less of something </v>

1375
01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:15.344
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now there are more places that you </v>

1376
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.660
<v Speaker 3>speak with complete freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1377
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:20.583
<v Speaker 3>online and then there are fewer places </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could do the same thing in </v>

1378
01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:24.964
<v Speaker 3>corporate America or in other places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in some ways there's more freedom </v>

1379
01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:31.500
<v Speaker 3>than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a whole lot of places in,</v>

1380
01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.850
<v Speaker 3>in troubling ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's less than ever.</v>

1381
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:35.703
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little on the fence about how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that is bad and how much of it is </v>

1382
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:45.280
<v Speaker 3>good because I do think that words </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

1383
01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:47.570
<v Speaker 3>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1384
01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:48.663
<v Speaker 3>there are places where civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation is more important than say </v>

1385
01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:53.710
<v Speaker 3>in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1386
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:58.000
<v Speaker 3>For freedom of speech is overrated in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some contexts,</v>

1387
01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.133
<v Speaker 3>but you certainly have to have it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an effective government and an </v>

1388
01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:02.194
<v Speaker 3>effective country.</v>

1389
01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to that end,</v>

1390
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 3>do you say Asana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing it back to trump,</v>

1391
01:06:05.891 --> 01:06:07.110
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to,</v>

1392
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 3>for the purposes of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that once in office,</v>

1393
01:06:10.151 --> 01:06:10.984
<v Speaker 3>if he became president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think he'd be able to have those </v>

1394
01:06:13.361 --> 01:06:14.194
<v Speaker 3>conversations in that sort of space </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's not doing these all these </v>

1395
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 3>tricks but doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect your,</v>

1396
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.033
<v Speaker 3>these?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1397
01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:23.143
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you imagine a president </v>

1398
01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:25.530
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1399
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:29.200
<v Speaker 3>I could see two things happening once </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody moderates,</v>

1400
01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:32.380
<v Speaker 3>once they get the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember back in my corporate days,</v>

1401
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:33.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:34.103
<v Speaker 3>one of my coworkers would get promoted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to an important level of responsibility </v>

1403
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 3>and their personality would just change </v>
<v Speaker 3>overnight.</v>

1404
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 3>It started getting serious and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would stop joking around.</v>

1405
01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Certainly trump would be doing some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1406
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:46.323
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there would be some moderation just </v>

1407
01:06:47.171 --> 01:06:50.590
<v Speaker 3>because the job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine just imagine yourself,</v>

1408
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1409
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:54.850
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you're thinking before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you walk into the Oval Office,</v>

1410
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:55.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1411
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:58.840
<v Speaker 3>You walk into the Oval Office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the White House,</v>

1412
01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:01.570
<v Speaker 3>all right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way that doesn't change.</v>

1413
01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.570
<v Speaker 3>It's real now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

1414
01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.740
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest influence you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

1415
01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.930
<v Speaker 3>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Chilean even writes about this,</v>

1416
01:07:07.931 --> 01:07:11.470
<v Speaker 3>the influence of your physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment in his new book,</v>

1417
01:07:11.471 --> 01:07:12.560
<v Speaker 3>which I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll plug for them.</v>

1418
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Presuasion predestination will be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest book about persuasion.</v>

1419
01:07:18.221 --> 01:07:20.440
<v Speaker 3>The world's ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be massive.</v>

1420
01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:22.420
<v Speaker 3>I got an early copy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I saw,</v>

1421
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1422
01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:26.430
<v Speaker 3>so trouble moderate just because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>

1423
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:28.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power of the office,</v>

1424
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:33.730
<v Speaker 3>but also he's also created in </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's mind and expectation that he</v>

1425
01:07:33.731 --> 01:07:36.400
<v Speaker 3>does things that other people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're,</v>

1426
01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:41.200
<v Speaker 3>let's say you know that the heads of </v>
<v Speaker 3>China or Russia and trump says,</v>

1427
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crazy thing that people don't normally</v>

1428
01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:44.980
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to say,</v>

1429
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.810
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here it comes to the nukes.</v>

1430
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.083
<v Speaker 3>They're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to say that's what he </v>

1431
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:49.650
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

1432
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to stop thinking that China's</v>

1433
01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:52.533
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to misconstrue what's </v>

1434
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 3>happening over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could not be more clear.</v>

1435
01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:59.920
<v Speaker 3>The trump says things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other people that would say.</v>

1436
01:07:59.921 --> 01:08:02.230
<v Speaker 3>So if he does more of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna say,</v>

1437
01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:03.064
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more of it.</v>

1438
01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:04.043
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically they would just have to </v>

1439
01:08:05.351 --> 01:08:10.150
<v Speaker 3>learn how to readjust already have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that process is done,</v>

1440
01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:11.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to see enough of him to </v>

1441
01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:13.330
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1442
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:18.331
<v Speaker 3>he's talking like I'm going to say a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we get that.</v>

1443
01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get the that that's his style,</v>

1444
01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:22.070
<v Speaker 3>you're okay with it.</v>

1445
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting what you said </v>

1446
01:08:23.511 --> 01:08:24.344
<v Speaker 2>about how so in some ways it feels like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have less free speech and in some </v>

1447
01:08:27.831 --> 01:08:28.664
<v Speaker 2>ways it feels like we have more because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people will now use the internet to do </v>

1448
01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

1449
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:33.833
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little caught between feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet side of it is good and bad </v>

1450
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:39.650
<v Speaker 2>because so many people are doing it at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1451
01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:40.484
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm buried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're exercising their right to free </v>

1452
01:08:43.971 --> 01:08:44.804
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it also comes with you say all </v>

1453
01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:50.870
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things that you would never say</v>
<v Speaker 2>in person.</v>

1454
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.530
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem with what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I say all the time that the show,</v>

1455
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:54.383
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the Nazi memes and showing </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these rays actual racist things </v>

1456
01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:02.030
<v Speaker 2>about black people or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't stop them from doing it,</v>

1457
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess,</v>

1458
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.353
<v Speaker 2>but still you would say that's a net </v>
<v Speaker 2>good because at least there's the </v>

1459
01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:08.144
<v Speaker 2>outlet.</v>

1460
01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1461
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:14.310
<v Speaker 3>I would say that anonymity is essential </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a free society.</v>

1462
01:09:14.311 --> 01:09:17.130
<v Speaker 3>You got to be able to say some things </v>
<v Speaker 3>anonymously,</v>

1463
01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.713
<v Speaker 3>but I'd also say that the cure for all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad stuff is sunlight and the more </v>

1464
01:09:24.631 --> 01:09:27.360
<v Speaker 3>of the anonymous people say horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1465
01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.460
<v Speaker 3>the more of the sunlight starts to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1466
01:09:30.461 --> 01:09:33.990
<v Speaker 3>eroded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think you have to let it out before</v>

1467
01:09:33.991 --> 01:09:35.310
<v Speaker 3>you can kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1468
01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.450
<v Speaker 2>So to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>

1469
01:09:37.451 --> 01:09:38.284
<v Speaker 2>if someone was tweeting you all day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sending you awful Nazi memes or any of </v>

1470
01:09:41.861 --> 01:09:46.780
<v Speaker 2>this made my entire day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said my policy is I just ignore them.</v>

1471
01:09:46.781 --> 01:09:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally I mute them and on a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rare occasion if they just won't stop,</v>

1472
01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:52.140
<v Speaker 2>then I'll block them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1473
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:55.150
<v Speaker 2>but I never amplify them because I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1474
01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:55.984
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't really pretend that they're </v>

1475
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:59.380
<v Speaker 2>here then unless they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1476
01:09:59.381 --> 01:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not outside with </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitchforks,</v>

1477
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:03.400
<v Speaker 2>they're just doing it from the comfort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their own computer.</v>

1478
01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:04.563
<v Speaker 2>Do you basically think that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good policy and in this way because </v>

1479
01:10:08.111 --> 01:10:10.660
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I feel like we're just making </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ideas bigger if every time,</v>

1480
01:10:10.661 --> 01:10:11.494
<v Speaker 2>if I get outraged that they sent me </v>
<v Speaker 2>something upsetting and then I outrage </v>

1481
01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:17.890
<v Speaker 2>somebody else by retweeting it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes this never ending thing.</v>

1482
01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.753
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm judging everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>individually because every once in a </v>

1483
01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:23.920
<v Speaker 3>while they'll say something that links </v>
<v Speaker 3>to some data.</v>

1484
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now look at that and say that's data</v>

1485
01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.100
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't.</v>

1486
01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:28.983
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I don't like where their </v>
<v Speaker 3>implication or where it heads or or any </v>

1487
01:10:31.931 --> 01:10:32.764
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but data is data so those I tend to let </v>

1488
01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:38.870
<v Speaker 3>stay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if somebody just comes on and yelled</v>

1489
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:42.100
<v Speaker 3>some racial stuff that I usually just </v>
<v Speaker 3>block them right away.</v>

1490
01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1491
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:43.750
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Final thought.</v>

1492
01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:44.980
<v Speaker 2>You've already predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

1493
01:10:44.981 --> 01:10:48.640
<v Speaker 2>you're predicting a trump landslide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to give you some percentages</v>

1494
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:50.590
<v Speaker 2>but you want to put yourself out there</v>

1495
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:51.583
<v Speaker 3>that I said some from last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>98 percent trump landslide and hasn't </v>

1496
01:10:55.531 --> 01:10:56.364
<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What has changed is that he's had </v>

1497
01:10:57.781 --> 01:11:02.010
<v Speaker 3>terrible weeks and if that week was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only thing that happened until the end,</v>

1498
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:04.500
<v Speaker 3>of course he would lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that never stays the same.</v>

1499
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.713
<v Speaker 3>That weeks are going to be up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are some big shocks to </v>

1500
01:11:08.071 --> 01:11:08.904
<v Speaker 3>come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that all the trump shocks are </v>

1501
01:11:10.591 --> 01:11:11.424
<v Speaker 3>baked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's almost nothing you could hear </v>

1502
01:11:12.841 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 3>about unless it was totally out of left </v>
<v Speaker 3>field that would make any difference.</v>

1503
01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.004
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a whole bunch of stuff you </v>

1504
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:20.070
<v Speaker 3>could hear about Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1505
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 3>especially since she has government </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

1506
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1507
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.923
<v Speaker 3>that makes them more vulnerable to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shock because if he did it in the </v>

1508
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:27.840
<v Speaker 3>context of the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems worse.</v>

1509
01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:29.653
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that alone I think almost guarantees </v>

1510
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.273
<v Speaker 3>a trump victory really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically that wiki leaks could just </v>

1511
01:11:34.651 --> 01:11:36.900
<v Speaker 3>drop something because we know they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>holding something.</v>

1512
01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even have to be wiki leaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be anything.</v>

1513
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:41.490
<v Speaker 3>It could be anything A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1514
01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:42.324
<v Speaker 3>I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm glad we were able to talk about </v>

1515
01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:45.324
<v Speaker 3>some of this stuff without sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>craziness attached to it because it </v>

1516
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.640
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it feel like it's just crazy all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1517
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy in the most entertaining ways.</v>

1518
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.290
<v Speaker 3>I have never had more fun year of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1519
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:56.543
<v Speaker 3>I got to say I wake up every happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the news is going to entertain </v>

1520
01:11:59.551 --> 01:12:01.060
<v Speaker 3>me and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1521
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.430
<v Speaker 3>and people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are.</v>

1522
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.930
<v Speaker 3>People are engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Engagement,</v>

1523
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:06.803
<v Speaker 3>the engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1524
01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:07.763
<v Speaker 3>look what people learned about their </v>
<v Speaker 3>government this year about how the </v>

1525
01:12:10.501 --> 01:12:11.760
<v Speaker 3>primaries work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1526
01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:12.594
<v Speaker 3>that they are rigged a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just the level of human </v>

1527
01:12:16.351 --> 01:12:17.184
<v Speaker 3>engagement is off the chart and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>go so far as to say that a president </v>

1528
01:12:20.491 --> 01:12:21.324
<v Speaker 3>trump would probably encourage more </v>
<v Speaker 3>direct public participation because it </v>

1529
01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:29.460
<v Speaker 3>just feels like he needs it.</v>

1530
01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.610
<v Speaker 3>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was because he just loves it.</v>

1531
01:12:32.611 --> 01:12:33.660
<v Speaker 3>He loves that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1532
01:12:33.661 --> 01:12:34.494
<v Speaker 3>I think Clinton would do her thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>her lobbyists would writer write </v>

1533
01:12:37.411 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 3>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like always,</v>

1534
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:40.283
<v Speaker 3>but if you saw president trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd think almost anything was </v>

1535
01:12:41.881 --> 01:12:43.440
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'd say,</v>

1536
01:12:43.441 --> 01:12:44.274
<v Speaker 3>I got an idea and people are already </v>
<v Speaker 3>sending me all these ideas for building </v>

1537
01:12:47.191 --> 01:12:48.024
<v Speaker 3>the border wall with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a light rail train on the top and </v>

1538
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:52.920
<v Speaker 3>businesses and casinos and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1539
01:12:52.921 --> 01:12:53.754
<v Speaker 3>making it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1540
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:55.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic zone,</v>

1541
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.100
<v Speaker 3>good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're here,</v>

1542
01:12:56.101 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 3>we're hearing all this big thinking on </v>
<v Speaker 3>one side and I,</v>

1543
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:02.850
<v Speaker 3>I feel like something's being unleashed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a good way.</v>

1544
01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Like a creative thing and we hope it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the,</v>

1545
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:09.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of a race war.</v>

1546
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Out World War three.</v>
