<v Speaker 1>So first can you just tell me a little </v>

13
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>bit about the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you guys got started and how you</v>

14
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 2>personally got involved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

15
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:53.934
<v Speaker 2>we got started in 1999 with a professor </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Penn and a civil liberties lawyer in </v>

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 2>they both decided that there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 2>there was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an epidemic at our colleges.</v>

19
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 2>And Universities of the core individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights that,</v>

20
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 2>that make up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

21
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our constitution,</v>

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.840
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

23
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 2>as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as people,</v>

24
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.620
<v Speaker 2>as citizens of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Brent being respected on campuses across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country</v>

26
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>back in [inaudible] 99.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did nine.</v>

27
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because a lot of </v>

28
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>people say this is just the totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent phenomenon.</v>

29
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.661
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.494
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it that there is the political </v>

31
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>correctness movement to the eighties and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>

32
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

33
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.000
<v Speaker 2>that might've had something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

34
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 2>but this has been a problem since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech movement back at Berkeley.</v>

35
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:41.771
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:43.900
<v Speaker 2>long before even the eighties or </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>

37
00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:44.734
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>censorship is an age old problem that </v>

38
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 2>predates the United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

39
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.103
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as Alan and harvey went about </v>

40
00:01:55.721 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 2>creating fire and they decided to locate</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and like located in Philadelphia,</v>

41
00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:01.084
<v Speaker 2>which is the birthplace of our nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really got an outpouring of people </v>

42
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:07.301
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

43
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 2>this happened to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

44
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

45
00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:10.714
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

46
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.090
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an epidemic.</v>

47
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 2>We need to fix it and fire was born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

48
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:16.511
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or lit,</v>

49
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

50
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 2>over the years getting close to 20 now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy enough,</v>

51
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has actually just gone up every </v>

52
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 2>year more and more people reach out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire for help.</v>

53
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.343
<v Speaker 2>When I got to fire for the second time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually was a legal fellow with fire </v>

54
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 2>after I graduated from law school before</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started in private practice,</v>

55
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.443
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I came back in 2013 getting </v>

56
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.340
<v Speaker 2>several hundred case submissions a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

57
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 2>and now we are getting damn near close </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a thousand a year,</v>

58
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.523
<v Speaker 2>a credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just the stuff that we hear </v>

59
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.214
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine how much other stuff </v>

60
00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:56.974
<v Speaker 2>is going on around the country for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't know that we're out </v>

61
00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 2>there to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

62
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.883
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who perhaps go about it </v>

63
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:04.130
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

64
00:03:04.131 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy to think about how much is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

65
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk about some of those </v>

66
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>cases and some of the specific work that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>

67
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 2>but foundation for individual rights in </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

68
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.703
<v Speaker 2>I am a believer right now partly because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Kanye West and because of a lot of </v>

69
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 2>people online right now that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual is making a comeback that the</v>

70
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.114
<v Speaker 2>idea of the individual versus the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective is actually making a </v>

71
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 2>comeback.</v>

72
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.763
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any idea when they came up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a name for firewire was so </v>

73
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 2>important to put the individual front </v>
<v Speaker 2>and center?</v>

74
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.533
<v Speaker 2>and I'm speaking out of some level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance because I haven't actually </v>

76
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>discussed this with either of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

77
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to guess,</v>

78
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 2>it's because the individual qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the freedom of conscious,</v>

79
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.490
<v Speaker 2>the freedom of speech for things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow us to participate in society.</v>

80
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>We don't get to the collective unless we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the individuals.</v>

81
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.163
<v Speaker 2>One is necessary to have the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what is a collective other than </v>

82
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.410
<v Speaker 2>a group of individuals and consensus is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of individual opinions.</v>

83
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.553
<v Speaker 2>That throughout the process of winnowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and debating different good ideas and </v>

84
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>bad ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we reach a common understanding.</v>

85
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>We reach a a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.153
<v Speaker 2>a norm for society and that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why free speech particularly is </v>

87
00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 2>so important is because that's how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the optimal resolution,</v>

88
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.124
<v Speaker 2>the optimal conclusions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we reach these communal </v>

89
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 2>positions is only through our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal expressions of what we believe,</v>

90
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:39.214
<v Speaker 2>which exposes us to criticism or </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements or just flat out discussion </v>

91
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:43.384
<v Speaker 2>with other people.</v>

92
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.253
<v Speaker 2>So how do you think the ideas of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective took root so much a college </v>

93
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 2>campus then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

94
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.733
<v Speaker 2>I think there's the given take in </v>
<v Speaker 2>society at large that we really go </v>

95
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:56.404
<v Speaker 2>through every once in a while in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thinking about things as </v>

96
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.593
<v Speaker 2>individualistic and then worrying about </v>
<v Speaker 2>broader concerns of the community and </v>

97
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not altogether a bad thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the college campus,</v>

98
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.293
<v Speaker 2>and it's always been this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a microcosm of what we're </v>

99
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.324
<v Speaker 2>experiencing in the broader society and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's another reason why it's </v>

100
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 2>so important to protect individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights on college campuses because where</v>

101
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:20.734
<v Speaker 2>they fall on college campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are almost certainly short to fall </v>

102
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.740
<v Speaker 2>in society writ large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.613
<v Speaker 2>So that actually we discussed this </v>
<v Speaker 2>briefly right before the cameras turned </v>

104
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my concern about this.</v>

105
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 2>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

106
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:32.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a free speech issue on </v>

107
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:34.684
<v Speaker 2>college campuses and even though I keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to college campuses and it's very </v>

108
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 2>clear to me that there is a free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem there,</v>

109
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's not what's going to happen.</v>

110
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the screaming kids right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

111
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:44.524
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that these are the people that are </v>

112
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 2>going to be in leader positions five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

113
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 2>15 years in the future and further than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that obviously.</v>

114
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.783
<v Speaker 2>And if those ideas take root because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were able to silence us once they </v>

115
00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 2>are the lawmakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they're in charge of public policy,</v>

116
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:03.974
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be too kind to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who they were silencing way back </v>

117
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.404
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

118
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really one of the key </v>

119
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>problems and it's not even just if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get elected to power,</v>

120
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:16.240
<v Speaker 2>even if they aren't elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

121
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 2>and they don't rise to power and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can impose these views on other people.</v>

122
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.283
<v Speaker 2>These are future citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they're not necessarily future </v>

123
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 2>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then discourse of the nation,</v>

124
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.863
<v Speaker 2>if that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prevalent feeling in society is </v>

125
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>going to suffer tremendously as a result</v>
<v Speaker 2>if even if they're not in Congress or in</v>

126
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:38.834
<v Speaker 2>the state legislatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if 50 percent of the country's </v>

127
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 2>population thinks that we shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about certain things,</v>

128
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:45.914
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to talk about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and it's going to be a societal </v>

129
00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 2>he imposed if nothing else.</v>

130
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.403
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's incredibly damaging </v>
<v Speaker 2>to just about every aspect of our life </v>

131
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 2>is as a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting to me because I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

133
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.083
<v Speaker 2>you read about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was at the University of New </v>

134
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Hampshire a couple of weeks ago and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

135
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.613
<v Speaker 2>first we were supposed to give a speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>on campus then about two hours before </v>

136
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 2>they announced that they couldn't secure</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room,</v>

137
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 2>that they felt there were too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>threats.</v>

138
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>So they were about 200 or 250 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be in the room.</v>

139
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:19.481
<v Speaker 2>They moved us to the hockey rink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seats 7,500</v>

140
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I stood in front of,</v>

141
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:22.754
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little,</v>

142
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>backdrop and I talked to about 200 </v>

143
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:26.324
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about 150 people that were there </v>

144
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 2>to listen and be respectful and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

145
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 2>And then they were about probably about </v>
<v Speaker 2>50 protesters roughly.</v>

146
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Those are the rough numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

147
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.533
<v Speaker 2>but the desire just to shout down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use noisemakers to scream to chance </v>

148
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>like robots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love robotic chance.</v>

149
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 2>All of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kept saying to them,</v>

150
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have any direct questions?</v>

151
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.163
<v Speaker 2>Is there something that I've said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you disagree with or is there something </v>

152
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 2>you directly like to ask me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And time and time again,</v>

153
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.033
<v Speaker 2>the answer was no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how you break them out </v>

154
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>of that other than keep having these </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations and hope that the refugees</v>

155
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 2>make it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a common problem.</v>

156
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it really comes down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological purity that people are after</v>

157
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 2>the idea that if I disagree with you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

158
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>whether it's small or even fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I disagree,</v>

159
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:16.604
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with you on that one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means nothing that you have to say </v>

160
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:24.941
<v Speaker 2>could possibly be a value to me and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is completely false.</v>

161
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>That you couldn't be farther from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

162
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 2>We can learn so much from the people we </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with the most.</v>

163
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Even if I disagreed with you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everything.</v>

164
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.903
<v Speaker 2>It would still be incredibly valuable </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to talk to you if only because </v>

165
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.073
<v Speaker 2>that helps me sharpen and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why I believe what I believe </v>

166
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:43.334
<v Speaker 2>in and people really discount the </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance of understanding why you </v>

167
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:47.144
<v Speaker 2>believe something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the argument that I've been making </v>

168
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:49.514
<v Speaker 2>for awhile is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do think right now at least in </v>

169
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 2>2018 and this is more of a problem on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>

170
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.333
<v Speaker 2>that they've owned the ideas and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative and the college campus </v>

171
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 2>discussion and academia and media and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

172
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:01.284
<v Speaker 2>They've owned that for so long that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason these kids end up be are these </v>

173
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 2>students ended up being so hysterical is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they never hear a counter ideas.</v>

174
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.893
<v Speaker 2>So then you get a pretty moderate guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's arguing about liberty and freedom </v>

175
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 2>for everybody and live and let live.</v>

176
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 2>And that actually offends them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they never hear anything outside</v>

177
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>of what they're being taught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goes to the academic part.</v>

178
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I think mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

179
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I think we're doing a really crappy job </v>
<v Speaker 2>of educating students before they get to</v>

180
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 2>college about why free speech and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>other rights are important.</v>

181
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Civics education is clearly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet right now and it's bizarre to me.</v>

182
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Skokie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illinois.</v>

183
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.573
<v Speaker 2>One of the sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most famous free speech </v>

184
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:44.870
<v Speaker 2>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.743
<v Speaker 2>in recent history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you lay it out for those that don't </v>

186
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:49.470
<v Speaker 2>know this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the seventies,</v>

187
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 2>the American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American Socialist Party,</v>

188
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 2>that Nationalist Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Illinois Nazis,</v>

189
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 2>if you'd asked the blues brothers wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to march through Skokie,</v>

190
00:09:58.831 --> 00:09:59.664
<v Speaker 2>Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which outside of New York had the </v>

191
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 2>largest concentration of Holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 2>survivors in the United States.</v>

192
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.943
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and skokie tried to stop them and they </v>

193
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 2>sued with the aid of the American Civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberties Union of Illinois.</v>

194
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.150
<v Speaker 2>And it went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

195
00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:17.280
<v Speaker 2>both the Supreme Court of Illinois and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Supreme Court in the United States.</v>

196
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Nazis had the right to March and</v>

197
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 2>the courts held so and there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>threats of violence.</v>

198
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:27.620
<v Speaker 2>And disruption and all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

199
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.860
<v Speaker 2>people out crying as to how this could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be allowed,</v>

200
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:32.694
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately the Nazis had the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment right to march through skokie </v>

201
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 2>and I grew up learning about that case </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a very young age.</v>

202
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:40.644
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you how many times I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie they made about it and it </v>

203
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.203
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got me thinking at a young age about </v>

204
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 2>why this is important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I think about it,</v>

205
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 2>and I can't tell you that as a young </v>
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>

206
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:53.544
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree that the Nazis should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a right to march when I was that </v>

207
00:10:57.571 --> 00:10:58.404
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I part of me didn't grasp the </v>

208
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 2>overarching fundamental importance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech,</v>

209
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.100
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking about it.</v>

210
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.933
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got there and I get the feeling </v>

211
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:07.104
<v Speaker 2>that sometimes we're not doing enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make our students think about why it's </v>

212
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such an important case and I'm glad</v>

213
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned it because it goes really </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the heart of this,</v>

214
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.710
<v Speaker 2>that the people that lived in Skokie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

215
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the second largest amount of Holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 2>survivors in the country.</v>

216
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 2>These people literally survived a </v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide.</v>

217
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.323
<v Speaker 2>Probably virtually all of them lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them probably lost all of their </v>

218
00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:32.640
<v Speaker 2>family members and friends and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

219
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.073
<v Speaker 2>And yet I would sit here at someone that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost Holocaust survivors on both sides </v>

220
00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:39.030
<v Speaker 2>of my family and tell you it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right decision.</v>

221
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't let the Nazis are the white </v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacists or whatever they are.</v>

222
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.430
<v Speaker 2>You can't let them start ransacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>

223
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 2>You can't let them start killing people </v>
<v Speaker 2>or harming people,</v>

224
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.933
<v Speaker 2>but letting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting them march at the exchange of </v>

225
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:50.894
<v Speaker 2>free speech and it's kind of Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to defend when it's hard to </v>

226
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:54.424
<v Speaker 2>defend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to find it when it's hard </v>

227
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:56.434
<v Speaker 2>to defend because otherwise it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be around to defend when it's </v>

228
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.740
<v Speaker 2>easy to defend.</v>

229
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.953
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start creating exceptions and </v>

230
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 2>encroaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no end to it.</v>

231
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:07.564
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've kind of seen even in other </v>

232
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:10.710
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

233
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.190
<v Speaker 2>that once the encroachments start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>

234
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make that exception and just this one</v>

235
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:18.814
<v Speaker 2>other small exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's inevitably another one </v>

236
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:26.071
<v Speaker 2>and another one and all for perhaps even</v>
<v Speaker 2>no good reasons in terms of,</v>

237
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideals.</v>

238
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 2>And the goals are laudable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps I say it every show,</v>

239
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 2>the road to hell is paved with good </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentions and getting tired and you and</v>

240
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:37.500
<v Speaker 2>me both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

241
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 2>it's really practically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's inevitable.</v>

242
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:41.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of this is just a confusion as </v>

243
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 2>to what the First Amendment is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also what I've started to realize</v>

244
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:49.984
<v Speaker 2>because when I've gone on college </v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses and the protesters are there </v>

245
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>and I always say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I welcome peaceful protest.</v>

246
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I completely welcome.</v>

247
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I welcome the exchange of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is all of that,</v>

248
00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.553
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're screaming about certain </v>

249
00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:01.294
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a disconnect as to </v>

250
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:03.664
<v Speaker 2>what I think to legal things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what the First Amendment is and </v>

251
00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 2>what hate speech is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is or isn't a.</v>

252
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 2>So can you talk about that a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

253
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.123
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to have to hear one more </v>

254
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:16.150
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be student,</v>

255
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.233
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet comment or to even journalists </v>

256
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 2>are faculty members sometimes say hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech is not free speech.</v>

257
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

258
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:24.184
<v Speaker 2>So let's do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do that one first because I </v>

259
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.133
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this will be maybe what we promo </v>

260
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:28.144
<v Speaker 2>for this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really want people to understand </v>

261
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is hate speech free speech?</v>

262
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a legal level,</v>

263
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 2>hate speech is free speech because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>First Amendment and the courts have said</v>

264
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:39.784
<v Speaker 2>nothing about freeze or hate speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>being unprotected by the first </v>

265
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:42.580
<v Speaker 2>amendment.</v>

266
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.413
<v Speaker 2>Speech is protected by the First </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amendment unless it falls under one of </v>

267
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 2>the very few existing categories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unprotected speech.</v>

268
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are.</v>

269
00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:50.954
<v Speaker 2>What are those categories?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's incitement to imminent lawless </v>

270
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 2>action and these all have very high </v>
<v Speaker 2>bars,</v>

271
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>True threats and intimidation.</v>

272
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be sued for libel or slander.</v>

273
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Defamation is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

274
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 2>not some estates I think actually still </v>
<v Speaker 2>have criminal statutes on the book,</v>

275
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.480
<v Speaker 2>but books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're rarely enforced of fraud.</v>

276
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.763
<v Speaker 2>Obscenity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which people often confused with mere </v>

277
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:14.764
<v Speaker 2>profanity or lewdness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are not the same thing by any </v>

278
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 2>stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

279
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference on those two?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

280
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 2>profanity and lewdness or are generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected by the first amendment.</v>

281
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:24.574
<v Speaker 2>Obscenity is a very high bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's speech that has to be our </v>

282
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:30.184
<v Speaker 2>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say more broadly than just </v>

283
00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 2>speech that has to appeal to the puriant</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>

284
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 2>which is an inordinate fascination with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>

285
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.493
<v Speaker 2>describe or depict sex in a patently </v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive way and have no social </v>

286
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.333
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literary or artistic value whatsoever </v>

287
00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:51.480
<v Speaker 2>and to get down in the mud that.</v>

288
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Had you ever heard of crushed videos?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I have,</v>

289
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:57.374
<v Speaker 2>but I'm honestly not sure what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are videos of women wearing </v>

290
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:05.831
<v Speaker 2>stilettos crushing small animals like </v>
<v Speaker 2>hamsters and Gerbils to death and people</v>

291
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 2>apparently get off on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't pretend to understand it.</v>

292
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.063
<v Speaker 2>Even that is not wholly unprotected by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the obscenity exception to the first </v>

293
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 2>amendment that that's particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting case.</v>

294
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:25.950
<v Speaker 2>I suppose because the idea of it talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it seems like A.</v>

295
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.793
<v Speaker 2>I would have no problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the action itself probably there's </v>

296
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 2>some legal reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

297
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Like killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing animals.</v>

298
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.880
<v Speaker 2>There's some law I guess if trolley </v>
<v Speaker 2>state laws,</v>

299
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 2>but if you have this pornography you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>call it that.</v>

300
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a hard time getting it.</v>

301
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.110
<v Speaker 2>If you have it in you to possess it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be prosecuted for,</v>

302
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.510
<v Speaker 2>for possessing that obscene material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting distinction that the</v>

303
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.140
<v Speaker 2>act is the crime or the act is what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal,</v>

304
00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:54.974
<v Speaker 2>not the depiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depiction or disseminating the </v>

305
00:15:57.741 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 2>information or that sort of thing.</v>

306
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A child pornography,</v>

307
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:02.840
<v Speaker 2>obviously not protected by the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>

308
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.730
<v Speaker 2>but there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

309
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 2>there's the one additional wrinkle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fighting words doctrine,</v>

310
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 2>although there's considerable doubt that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it remains a viable,</v>

311
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:14.683
<v Speaker 2>a exception to the first amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really gets brought up a lot in </v>

312
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 2>the hate speech debate to the extent it </v>
<v Speaker 2>still exists.</v>

313
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.213
<v Speaker 2>It's limited to face to face </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions where say I say something </v>

314
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:29.504
<v Speaker 2>to you that is so insanely abusive that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are likely to punch me in the face </v>

315
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:35.654
<v Speaker 2>without thinking twice about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of taking a deep breath and </v>

316
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.900
<v Speaker 2>either ignoring me or coming back at me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's reasons why it's fallen into</v>

317
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:45.314
<v Speaker 2>disuse and it's worthwhile to note that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Supreme Court has upheld a fighting </v>

318
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:49.634
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>convictions since the case in the </v>

319
00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:53.290
<v Speaker 2>forties when it created the fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>words except for.</v>

320
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.060
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting just how far it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen into disuse.</v>

321
00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.290
<v Speaker 2>It incentivizes punching people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

322
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:01.483
<v Speaker 2>It creates an easy way to sensor the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you disagree with and it </v>

323
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:05.954
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume be some level of a subjective </v>

324
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.193
<v Speaker 2>piece of information as to what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is offensive at the highest order </v>

325
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Speaker 2>is different perhaps than what I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what some of these other people.</v>

326
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it it.</v>

327
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.243
<v Speaker 2>It creates terrible incentives and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would basically lead to an </v>

328
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 2>institutionalized heckler's veto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's really not tenable.</v>

329
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on the,</v>

330
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:25.004
<v Speaker 2>on the hate speech front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was clear what the Supreme Court </v>

331
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 2>has said about hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to do it with,</v>

332
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 2>with these exceptions that you've just </v>
<v Speaker 2>laid out,</v>

333
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:33.240
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to see me and things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I.</v>

334
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.220
<v Speaker 2>What I'm realizing on college campuses </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they really don't like that.</v>

335
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Speaker 2>The people that set of people that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

336
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:40.220
<v Speaker 2>they really don't like that.</v>

337
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.053
<v Speaker 2>So like they think if you like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the fact you are allowed to </v>

338
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:46.730
<v Speaker 2>say bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

339
00:17:46.731 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I hate all the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

340
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 2>I hate all the black people and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gays or whatever.</v>

341
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 2>You can say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't cause direct call to violence,</v>

342
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 2>but what I think they think is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep saying those things,</v>

343
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I hate these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's going to incite violence.</v>

344
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Now my counter argument would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

345
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 2>you have to use free speech to counter </v>
<v Speaker 2>those bad ideas.</v>

346
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:09.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole purpose of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you see that,</v>

347
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:10.224
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be the slope that they </v>

348
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 2>consistently are on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if we allow you to say,</v>

349
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate these people,</v>

350
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:17.730
<v Speaker 2>which is bigoted and prejudice and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>

351
00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's afforded to us by the bill of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

352
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 2>They think that that's going to get you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to violence.</v>

353
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 2>How do you combat that notion if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with the premise that is something</v>

354
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:29.780
<v Speaker 2>that we tend to hear a lot in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment world.</v>

355
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

356
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking in this country,</v>

357
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:37.530
<v Speaker 2>we punish the people who do the bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>acts.</v>

358
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.513
<v Speaker 2>If I watch your show and I get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>cookie idea and go off and commit some </v>

359
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.274
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to throw you in jail </v>

360
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:46.644
<v Speaker 2>because I'm an idiot and took a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that you didn't even intend me to </v>

361
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:51.410
<v Speaker 2>take right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be.</v>

362
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.283
<v Speaker 2>It might be different though if I was up</v>
<v Speaker 2>here saying you should violently attack </v>

363
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:55.630
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

364
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

365
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the incitement standard is so</v>

366
00:18:58.591 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

367
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:04.250
<v Speaker 2>To be likely to insight and intended to </v>
<v Speaker 2>incite immediate cRiminal action.</v>

368
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 2>So if I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

369
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be fun to burn down a building,</v>

370
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 2>but you're not likely to do it.</v>

371
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.133
<v Speaker 2>You're going to take it as a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably haven't committed any kind </v>

372
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:16.180
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

373
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm awful expression if I know you're a </v>

374
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:20.740
<v Speaker 2>pyromaniac and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dave,</v>

375
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.330
<v Speaker 2>let's go burn down a building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

376
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I might find mysElf in a very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

377
00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I sort of left that phase at about eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

378
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.000
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

379
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you take a look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my colleagues actually wrote up a</v>

380
00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:35.694
<v Speaker 2>piece for quill at a not so long ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the rwandan genocide and looking </v>

381
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:41.244
<v Speaker 2>over the claims that the radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcasts actually caused more </v>

382
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:46.494
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it turns out is that the radio </v>

383
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:50.184
<v Speaker 2>broadcasts first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only incited people who were already </v>

384
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:01.430
<v Speaker 2>predisposed and whoever you felt that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and it made it marginally easier for</v>

385
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 2>them to find people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be taught how to do certain things,</v>

386
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.273
<v Speaker 2>but it was relatively ineffective as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out in convincing people who </v>

387
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:19.310
<v Speaker 2>weren't already in a murderous rage to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and commit violence.</v>

388
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

389
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:21.144
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the fear that allowing </v>

390
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:27.350
<v Speaker 2>these views to be aired is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>indisputable,</v>

391
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 2>he caused actual violence is somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>overblown.</v>

392
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.113
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a second part to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that people expressing these </v>

393
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:41.331
<v Speaker 2>views might lead to more people adopting</v>
<v Speaker 2>those views and having prejudice view.</v>

394
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

395
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.910
<v Speaker 2>RighT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the part I was referenced,</v>

396
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.753
<v Speaker 2>but that's kinda the point is that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>put those out there so we can fight </v>

397
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:53.104
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we don't have them in public and we </v>

398
00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 2>can't fight them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still going to spread nothing.</v>

399
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 2>No idea ever went away because we said </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that.</v>

400
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does the heckler's veto fit into all</v>

401
00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:09.364
<v Speaker 2>of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things that I again </v>

402
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:11.883
<v Speaker 2>see on college campuses is when hecklers</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts screaming at you and then you </v>

403
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a second,</v>

404
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to your question or calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever you might say.</v>

405
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>

406
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:23.254
<v Speaker 2>well I have a right to free speech too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to flip it on you to make you </v>

407
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 2>look like a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually kinda kinda gets me,</v>

408
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:32.770
<v Speaker 2>but I will give them a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

409
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.693
<v Speaker 2>I think You say a university event and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody comes in and they chant for 30 </v>

410
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:44.581
<v Speaker 2>seconds or they stand up and turn their </v>
<v Speaker 2>backs and that's the extent of it.</v>

411
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I Think that we should protect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically.</v>

412
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Are they causing a disruption?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

413
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.233
<v Speaker 2>but it's minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually maximized the amount </v>

414
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:59.020
<v Speaker 2>of free speech just to be some room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>very minimal disruption,</v>

415
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.183
<v Speaker 2>but when it gets to the point where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are substantially interfering with the </v>

416
00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:04.720
<v Speaker 2>speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ability to get their message across</v>

417
00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:05.554
<v Speaker 2>or the audience's ability to hear them </v>
<v Speaker 2>through repeated shouting or noise </v>

418
00:22:09.171 --> 00:22:13.120
<v Speaker 2>makers or standing in the front and </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocking everyone's views,</v>

419
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>

420
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.203
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And last year we just saw a rash of a </v>

421
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.863
<v Speaker 2>heckler's vetoes going on and it kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all started with berkeley and milo </v>

422
00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:26.614
<v Speaker 2>yiannopoulos when they protesters were </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful in shutting down the event </v>

423
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:32.104
<v Speaker 2>through what had been before that been </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfathomable on a college campus for an </v>

424
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:37.624
<v Speaker 2>invited speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen invited speaker controversy </v>

425
00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:40.684
<v Speaker 2>since fire was founded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically never ever am I aware of any </v>

426
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 2>incident that came close to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

427
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.370
<v Speaker 2>It was just madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

428
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.210
<v Speaker 2>And they got away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The so few arrests were made.</v>

429
00:22:55.211 --> 00:23:00.211
<v Speaker 2>And I can't help but wonder if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>students out at middlebury college where</v>

430
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.773
<v Speaker 2>Charles Murray was speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees done that and looked at the </v>

431
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:06.190
<v Speaker 2>berkeley students and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

432
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.413
<v Speaker 2>they were successful in stopping that </v>
<v Speaker 2>event with speech that we also did </v>

433
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 2>tested and they got away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's try that.</v>

434
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a viable tactic.</v>

435
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.940
<v Speaker 2>This might be a solution for keepIng </v>
<v Speaker 2>this speech.</v>

436
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:22.870
<v Speaker 2>We disagree with off campus and ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

437
00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:27.871
<v Speaker 2>that the tactics that students are able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to successfully utilized,</v>

438
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.720
<v Speaker 2>they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behavior that is rewarded essentially is</v>

439
00:23:31.721 --> 00:23:33.070
<v Speaker 2>going to be repeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.080
<v Speaker 2>And I see that all over the place right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

441
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:35.914
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a couple of months after milo went </v>

442
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.020
<v Speaker 2>to berkeley and that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ben shapiro spoke,</v>

443
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:46.021
<v Speaker 2>they already was largely nonviolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it cost the $600,000</v>

444
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.760
<v Speaker 2>to make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

445
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:52.580
<v Speaker 2>I think an atm was broken in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>windows and that's it.</v>

446
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.270
<v Speaker 2>But that's part of the tactic is if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can keep ramping this up,</v>

447
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.940
<v Speaker 2>we'll keep pushing the security costs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as I said,</v>

448
00:23:58.941 --> 00:23:59.774
<v Speaker 2>they had to move my event to a freaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hockey theater that a hockey arena that </v>

449
00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have been cheap and and several</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

450
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.693
<v Speaker 2>These I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're familiar with the case </v>

451
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:07.634
<v Speaker 2>of lindsay shepherd up at wilfrid </v>
<v Speaker 2>laurier from Canada and she just had to </v>

452
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 2>crowdfund I think around six grand to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get security for one of her events.</v>

453
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 2>So that almost seems like the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactic.</v>

454
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:17.864
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can scare them with some threats of </v>

455
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:21.524
<v Speaker 2>violence and some other stuff and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>will cause the security costs to be so </v>

456
00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 2>high that you guys will just give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

457
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:27.794
<v Speaker 2>and that's another problem we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting since even before all of this </v>

458
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:30.674
<v Speaker 2>came to a head is colleges and </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities trying to charge student </v>

459
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:34.814
<v Speaker 2>groups security fees for the speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the anticipated protest or </v>

460
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:42.710
<v Speaker 2>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's plainly unconstitutional.</v>

461
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:43.544
<v Speaker 2>It has been for a long time since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme court said that a listener's </v>

462
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:51.730
<v Speaker 2>reaction is not a content neutral basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>for regulation.</v>

463
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.770
<v Speaker 2>You cannot charge more for controversial</v>
<v Speaker 2>speakers because they might drop protest</v>

464
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.940
<v Speaker 2>that places have a price tag on </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression and prices,</v>

465
00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.013
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will price the controversial </v>

466
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.294
<v Speaker 2>expression out of the marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to be able to afford </v>

467
00:25:07.221 --> 00:25:07.310
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

468
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 2>What student group has $17,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to spend on security,</v>

469
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.163
<v Speaker 2>none of them and you know what it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to is administrators at the </v>

470
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:17.474
<v Speaker 2>university itself has to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantor of last resort when it comes </v>

471
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:21.044
<v Speaker 2>to speakers ability to speak and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the business they are in and sometimes </v>

472
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.000
<v Speaker 2>it's unpleasant and sometimes it costs a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole lot of money,</v>

473
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.343
<v Speaker 2>but if you're not going to have a campus</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we can discuss things and we can </v>

474
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:38.654
<v Speaker 2>debate things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it gets loud and boisterous and </v>

475
00:25:40.401 --> 00:25:41.234
<v Speaker 2>raucous and contentious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is everything free speech should </v>

476
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:46.670
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your campus isn't going to be a place</v>

477
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:49.910
<v Speaker 2>where that occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what are you?</v>

478
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.403
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do want to make a point of saying </v>

479
00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:56.024
<v Speaker 2>that some of the campuses are getting it</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and I'm sure you know some of the </v>

480
00:25:58.161 --> 00:26:00.620
<v Speaker 2>campuses that are doing a little better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than some of the others.</v>

481
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.350
<v Speaker 2>But for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

482
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.910
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017,</v>

483
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:05.744
<v Speaker 2>I spoke at claremont mckenna at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a big free speech push </v>

484
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:09.914
<v Speaker 2>because of what happened the semester </v>
<v Speaker 2>before with Heather Mcdonald and all </v>

485
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:17.090
<v Speaker 2>hell broke loose and on the campus and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was completely welcomed there and they,</v>

486
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 2>even some of the students who disagreed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>

487
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean they asked me questions and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that good stuff.</v>

488
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:22.904
<v Speaker 2>So it's where I alwaYs think it's worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioning that some schools are doing </v>

489
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:27.970
<v Speaker 2>their best to manage some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

490
00:26:27.971 --> 00:26:29.090
<v Speaker 2>And on two levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

491
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:29.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

492
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:31.700
<v Speaker 2>fire rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>policies at schools,</v>

493
00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 2>we raised over 400 different colleges </v>
<v Speaker 2>and universities on a red light,</v>

494
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 2>yellow light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>green light level,</v>

495
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:37.863
<v Speaker 2>a red light being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have policies that are clearly in </v>

496
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>substantially unconstitutional yellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>light being.</v>

497
00:26:43.921 --> 00:26:44.754
<v Speaker 2>You have policies that are susceptible </v>
<v Speaker 2>to being applied in bad ways and </v>

498
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:48.774
<v Speaker 2>greenlight schools where none of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies poses a serious threat to free </v>

499
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>speech in the past couple of years.</v>

500
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 2>The number of green light schools that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have has nearly doubled,</v>

501
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 2>which is tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

502
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 2>still close to 60 percent of schools </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a yellow light,</v>

503
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:08.811
<v Speaker 2>so there's work to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you combine that with the 38 schools</v>

504
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:09.834
<v Speaker 2>that have now put out statements </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressly committing themselves to free </v>

505
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:14.190
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

506
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.210
<v Speaker 2>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

507
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 2>the university of chicago kicked off a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while back.</v>

508
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.953
<v Speaker 2>There's reasons to be hopeful and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>work regularly with administrators who </v>

509
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 2>are happy to have a consult on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies and say,</v>

510
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are the changes we would make a.</v>

511
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:29.690
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're,</v>

512
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 2>we have amicable relationships with so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many administrators,</v>

513
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 2>which is really gratifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the student side also,</v>

514
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:38.963
<v Speaker 2>part of it is overblown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think by media there are a lot of </v>

515
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:42.684
<v Speaker 2>students out there who do get it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have all ideologies and all </v>

516
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:49.130
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

517
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.483
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of students out there </v>

518
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:56.070
<v Speaker 2>who get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I speak to them on a daily basis and I,</v>

519
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.280
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot of reason to have hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a lost cause.</v>

520
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.221
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

521
00:28:02.221 --> 00:28:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even again at that university of</v>

522
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:06.324
<v Speaker 1>New Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think 75 percent of the crowd at least </v>

523
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 1>was there respectfully decently to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and,</v>

524
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:14.310
<v Speaker 1>and do that what I felt was important </v>
<v Speaker 1>after and why I still want to talk about</v>

525
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:15.144
<v Speaker 1>and have you here and all that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want people to be armed with </v>

526
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the right arguments so that when these </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of people,</v>

527
00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 1>even if it's just a smaller set that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just really loud.</v>

528
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:25.350
<v Speaker 1>So as a disproportionate amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

529
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 1>I want people to understand there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactics you can use to fight it.</v>

530
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:30.504
<v Speaker 1>So I'm curious on that list of 38 </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools that's kind of doing it right </v>

531
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.460
<v Speaker 1>right now when they've instituted some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these policies.</v>

532
00:28:35.461 --> 00:28:38.010
<v Speaker 1>And I remember when university of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicago did it about a year ago,</v>

533
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.203
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there evidence that things actually </v>

534
00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:44.550
<v Speaker 1>get better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm going to guess that when you</v>

535
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:47.130
<v Speaker 1>give some rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these students,</v>

536
00:28:47.131 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be kicked out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and they might actually</v>

537
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.200
<v Speaker 2>behave better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

538
00:28:52.201 --> 00:28:53.034
<v Speaker 2>so I think you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of conversation right now </v>

539
00:28:56.191 --> 00:29:00.900
<v Speaker 2>about some legislation even that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on about a disrupting speeches,</v>

540
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.800
<v Speaker 2>mandatory punishments for students who </v>
<v Speaker 2>do sell a certain number of times.</v>

541
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:05.643
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's actually less </v>
<v Speaker 2>important than I actually have somewhat </v>

542
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:10.554
<v Speaker 2>of a problem with the laws that create </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandatory punishments for vaguely </v>

543
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 2>defined terms like disrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

544
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be applied to pretty much anything</v>

545
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:21.750
<v Speaker 2>that a sneeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

546
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.093
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think more important is when </v>

547
00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 2>administration is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

548
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:30.953
<v Speaker 2>these are the values that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is the wellspring of </v>

549
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.470
<v Speaker 2>intellectual vitality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our institution relies on a,</v>

550
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.623
<v Speaker 2>these are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideals you should be paying </v>

551
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:41.643
<v Speaker 2>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's going to make your </v>

552
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:43.594
<v Speaker 2>experience really worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think students will will listen to </v>

553
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:47.614
<v Speaker 2>that instead of maintaining the policies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that say thou shalt not say mean things </v>

554
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:51.724
<v Speaker 2>about your classmates that get students </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very different mindset when they </v>

555
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:56.884
<v Speaker 2>come to college.</v>

556
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.120
<v Speaker 2>What are the statements are or what are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the principles that you add?</v>

557
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.900
<v Speaker 2>You guys want to see in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>statements.</v>

558
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.980
<v Speaker 2>The principles are largely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a place of debate.</v>

559
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 2>This is a place of intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration.</v>

560
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:13.770
<v Speaker 2>It is not our job as administrators or </v>
<v Speaker 2>as faculty members to silence ideas that</v>

561
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:17.920
<v Speaker 2>we find controversial or protect you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from them.</v>

562
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:23.370
<v Speaker 2>It is our job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is our mission to expose you to ideas</v>

563
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:26.344
<v Speaker 2>that you might disagree with and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>you the tools that you need to analyze </v>

564
00:30:29.681 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think critically about them,</v>

565
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:32.404
<v Speaker 2>formulate your own ideas and participate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the conversation because that's what </v>

566
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:36.364
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to do when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave after four or however many years </v>

567
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of life and our democracy is</v>

568
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:45.370
<v Speaker 2>participation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't participate,</v>

569
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.340
<v Speaker 2>then you know as the saying goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't participate,</v>

570
00:30:48.341 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 2>you have no grounds to complain.</v>

571
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.813
<v Speaker 2>We have to really get students in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset that these are important life </v>

572
00:30:56.891 --> 00:31:01.150
<v Speaker 2>skills and they're important to even in </v>
<v Speaker 2>other instances in the workplace.</v>

573
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:05.320
<v Speaker 2>That can be important if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy position,</v>

574
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:08.890
<v Speaker 2>If you're working at a company that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is either bad or one that you want</v>

575
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:09.724
<v Speaker 2>to promote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to think about the </v>

576
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:15.610
<v Speaker 2>people who disagree with you and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to say,</v>

577
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:19.660
<v Speaker 2>anticipate their response and formulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>an argument that resolves it.</v>

578
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.763
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's countless situations in the </v>

579
00:31:22.331 --> 00:31:23.164
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of college were being able to </v>

580
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:29.050
<v Speaker 2>think critically is incredibly important</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really,</v>

581
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.183
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you get a lot of value out </v>

582
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:33.424
<v Speaker 2>of doing that outside of the classroom </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it teaches you how to </v>

583
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.160
<v Speaker 2>contextualize the skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the teaches you how to apply it,</v>

584
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Speaker 2>not just in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this assignment,</v>

585
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about it kind of way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's really not how life works</v>

586
00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:46.714
<v Speaker 2>once you graduate.</v>

587
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.943
<v Speaker 2>I wish it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would make things a whole lot </v>

588
00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:51.260
<v Speaker 2>simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'd be out of a job probably.</v>

589
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.293
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to find something else to </v>

590
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

591
00:31:54.491 --> 00:31:57.070
<v Speaker 2>so we touched on the first amendment a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit in the first half,</v>

592
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.203
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's also just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental misunderstanding about what </v>

593
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:04.750
<v Speaker 2>speech is related to the first amendment</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that the first amendment basically is</v>

594
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:05.584
<v Speaker 2>about what the government is not allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and people have now extrapolated </v>

595
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:11.890
<v Speaker 2>that to think it means what everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do.</v>

596
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.813
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that famous xkcd comic about a </v>

597
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.043
<v Speaker 2>people have the right to tell you you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>an asshole on the internet and it </v>

598
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.440
<v Speaker 2>doesn't violate the first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's true.</v>

599
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Although I see it all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

600
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.013
<v Speaker 2>I get that comic thrown at me sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>even when it's a government institution </v>

601
00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:29.560
<v Speaker 2>doIng the censorship.</v>

602
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.393
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's overused a little bit too and that </v>

603
00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.940
<v Speaker 2>kinda just gets in my craw a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but tHe first amendment really only Does</v>

604
00:32:37.241 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 2>protect you from the government and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't just protect you from congress.</v>

605
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:41.684
<v Speaker 2>It protects you from the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It protects you from the municipalities </v>

606
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:45.224
<v Speaker 2>that protects you from the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges and universities and their </v>

607
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:48.300
<v Speaker 2>administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

608
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.050
<v Speaker 2>those are all state actors for the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>

609
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't protect you against is </v>
<v Speaker 2>your private employer,</v>

610
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 2>which means that I could well be fired </v>
<v Speaker 2>for anything I say on this show today.</v>

611
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.490
<v Speaker 2>See what I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to give you an ideas.</v>

612
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 2>your parents don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say I remember saying free speech</v>

614
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:11.720
<v Speaker 2>to my parents and I was very young </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably right after I read it about the</v>

615
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:14.570
<v Speaker 2>skokie case and my mother giving me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

616
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.290
<v Speaker 2>either burn a hole through my skull at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point,</v>

617
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.293
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it only protects you against the </v>

618
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:22.610
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

619
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.443
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't protect you from criticism of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your peers and your contemporaries and </v>

620
00:33:26.301 --> 00:33:27.170
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:31.970
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of part and parcel of having</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public conversation is if you have a</v>

622
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.130
<v Speaker 2>bad idea and you're out there spouting </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

623
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 2>we all have the right to tell you you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a shitty idea and we should say that</v>

624
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:39.703
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we might see that shitty idea is </v>

625
00:33:42.971 --> 00:33:43.550
<v Speaker 2>spreading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

626
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.210
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of the point of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking aboUt earlier about</v>

627
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.073
<v Speaker 2>letting these terrible ideas out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so that we can stand up and defeat </v>

628
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:52.094
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

629
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:52.993
<v Speaker 2>Are you seeing any major threats right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now from the government related to free </v>

630
00:33:57.381 --> 00:33:58.214
<v Speaker 2>speech?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of times I'll see people </v>

631
00:33:59.360 --> 00:33:59.751
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

632
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:02.870
<v Speaker 2>trump Is attacking this or he texts </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism a lot now.</v>

633
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 2>it's no secret what my feeling about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media is these days.</v>

634
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.823
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's largely just partisan </v>

635
00:34:08.751 --> 00:34:09.584
<v Speaker 2>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should be killing </v>

636
00:34:11.241 --> 00:34:13.190
<v Speaker 2>these people are harming these people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>any way.</v>

637
00:34:13.191 --> 00:34:14.024
<v Speaker 2>Just to be very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that by by mocking them and </v>

638
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:18.404
<v Speaker 2>exposing their nonsense will get a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation of better journalists and </v>

639
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 2>people who really live to the code of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find truth and all of that.</v>

640
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.520
<v Speaker 2>But do you see a direct threat right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from the government,</v>

641
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.940
<v Speaker 2>either from trump or or elsewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always indirect threat yet.</v>

642
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be clear.</v>

643
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:38.330
<v Speaker 2>People in power will always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if given the opportunity,</v>

644
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.463
<v Speaker 2>silence their opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will preserve the status quo and </v>

645
00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:46.601
<v Speaker 2>it's not just people in power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't entirely human reaction to want</v>

646
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.980
<v Speaker 2>to censor the people we disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think we have terrible ideas.</v>

647
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.640
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a baser instincts that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>all have now.</v>

648
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.290
<v Speaker 2>We have to overcome that and understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the value of,</v>

649
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.270
<v Speaker 2>of not doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

650
00:35:00.271 --> 00:35:01.104
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of understandable in a way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why we have to be so vigilant in </v>

651
00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:08.240
<v Speaker 2>protecting free speech because once the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools are there,</v>

652
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.343
<v Speaker 2>they don't go away and we've seen this </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history and their wield it </v>

653
00:35:12.771 --> 00:35:13.604
<v Speaker 2>and people laughed at me when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking during the election cycle to I </v>

654
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:20.930
<v Speaker 2>guess kind of betrayed some of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal political.</v>

655
00:35:20.931 --> 00:35:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Leif said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

656
00:35:22.011 --> 00:35:22.844
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of talking about how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>executive branch overreach as many </v>

657
00:35:26.721 --> 00:35:30.530
<v Speaker 2>people did have the last administration </v>
<v Speaker 2>was problematic because you know,</v>

658
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.353
<v Speaker 2>what about the next guy comes to power?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's going to do something crazy </v>

659
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 2>and nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all laughed at me.</v>

660
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about that.</v>

661
00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:41.310
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about it when bush was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>

662
00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:42.144
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about it when obama was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it and they laughed and then </v>

663
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.580
<v Speaker 2>donald j dot trump was elected president</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I looked at them and I said,</v>

664
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.573
<v Speaker 2>what now?</v>

665
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

666
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

667
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't be possible that somebody we</v>

668
00:35:57.811 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 2>disagree with all that much who we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really terrible,</v>

669
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get elected president.</v>

670
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 2>And when they started melting down over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the election,</v>

671
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.663
<v Speaker 2>I looked at them and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told you so you can't be for if </v>

672
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 2>executive actions when it's the guy you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

673
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:16.320
<v Speaker 2>but then not for them when it's the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like,</v>

674
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 2>of course they're all going to do it if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you give them the power to do it.</v>

675
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing with free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

676
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.630
<v Speaker 2>and I think what's really important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember is that those mechanisms,</v>

677
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:28.254
<v Speaker 2>those tools with censorship are never </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever going to redound to the benefit of </v>

678
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 2>the marginalized communities that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are oftentimes seeking to protect.</v>

679
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.560
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason they are marginalized is that</v>

680
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 2>they don't have political power.</v>

681
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.523
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to be the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>implementing these rules and that's </v>

682
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:50.423
<v Speaker 2>incredibly problematic and people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that very practical reality </v>

683
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.583
<v Speaker 2>that those tools and censorship are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be used to defend the status </v>

684
00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 2>quo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what these people are trying to</v>

685
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:01.224
<v Speaker 2>disrupt and disruption is kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the major threat that everyone in </v>

686
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:07.374
<v Speaker 2>power feels and it we've seen it </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history that they're in the </v>

687
00:37:11.731 --> 00:37:12.564
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement when protestors </v>
<v Speaker 2>were arrested for sitting at lunch </v>

688
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 2>counters or for engaging in nonviolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>protests,</v>

689
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:23.130
<v Speaker 2>but were arrested for disorderly conduct</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people reacted to their protests</v>

690
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:25.440
<v Speaker 2>and violent ways because there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent vicodin,</v>

691
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:30.470
<v Speaker 2>thugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were only exonerated Because of the</v>

692
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:32.604
<v Speaker 2>first amendment and it took going to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme court and it's really important </v>

693
00:37:35.971 --> 00:37:36.804
<v Speaker 2>to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

694
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.123
<v Speaker 2>how many lgbt artists and authors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications faced censorship and had </v>

695
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:43.944
<v Speaker 2>their materials deemed obscenity at </v>
<v Speaker 2>times and not even sent through the </v>

696
00:37:47.971 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 2>mail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:49.794
<v Speaker 2>sometImes before and preventing them </v>
<v Speaker 2>from integrating into the national </v>

698
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:56.100
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

699
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:56.933
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

700
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.910
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really important to.</v>

701
00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is there something happening right </v>

702
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:05.520
<v Speaker 2>now via the government that you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be happening?</v>

703
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.870
<v Speaker 2>I get the broad sense sort of blue sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of this that yes,</v>

704
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:10.704
<v Speaker 2>people in power always are gonna want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain power and do what they have to </v>

705
00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 2>do to silence people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

706
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.250
<v Speaker 2>But at the college and university level </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>

707
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:22.251
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it is coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>department of justice and the office for</v>

708
00:38:24.091 --> 00:38:26.520
<v Speaker 2>civil rights of the department of </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

709
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:27.383
<v Speaker 2>A few years back I had an agreement that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they called a blueprint for sexual </v>

710
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:32.814
<v Speaker 2>harassment policies at colleges and </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities and it basically defines </v>

711
00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:39.520
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment is any unwelcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct of a sexual nature,</v>

712
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.383
<v Speaker 2>including verbal conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we also know as speech and the </v>

713
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:52.470
<v Speaker 2>breathtaking broadness of that policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>really kind of spread like wildfire.</v>

714
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:55.623
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these harassment policies have always </v>

715
00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.300
<v Speaker 2>been problematic at times.</v>

716
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 2>This is directly tied to title nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

717
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know it's,</v>

718
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.203
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's even an unintended </v>

719
00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:07.624
<v Speaker 2>consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a very well unintended </v>

720
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:12.220
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you start seeing things.</v>

721
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

722
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.850
<v Speaker 2>just the number of years back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a student at the university of</v>

723
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.713
<v Speaker 2>Oregon who was sitting on the ledge in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dorm room window and she saw a couple </v>

724
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 2>outside and as a joke she shouted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit it first,</v>

725
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.543
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't even know what that meant</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it first came into my head to look </v>

726
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:33.060
<v Speaker 2>it up and I realized that it was about </v>
<v Speaker 2>ray j,</v>

727
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having sex with kim kardashians and </v>

728
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.053
<v Speaker 2>kanye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the thing people care </v>

729
00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:39.200
<v Speaker 2>about nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

730
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:40.250
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

731
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>he is the leader of speech movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

732
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe I do need to find another job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>

733
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:52.950
<v Speaker 2>that the couple was offended and ran </v>
<v Speaker 2>upstairs and talk to the ra.</v>

734
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.793
<v Speaker 2>And this student was hit with several </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplinary charges including sexual </v>

735
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:00.970
<v Speaker 2>harassment for just shouting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit it first.</v>

736
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.420
<v Speaker 2>And this is because of the latitude that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these laws gave colleges to.</v>

737
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

738
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>department of education said,</v>

739
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:11.650
<v Speaker 2>this is what we consider sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>harassment.</v>

740
00:40:11.651 --> 00:40:12.484
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no college in university administrator </v>

741
00:40:13.891 --> 00:40:15.460
<v Speaker 2>in the right mind is going to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and say,</v>

742
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:16.600
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just ignore that.</v>

743
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:17.583
<v Speaker 2>They're going to write new policies </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want huge </v>

744
00:40:18.881 --> 00:40:20.860
<v Speaker 2>investigations that costs a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

745
00:40:20.861 --> 00:40:21.694
<v Speaker 2>take a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have ultimately the potential to </v>

746
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 2>cost the school all of its federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding when it comes down to it.</v>

747
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.630
<v Speaker 2>So we've seen the proliferation of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>really broad policies,</v>

748
00:40:31.631 --> 00:40:35.260
<v Speaker 2>some of which have hilarious lists of </v>
<v Speaker 2>examples of things that could constitute</v>

749
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:39.280
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like inappropriately directed laughter,</v>

750
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.120
<v Speaker 2>elevator eyes is another fire fame for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

751
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:43.323
<v Speaker 2>These are all things that are known as </v>
<v Speaker 2>flirting recording or whatever you call </v>

752
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.050
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>term,</v>

753
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.210
<v Speaker 2>but like that's how you meet people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it,</v>

754
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

755
00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:53.224
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and honestly it's the sexual harassment </v>

756
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:57.274
<v Speaker 2>angle has become a broader </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminatory harassment angle because </v>

757
00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:04.180
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these policies start to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same based on any protected class.</v>

758
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And so when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

759
00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:12.270
<v Speaker 2>any unwelcome comments based on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected class,</v>

760
00:41:12.271 --> 00:41:12.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

761
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.800
<v Speaker 2>the not drawing from a particular policy</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything is harassed.</v>

762
00:41:16.801 --> 00:41:17.634
<v Speaker 2>Discriminatory harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a big problem because that </v>

763
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.490
<v Speaker 2>cuts off subjectively whichever way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

764
00:41:24.491 --> 00:41:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Basically half of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a debate.</v>

765
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.640
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

766
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:28.474
<v Speaker 2>on different sides of affirmative action</v>
<v Speaker 2>are both going to find their opponents </v>

767
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 2>ideology probably offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

768
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.750
<v Speaker 2>if you are against affirmative action </v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

769
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 2>you might be a people who support </v>
<v Speaker 2>affirmative action,</v>

770
00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:46.874
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

771
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.833
<v Speaker 2>that is discriminatory based on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected class race and they shouldn't </v>

772
00:41:52.491 --> 00:41:53.324
<v Speaker 2>be allowed to say that.</v>

773
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.830
<v Speaker 2>We've seen students hosting events like </v>
<v Speaker 2>affirmative action bake sales to kind of</v>

774
00:41:57.831 --> 00:41:58.664
<v Speaker 2>make a point about what they think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unfairness and affirmative action </v>

775
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.393
<v Speaker 2>and administrators have tried to shut </v>
<v Speaker 2>them down and sometimes succeeded and </v>

776
00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:09.584
<v Speaker 2>shutting them down and I can give you </v>
<v Speaker 2>countless examples of things just like </v>

777
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

778
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.983
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous because it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>creates an orthodoxy of what we're </v>

779
00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:20.774
<v Speaker 2>allowed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're allowed to think and you </v>

780
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:26.840
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no position in that.</v>

781
00:42:26.841 --> 00:42:27.674
<v Speaker 2>I can think of that I'm and I can say </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I think there is no position </v>

782
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.323
<v Speaker 2>that shouldn't be subject to challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing that shouldn't be </v>

783
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:36.434
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to somebody disagreeing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in a public way and starting that </v>

784
00:42:41.181 --> 00:42:42.014
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has the right to declare this is </v>

785
00:42:46.131 --> 00:42:47.930
<v Speaker 2>how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

786
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I guess our collective to circle back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning.</v>

787
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:58.490
<v Speaker 2>It's our collective right to participate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that decision of what we believe.</v>

788
00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I have</v>

789
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.313
<v Speaker 1>problem with this related to the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the modern left fuels with these </v>

790
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.010
<v Speaker 1>things because if you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

791
00:43:08.011 --> 00:43:10.260
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to draw cartoons about </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>

792
00:43:10.261 --> 00:43:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying you should go out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your way to offend people,</v>

793
00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.080
<v Speaker 1>but once you say we're going to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things not to be done,</v>

794
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.800
<v Speaker 1>you've handed all of your faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your power,</v>

795
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.730
<v Speaker 1>all of your decision making capability </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to a certain set of people.</v>

796
00:43:23.731 --> 00:43:26.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what those people believe in or are.</v>

797
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.960
<v Speaker 1>But then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then they know,</v>

798
00:43:27.961 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got them with something.</v>

799
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.070
<v Speaker 1>We can just keep going and going and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going and before you know it,</v>

800
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.520
<v Speaker 1>you know it's too late to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight back.</v>

801
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again it's going to backfire.</v>

802
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:39.970
<v Speaker 2>It's going to backfire against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and,</v>

803
00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:40.804
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you see it backfiring </v>

804
00:43:43.101 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at the faculty members recently</v>

805
00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:47.894
<v Speaker 2>who have been targeted by outrage mobs </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people calling for their heads or </v>

806
00:43:50.751 --> 00:43:54.560
<v Speaker 2>their jobs or sometimes both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when by the way,</v>

807
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.453
<v Speaker 2>and my good friend bret weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still does not have a job just </v>

808
00:43:58.701 --> 00:43:59.534
<v Speaker 2>recently for more straightening example </v>
<v Speaker 2>even is a fresno state random gerard </v>

809
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:09.460
<v Speaker 2>treated some intemperate and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly polite things about Barbara</v>

810
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Bush right after she died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

811
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.110
<v Speaker 2>and you're being very kind and she can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever she wants.</v>

812
00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:17.600
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty nasty stuff.</v>

813
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.050
<v Speaker 2>My mother told me never to speak ill of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dead sea.</v>

814
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

815
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were being nice to,</v>

816
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.253
<v Speaker 2>to what was tweeted feelings here and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the right that was calling for her </v>

817
00:44:30.411 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 2>head and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my colleagues,</v>

818
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:33.770
<v Speaker 2>I felt really bad.</v>

819
00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.900
<v Speaker 2>I was the one who helped write the </v>
<v Speaker 2>letter,</v>

820
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:40.650
<v Speaker 2>but he was the one who wrote our public </v>
<v Speaker 2>facing blog post done on the website.</v>

821
00:44:40.651 --> 00:44:41.484
<v Speaker 2>He was getting hate mail and probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>still is getting hate mail from people </v>

822
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you defend this woman?</v>

823
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 2>How could you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

824
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 2>it goes both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's going to sense try and censor</v>

825
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:54.330
<v Speaker 2>their opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just really be careful.</v>

826
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:55.081
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

827
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you brought that one up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically this,</v>

828
00:44:56.971 --> 00:44:58.420
<v Speaker 2>this woman who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a professor,</v>

829
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.640
<v Speaker 2>she tweeted some really nasty stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Barbara Bush who had just died and</v>

830
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by every account,</v>

831
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Barbara Bush was a totally decent woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's actually irrelevant for this.</v>

832
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.270
<v Speaker 2>And yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the right started screaming and oh,</v>

833
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:10.680
<v Speaker 2>she should be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She should be fired.</v>

834
00:45:10.681 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 2>She was not fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fresno state.</v>

835
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.770
<v Speaker 2>She's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

836
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:16.320
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

837
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 2>this is an exact example of how free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech is supposed to work.</v>

838
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 2>She said what she wanted people mocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>her or supported her.</v>

839
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.400
<v Speaker 2>The university decided to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>

840
00:45:26.401 --> 00:45:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Now it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the university had fired her,</v>

841
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.500
<v Speaker 2>let's say they had said these ideas are </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the pale.</v>

842
00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:32.334
<v Speaker 2>And then people started digging into </v>
<v Speaker 2>some other things that she's said that </v>

843
00:45:34.351 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are pretty radical.</v>

844
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that had happened where you guys have</v>

845
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:39.594
<v Speaker 2>offered her defense because doesn't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university have the right to make the </v>

846
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:42.924
<v Speaker 2>decisions that it wants?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what their policies are on </v>

847
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 2>tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

848
00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:46.464
<v Speaker 2>or that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't they have the right to employ </v>

849
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:49.980
<v Speaker 2>people that they want to be employed or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not?</v>

850
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.233
<v Speaker 2>Not that I want to give that power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mob because we know that the mob </v>

851
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.983
<v Speaker 2>does awful things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends when the government as an </v>

852
00:45:57.181 --> 00:46:01.110
<v Speaker 2>employer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government actually is restricted in</v>

853
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:02.070
<v Speaker 2>what it can do.</v>

854
00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 2>A for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an with respect respect to an employee's</v>

855
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.673
<v Speaker 2>off duty speech when a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's particularly </v>

856
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:14.790
<v Speaker 2>important with faculty members who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be public intellectuals.</v>

857
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:15.624
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to be out there kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing and debating this is what we </v>

858
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:22.260
<v Speaker 2>expect out of faculty members at </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges and universities,</v>

859
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.423
<v Speaker 2>but when the government is the employer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the speeches made as a private </v>

860
00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:27.624
<v Speaker 2>citizen on a matter of public concern is</v>
<v Speaker 2>this very clearly was then the </v>

861
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:32.394
<v Speaker 2>government has to make a pretty high </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that that speech so materially </v>

862
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.840
<v Speaker 2>interferes with the provision of </v>
<v Speaker 2>services that the government is involved</v>

863
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:45.090
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it warrants overcoming the employer</v>

864
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.340
<v Speaker 2>employees first amendment rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

865
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.233
<v Speaker 2>and we actually wrote a long letter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose co-sign sign by the aclu of </v>

866
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:53.490
<v Speaker 2>northern California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

867
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.430
<v Speaker 2>electronic frontier foundation and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of other,</v>

868
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.323
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations and on [inaudible] behalf </v>

869
00:47:00.271 --> 00:47:00.870
<v Speaker 2>and sent it.</v>

870
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:04.070
<v Speaker 2>And incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shortly after they got our letter,</v>

871
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:04.943
<v Speaker 2>the university issued their statement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they weren't going to discipline </v>

872
00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:08.590
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

873
00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:09.423
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you are making the distinction in </v>

874
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 2>this case that because this was not on </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus,</v>

875
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:17.690
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't being in a class taught in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the class or,</v>

876
00:47:17.691 --> 00:47:19.430
<v Speaker 2>or brainwashing students in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classroom,</v>

877
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.590
<v Speaker 2>that's different what she's doing on her</v>
<v Speaker 2>private side.</v>

878
00:47:22.591 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 2>And especially because as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a public intellectual,</v>

879
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that that's different than perhaps</v>

880
00:47:28.861 --> 00:47:31.840
<v Speaker 2>if she had said these very same things </v>
<v Speaker 2>in class,</v>

881
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:32.973
<v Speaker 2>they could have taken a different stance</v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe would have had a little more </v>

882
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 2>legal positioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that fair to say?</v>

883
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.170
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets tricky because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a circuit split.</v>

884
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:41.263
<v Speaker 2>Get the supreme court back in 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 2>held that speech made pursuant to </v>

885
00:47:47.471 --> 00:47:48.304
<v Speaker 2>official job duties is basically speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's commissioned by the government </v>

886
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:52.834
<v Speaker 2>and therefore it does not have first </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment protection and you can be </v>

887
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:56.104
<v Speaker 2>fired for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did not decide whether or not </v>

888
00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:02.283
<v Speaker 2>that would relate to speech that relates</v>
<v Speaker 2>to scholarship or teaching as a supreme </v>

889
00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:06.904
<v Speaker 2>court put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is due to the special concern </v>

890
00:48:09.911 --> 00:48:10.744
<v Speaker 2>about academic freedom that we have for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons of faculty members being </v>

891
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 2>public intellectuals.</v>

892
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 2>The fourth circuit and the ninth circuit</v>
<v Speaker 2>where California is.</v>

893
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Have both said that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ruling,</v>

894
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.463
<v Speaker 2>that speech pursuant to official job </v>
<v Speaker 2>duties does not apply at colleges and </v>

895
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 2>universities to speech that relates to </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarship or teaching.</v>

896
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.210
<v Speaker 2>So in California she could have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected either way,</v>

897
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that way all around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

898
00:48:36.401 --> 00:48:41.401
<v Speaker 2>Some courts have declined to find that </v>
<v Speaker 2>exception to the 2006 garcia ruling.</v>

899
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Others have kind of ignored it for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time being.</v>

900
00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:46.024
<v Speaker 2>So one of these days the supreme court </v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably going to have to make </v>

901
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:51.160
<v Speaker 2>another decision on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious.</v>

902
00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I know you guys are a nonpartisan </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

903
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.470
<v Speaker 2>but if these decisions were left up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the states,</v>

904
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.800
<v Speaker 2>do you guys have a position on that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of itself?</v>

905
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have a personal position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does fire have a position on that?</v>

906
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our,</v>

907
00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:05.514
<v Speaker 2>our position is that the exception for </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarship or teaching absolutely </v>

908
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:10.780
<v Speaker 2>should be applied across the country.</v>

909
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:16.050
<v Speaker 2>It's really fundamentally important for </v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty members to be able to conduct,</v>

910
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial,</v>

911
00:49:19.631 --> 00:49:20.940
<v Speaker 2>disruptive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:25.950
<v Speaker 2>as it relates to the status quo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>research and writing without fearing for</v>

913
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:30.610
<v Speaker 2>their jobs because that's how we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get new ideas.</v>

914
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:33.880
<v Speaker 2>If you just talk about things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to rock the boat,</v>

915
00:49:33.881 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 2>if you just researched things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to rock the boat,</v>

916
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.270
<v Speaker 2>we're never going to get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need the bomb throwers.</v>

917
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.720
<v Speaker 2>There's room for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what about cases where,</v>

918
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:44.554
<v Speaker 2>and I guess this brings up a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to tenure because I think there </v>

919
00:49:46.961 --> 00:49:49.330
<v Speaker 2>is something interesting because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

920
00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:50.164
<v Speaker 2>I hear from professors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a ton of email from professors </v>

921
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.780
<v Speaker 2>saying that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love what we're doing here and that</v>

922
00:49:55.781 --> 00:49:59.490
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid sometimes tenured </v>
<v Speaker 2>professors are still afraid of the mob,</v>

923
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.820
<v Speaker 2>they know they're not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>fired,</v>

924
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.080
<v Speaker 2>but they'Re afraid of the mob.</v>

925
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Is there an inherent problem in tenure </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way now because you could,</v>

926
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:10.510
<v Speaker 2>if you have that protection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm all for saying whatever you want</v>

927
00:50:10.511 --> 00:50:13.630
<v Speaker 2>to say that technically if you were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>history history professor,</v>

928
00:50:13.631 --> 00:50:14.464
<v Speaker 2>let's say you could start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just start losing your mind </v>

929
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 2>and teaching really dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete reversal of the truth stuff.</v>

930
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:23.283
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have the protection of not being </v>

931
00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:28.860
<v Speaker 2>fired like that actually handicaps the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit of knowledge from,</v>

932
00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.140
<v Speaker 2>from the university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

933
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not terribly concerned about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because generally speaking,</v>

934
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.440
<v Speaker 2>there are ways for faculty to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplined or removed even with tenure.</v>

935
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Oftentimes for gross professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>competency issues.</v>

936
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:46.844
<v Speaker 2>if you are say teaching math and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching students that two plus two is </v>

938
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:56.300
<v Speaker 2>17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the common core you can,</v>

939
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:58.003
<v Speaker 2>there's ways that the university can </v>
<v Speaker 2>address that and that's not really what </v>

940
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:03.650
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing.</v>

941
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 2>What we're seeing more often is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

942
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:11.351
<v Speaker 2>the professor who's teaching physics who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is on the side of the holocaust denier a</v>

943
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.000
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

944
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:16.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe not necessarily teaching that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

945
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:21.221
<v Speaker 2>but does that have any ramifications for</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ability to teach physics?</v>

946
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:22.663
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a competency competency to </v>

947
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 2>teach the topic that you were hired to </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach thing.</v>

948
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it leaked into the classroom then</v>

949
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:32.480
<v Speaker 2>that then it's a separate issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

950
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:33.343
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are teaching a class on physics </v>

951
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:37.880
<v Speaker 2>and find some occasion to talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>holocaust,</v>

952
00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:38.714
<v Speaker 2>I think you're probably not teaching the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that you were hired and then it's </v>

953
00:51:41.301 --> 00:51:43.590
<v Speaker 2>up to the school to decide what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

954
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.433
<v Speaker 2>It's a different problem I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that indicates pretty </v>

955
00:51:48.621 --> 00:51:49.454
<v Speaker 2>squarely along with the denial of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>holocaust happened that you are in fact </v>

956
00:51:51.861 --> 00:51:53.840
<v Speaker 2>losing your right.</v>

957
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:54.853
<v Speaker 2>So what are some of the cases and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>one or two cases that you guys are </v>

958
00:51:57.801 --> 00:52:01.490
<v Speaker 2>working on right now or that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>your eye on right now that you think are</v>

959
00:52:01.491 --> 00:52:03.260
<v Speaker 2>particularly relevant that people should</v>
<v Speaker 2>know about?</v>

960
00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

961
00:52:04.301 --> 00:52:06.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>issued a press release this morning.</v>

962
00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:06.900
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

963
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.530
<v Speaker 2>just a mere hour or two before I came </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

964
00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:10.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at syracuse university where we sent a </v>

965
00:52:11.841 --> 00:52:13.130
<v Speaker 2>letter on friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

966
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.880
<v Speaker 2>this one is just bAnanas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

967
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Let me pause you for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read it yet,</v>

968
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.793
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to go to syracuse to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcasting because I wanted it to be </v>

969
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 2>like a news anchor or a or a sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

970
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Anchors road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want it to be.</v>

971
00:52:25.431 --> 00:52:26.264
<v Speaker 2>But there are big broadcasting school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm already fascinated by this as a </v>

972
00:52:29.451 --> 00:52:30.690
<v Speaker 2>place that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

973
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.640
<v Speaker 2>about disseminating information or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be glad you didn't hear this.</v>

974
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.473
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fraternity had an event every year </v>

975
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:44.240
<v Speaker 2>where the pledges or new members would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in.</v>

976
00:52:44.241 --> 00:52:45.074
<v Speaker 2>It was a private event and they would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>skits that roasted the other members of </v>

977
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:50.504
<v Speaker 2>the fraternity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fraternities have this kind of </v>

978
00:52:53.121 --> 00:52:55.960
<v Speaker 2>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that mine did,</v>

979
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.960
<v Speaker 2>but they went through some skits and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>

980
00:53:02.601 --> 00:53:03.434
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was making fun of a member of the </v>

981
00:53:05.301 --> 00:53:09.950
<v Speaker 2>fraternity who was unknown and vocal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump supporter and conservative.</v>

982
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.293
<v Speaker 2>So they satirized him by having somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was supposed to be him starting a </v>

983
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 2>rival fraternity that was quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 2>a white empire.</v>

984
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:22.010
<v Speaker 2>And to join people had to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrifically racist,</v>

985
00:53:22.011 --> 00:53:26.850
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic oath so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like it's all in good fun.</v>

986
00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it may be tasteless,</v>

987
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 2>but all good friends over and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the satirizing any.</v>

988
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 2>It's no different than you see comedians</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing all the time on a stage.</v>

989
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:38.360
<v Speaker 2>you're satirizing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

990
00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one was,</v>

991
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they satirized one of their brothers for</v>

992
00:53:44.011 --> 00:53:44.844
<v Speaker 2>being chronically whipped by his </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend and portrayed him as a </v>

993
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 2>mentally retarded and we had him in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheelchair and all that stuff.</v>

994
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:52.363
<v Speaker 2>And this was all on a private event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you hear the laughter in the </v>

995
00:53:55.471 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 2>audience indicated that nobody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really offended by it.</v>

996
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 2>They understood this is kinda just </v>
<v Speaker 2>poking fun at people.</v>

997
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.840
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that videos of it leaked </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the student newspaper,</v>

998
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 2>published them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

999
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 2>they had the right to do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be grudged than that,</v>

1000
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.120
<v Speaker 2>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you might imagine,</v>

1001
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:20.750
<v Speaker 2>outrage erupted and the within a matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>of days,</v>

1002
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:25.080
<v Speaker 2>the fraternity had been expelled </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanently from campus.</v>

1003
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:31.310
<v Speaker 2>18 students have been charged with </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplinary conduct or discipline,</v>

1004
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:32.363
<v Speaker 2>disciplinary code violations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're being threatened with </v>

1005
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.220
<v Speaker 2>suspension or expulsion and this is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1006
00:54:38.221 --> 00:54:39.054
<v Speaker 2>before finals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and meanwhile a adjunct faculty member </v>

1007
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:43.853
<v Speaker 2>had the gall to express concern about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how the university was handling all of </v>

1008
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:47.664
<v Speaker 2>this and they immediately told them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your views don't align with </v>

1009
00:54:50.971 --> 00:54:51.804
<v Speaker 2>ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are no longer qualified to teach at </v>

1010
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.230
<v Speaker 2>syracuse university.</v>

1011
00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's incredibly author authoritarian</v>

1012
00:54:58.831 --> 00:54:59.521
<v Speaker 2>sounding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1013
00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:00.354
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just willing to steamroll over </v>

1014
00:55:01.891 --> 00:55:06.891
<v Speaker 2>anybody who gets in their way in pursuit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of really just giving somebody a head on</v>

1015
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:10.130
<v Speaker 2>a pike so that the crowd is mollified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1016
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:11.463
<v Speaker 2>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've charged them with a sexual </v>

1017
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:16.890
<v Speaker 2>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminatory harassment.</v>

1018
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:18.043
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nevermind the fact that nobody who the </v>

1019
00:55:19.841 --> 00:55:24.841
<v Speaker 2>speech was actually intended for </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually was offended by it.</v>

1020
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.490
<v Speaker 2>It didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not their fault,</v>

1021
00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:30.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know how the videos lead,</v>

1022
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.193
<v Speaker 2>they're posting to a private facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>page and somebody must've had access to </v>

1023
00:55:34.771 --> 00:55:36.480
<v Speaker 2>somebody's computer or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1024
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 2>but the speech was purely private and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody was offended by it.</v>

1025
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.413
<v Speaker 2>And if every conversation between two </v>
<v Speaker 2>students can be the grounds for a </v>

1026
00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.393
<v Speaker 2>disciplinary investigation because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>third party later found out what was </v>

1027
00:55:51.151 --> 00:55:53.100
<v Speaker 2>said during that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1028
00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:55.320
<v Speaker 2>we don't be in jail.</v>

1029
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:56.663
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It reduces free speech to a complete </v>

1030
00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:01.710
<v Speaker 2>melody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1031
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1032
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1033
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:10.221
<v Speaker 2>it's galling and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just really a harsh and punitive bent of</v>

1034
00:56:10.531 --> 00:56:12.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the university and all of this is,</v>

1035
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.890
<v Speaker 2>is mystifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

1036
00:56:13.891 --> 00:56:14.724
<v Speaker 2>so just on the technical side now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is something good that </v>

1037
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:18.084
<v Speaker 2>trump's done related to this because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>got rid of a lot of the title nine </v>

1038
00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:23.170
<v Speaker 2>expansions and all that and devoss and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got rid of that stuff,</v>

1039
00:56:23.171 --> 00:56:24.700
<v Speaker 2>which I assume you agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1040
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1041
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:29.060
<v Speaker 2>it's stuff that we'd spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting against.</v>

1042
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So obama expanded it.</v>

1043
00:56:30.761 --> 00:56:31.594
<v Speaker 2>Trump got rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for the name and the name of </v>

1044
00:56:32.741 --> 00:56:33.574
<v Speaker 2>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear stories of like laura </v>

1045
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:35.770
<v Speaker 2>kipnis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I've had on and,</v>

1046
00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:36.683
<v Speaker 2>and many others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the witch hunts that happen that are </v>

1047
00:56:38.531 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1048
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 2>So these policies that they are saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these students violated,</v>

1049
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 2>these have nothing to do with government</v>
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>

1050
00:56:44.561 --> 00:56:44.981
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1051
00:56:44.981 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 2>they're saying they violated school </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>

1052
00:56:47.381 --> 00:56:48.214
<v Speaker 2>is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're discriminatory harassment </v>

1053
00:56:50.081 --> 00:56:50.914
<v Speaker 2>policies are obviously drawn on a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same language because they receive </v>

1054
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:58.060
<v Speaker 2>federal money in the form of student </v>
<v Speaker 2>loans and things like that.</v>

1055
00:56:58.061 --> 00:56:58.894
<v Speaker 2>So they actually still have to adhere to</v>
<v Speaker 2>title nine even though they're not a </v>

1056
00:57:00.821 --> 00:57:03.970
<v Speaker 2>state institution obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1057
00:57:03.971 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 2>they been charged with this laundry list</v>
<v Speaker 2>of offenses.</v>

1058
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

1059
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:10.990
<v Speaker 2>the administration has been rushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

1060
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:14.470
<v Speaker 2>trying to kind of get the process over </v>
<v Speaker 2>with as soon as possible.</v>

1061
00:57:14.471 --> 00:57:15.304
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not giving them really a lot of details </v>

1062
00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:20.290
<v Speaker 2>until just recently in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1063
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.690
<v Speaker 2>what the charges are based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all of this.</v>

1064
00:57:22.691 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very clearly a steam rolling and,</v>

1065
00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:27.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1066
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:28.210
<v Speaker 2>it's outrageous.</v>

1067
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1068
00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:30.004
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of the most recent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me a little bit about how you </v>

1069
00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:33.760
<v Speaker 2>guys get involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

1070
00:57:33.761 --> 00:57:34.594
<v Speaker 2>so you issue a press statement now or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>press release now they know they have a </v>

1071
00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:38.134
<v Speaker 2>little bit of public defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys actually work with the </v>

1072
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:42.610
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just kind of lay out how that whole</v>

1073
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:43.810
<v Speaker 2>process goes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1074
00:57:43.811 --> 00:57:44.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1075
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.353
<v Speaker 2>on our website we have a format anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>can fill out to request help and me and </v>

1076
00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:54.150
<v Speaker 2>my team every morning we will go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case submissions and uh,</v>

1077
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.270
<v Speaker 2>we'll review them and follow up for more</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentation if necessary.</v>

1078
00:57:58.271 --> 00:57:59.104
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get damn near close to a thousand of </v>

1079
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:01.210
<v Speaker 2>them a year now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1080
00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:06.211
<v Speaker 2>which is a whole lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we investigate and develop the cases</v>

1081
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:11.030
<v Speaker 2>and figure out what the best situ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1082
00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.740
<v Speaker 2>the best possible tactics in each case </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be a.</v>

1083
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.913
<v Speaker 2>Usually the next step involves writing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>letter telling the university which in </v>

1084
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:20.920
<v Speaker 2>syracuse case we sent that on friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling them,</v>

1085
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:22.900
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the applicable law,</v>

1086
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:27.640
<v Speaker 2>are these applicable norms that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be adhering to as though college,</v>

1087
00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's why what you're doing has run</v>

1088
00:58:30.491 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 2>a foul of all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>

1089
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll wait for a response in good faith </v>

1090
00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.093
<v Speaker 2>given university some time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge our concerns and work </v>

1091
00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:42.640
<v Speaker 2>through them and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1092
00:58:42.641 --> 00:58:44.650
<v Speaker 2>otherwise we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

1093
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:46.263
<v Speaker 2>issue a press release and start bringing</v>
<v Speaker 2>public pressure to bear sometimes in </v>

1094
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:50.794
<v Speaker 2>public college and university cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll take it to litigation if we have </v>

1095
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:55.483
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not every case obviously because you </v>

1096
00:58:56.981 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a range of cases that are,</v>

1097
00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:01.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make for a good lawsuit.</v>

1098
00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:02.104
<v Speaker 2>But even just recently filed a lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 2>at joliet junior college and this is </v>

1099
00:59:05.891 --> 00:59:06.724
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1100
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:07.563
<v Speaker 2>kind of flips the narrative a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was a students who saw a </v>

1101
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.393
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1102
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.473
<v Speaker 2>basically talking about how capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 2>is great and decided that she wanted to </v>

1103
00:59:17.021 --> 00:59:18.490
<v Speaker 2>make a good point about socialism.</v>

1104
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 2>So she handed out and flyers about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1105
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 2>it said shut down capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inviting people to like a workshop,</v>

1106
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:28.423
<v Speaker 2>a about socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was actually not far from where I </v>

1107
00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:33.530
<v Speaker 2>live in chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joliet junior college,</v>

1108
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.963
<v Speaker 2>and she was actually confronted by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of campus police officers who </v>

1109
00:59:39.921 --> 00:59:40.754
<v Speaker 2>pulled her to an interrogation room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demanded to examine the flyers and then </v>

1110
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:47.240
<v Speaker 2>confiscated them and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that here.</v>

1111
00:59:47.241 --> 00:59:47.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1112
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.680
<v Speaker 2>the political climate right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.673
<v Speaker 2>might start something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually shocked to hear it </v>

1114
00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:55.730
<v Speaker 2>happening that that story is not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse.</v>

1115
00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:58.520
<v Speaker 2>If this is an odd one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you used it as an example.</v>

1116
00:59:58.521 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1117
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 2>it goes to show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

1118
01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be interested to hear this.</v>

1119
01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1120
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.110
<v Speaker 2>my team and I actually did a really a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick analysis,</v>

1121
01:00:06.111 --> 01:00:06.944
<v Speaker 2>and this isn't scientific or anything of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the public cases that we've had on </v>

1122
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:12.314
<v Speaker 2>our website from the beginning of fires </v>
<v Speaker 2>history and actually more than half of </v>

1123
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:20.300
<v Speaker 2>them have nothing to do with politics.</v>

1124
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.930
<v Speaker 2>More than half of them are simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrators having power again.</v>

1125
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:28.543
<v Speaker 2>And when they have the power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will use it to regulate or silence </v>

1126
01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:33.734
<v Speaker 2>speech that they find inconvenient or </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical of the university or </v>

1127
01:00:37.191 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 2>administrators or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just kind of not nice,</v>

1128
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.313
<v Speaker 2>generally less than half of our cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to do with speakers being silenced </v>

1129
01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:48.404
<v Speaker 2>specifically because of the viewpoint </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're espousing on a political </v>

1130
01:00:52.131 --> 01:00:53.570
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1131
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:55.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of undoes a lot of the </v>

1132
01:00:57.051 --> 01:00:58.730
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be honest,</v>

1133
01:00:58.731 --> 01:01:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of a little bit tired of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>

1134
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 2>whether the right or left love </v>
<v Speaker 2>censorship,</v>

1135
01:01:03.141 --> 01:01:05.600
<v Speaker 2>more argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's completely unproductive and</v>

1136
01:01:05.601 --> 01:01:06.434
<v Speaker 2>does nothing to solve the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is we all need to understand why </v>

1137
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:14.270
<v Speaker 2>protecting free speech is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd mUch rather focus my time there.</v>

1138
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1139
01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:20.800
<v Speaker 2>so it's really that that whole narrative</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1140
01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 2>could use a little deconstructing for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

1141
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:27.350
<v Speaker 2>And I'm glad that we had that case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of allowed us to,</v>

1142
01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.213
<v Speaker 2>to show it and people appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of messages from people on </v>

1143
01:01:31.281 --> 01:01:32.001
<v Speaker 2>the right who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1144
01:01:32.001 --> 01:01:36.650
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with everything that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>young woman had to say.</v>

1145
01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 2>And I would sit there and now and yelled</v>
<v Speaker 2>at in her face,</v>

1146
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:42.283
<v Speaker 2>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm damn glad you guys stood up for her </v>

1147
01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:45.134
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1148
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>when I get messages like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1149
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.410
<v Speaker 2>it warms my heart and I get them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on both sides saying,</v>

1150
01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:52.244
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably wouldn't have reacted in the </v>

1151
01:01:54.771 --> 01:01:57.230
<v Speaker 2>same way you did leaping to a defense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech.</v>

1152
01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:00.260
<v Speaker 2>But I'm glad you did it because I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>something out of that.</v>

1153
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.091
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1154
01:02:01.091 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 2>it made me think about why my reaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that,</v>

1155
01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:06.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I,</v>

1156
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.500
<v Speaker 2>if I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can elicit that in people,</v>

1157
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I feel great about my day.</v>

1158
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the heavy lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1159
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.613
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a beautiful thing and that's why </v>

1160
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I did what you guys are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1161
01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 2>the thing I want to mention is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just remembered in this last moment that</v>

1162
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:23.640
<v Speaker 2>the reason that you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1163
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.980
<v Speaker 2>so I had wanted to have one of you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>on for about a year or so,</v>

1164
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 2>and you've been on our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our master list of all this.</v>

1165
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 2>And then I think about three months or </v>
<v Speaker 2>so ago,</v>

1166
01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:32.574
<v Speaker 2>someone tweeted at me that they were at </v>
<v Speaker 2>school at school library and they were </v>

1167
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 2>watching a video of me and ben shapiro </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they were reported to the,</v>

1168
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:46.500
<v Speaker 2>either the diversity office or one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that it was hate speech and</v>

1169
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:49.680
<v Speaker 2>that another student shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to watch these,</v>

1170
01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:51.040
<v Speaker 2>these evil things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1171
01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that this was in the uk,</v>

1172
01:02:53.671 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 2>so it was not under the jurisdiction </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you guys a cover,</v>

1173
01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.280
<v Speaker 2>which obviously is the United States.</v>

1174
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just shows that this thing,</v>

1175
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:06.630
<v Speaker 2>this monster that we're fighting is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>local to us here in America.</v>

1176
01:03:06.631 --> 01:03:07.464
<v Speaker 2>It's all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are other organizations like </v>

1177
01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 2>fire that do this work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1178
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:13.223
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And although it's depressing to know </v>

1179
01:03:14.251 --> 01:03:17.190
<v Speaker 2>that somebody is being reported for </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching a video that I put out there,</v>

1180
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.070
<v Speaker 2>it's good to know that you guys all came</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the rush.</v>

1181
01:03:20.071 --> 01:03:21.420
<v Speaker 2>You all came to the defense and you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1182
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 2>who is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we connect with them?</v>

1183
01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:23.723
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I connected them with some of your </v>

1184
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:24.601
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1185
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:28.940
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you've passed them on to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>with spikes over there.</v>

1186
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:29.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1187
01:03:29.831 --> 01:03:30.664
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it happening in Canada all the </v>

1188
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:33.660
<v Speaker 2>time in the uk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1189
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.410
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have google alerts set and every.</v>

1190
01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:38.483
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say every morning because </v>

1191
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:40.950
<v Speaker 2>it's more like 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>times a day.</v>

1192
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I get emails from google with the latest</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlines about free speech and it's not</v>

1193
01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:46.434
<v Speaker 2>just even the uk and Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are students protesting in India </v>

1194
01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:52.320
<v Speaker 2>about freedom of speech issues and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of countries.</v>

1195
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big conversation right now.</v>

1196
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:55.990
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1197
01:03:56.490 --> 01:04:00.240
<v Speaker 2>this is not limited to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not limited to anywhere.</v>

1198
01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:01.074
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that college campuses are kind </v>

1199
01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:07.030
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both a microcosm of society and a,</v>

1200
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 2>a training ground and an eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place where the ideas of the country,</v>

1201
01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:14.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of come from in a large sense.</v>

1202
01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.320
<v Speaker 2>That's a kind of a global,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concept.</v>

1203
01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's limited to higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>education in the United States.</v>

1204
01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:23.860
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1205
01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I really hope that we can convince </v>
<v Speaker 2>students that's where it's safeguarding.</v>

1206
01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1207
01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:33.000
<v Speaker 2>it's too important not to rel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said my friend,</v>
