19
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>years in radio and cable news now doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the digital thing,</v>

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>that you'd be sitting in a garage being </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed like this,</v>

21
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>going out to hundreds of thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people?</v>

22
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you the truth.</v>

23
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.140
<v Speaker 2>This is the pinnacle of my career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you'd have told me 61 years ago when </v>

24
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:21.261
<v Speaker 2>I started 61 years from today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be known around the world.</v>

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 2>You'll be called an icon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a living legend,</v>

26
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 2>and at the height of your career you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in a garage with David Ruben.</v>

27
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 2>It's come full circle.</v>

28
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It's killing me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry David.</v>

29
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>But what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that say about just how </v>

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>everything has changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 2>the only thing sures change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing constant is change.</v>

32
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.870
<v Speaker 2>When I started in radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had landlines,</v>

33
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 2>a webpro phone line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did starting regular,</v>

34
00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 2>did local television one year after I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started audio.</v>

35
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Always did both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always regarded both equally.</v>

36
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought of television is radio </v>

37
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.180
<v Speaker 2>with pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can be on a radio now.</v>

38
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we released this as an audio file.</v>

39
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have to see it.</v>

40
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could imagine.</v>

41
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:21.521
<v Speaker 2>And he's radio is theater of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always took it as just </v>

42
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 2>communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started in radio them,</v>

43
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 2>did local television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then did national radio and satellites.</v>

44
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I was there when satellites were </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced.</v>

45
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I never forgot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Washington,</v>

46
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 2>the guest is in La and it feels like </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's right there.</v>

47
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

48
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing saddle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said satellites.</v>

49
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the end that completes it.</v>

50
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Then Ted Turner hired me through CNN and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing around the world.</v>

51
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 2>We go up 23,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles to go next door and to Moscow.</v>

52
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Try to explain that to Jefferson doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot and now after 20 years,</v>

53
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.090
<v Speaker 2>almost 26 years at CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>61 years in the business I thought I </v>

54
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.901
<v Speaker 2>could retire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Follow slim came along so we go do </v>

55
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the internet or a TV or Hulu.</v>

56
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Who knew from this and when you tell me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Internet,</v>

57
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.460
<v Speaker 2>what bugs me is when a hill is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is the Internet and people talk </v>

58
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 2>about the Internet and I even though I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just have to accept it,</v>

59
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a product of all these things,</v>

60
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:34.141
<v Speaker 2>but basically David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am doing exactly what I did 61 years </v>

61
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:38.821
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're doing right now is no </v>

62
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:38.821
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

63
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:43.370
<v Speaker 2>we're being delivered differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we're doing and what does that </v>

64
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 2>say about this?</v>

65
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 2>The ability to sit across from somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look them in the eye and actually try to</v>

66
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:54.481
<v Speaker 2>understand the human experience because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying to you in the green room </v>

67
00:03:54.481 --> 00:03:57.331
<v Speaker 2>right before there is a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>renaissance right now because of </v>

68
00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about long form conversation,</v>

69
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>the thing that you've been doing for 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some ideas,</v>

70
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.070
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's happening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>

71
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not happening on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even on cable toe.</v>

72
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>They used to call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know MSNBC,</v>

73
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 2>CNN and Fox news channels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not new shells.</v>

74
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 2>They have prompt channels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is pro trump.</v>

75
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Anti trump won sometimes hate trump and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's pundits.</v>

76
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 24 hours a day of punditry.</v>

77
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 2>They do not cover the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the hurricane was hitting Carolina,</v>

78
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 2>it was in a box on the corner of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen.</v>

79
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 2>While we're talking about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saw where the hurricane was.</v>

80
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.730
<v Speaker 2>That's not news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember seeing a change on that </v>

81
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 2>because you were at CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember what year you started at </v>

82
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 2>the end?</v>

83
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 2>I started in 1985 and left in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember seeing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing in the way the news reported </v>

85
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 2>and the sword?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the other side started?</v>

86
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we owned it for a while,</v>

87
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 2>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was MSNBC,</v>

88
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 2>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fox,</v>

89
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 2>and we thought they were little </v>
<v Speaker 2>invaders.</v>

90
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Ted Turner was a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

91
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 2>an office pants genius of the seat of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pants.</v>

92
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 2>He was driving in a car one day and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy said,</v>

93
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 2>all news all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

94
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 2>why could not work on television?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he puts it up on the big bird.</v>

95
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Look what He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the revolutionary leader of the </v>

96
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.301
<v Speaker 2>second half of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Changes the world and look where it's </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know the different side.</v>

99
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 2>There's good and bad to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something happened in the world right</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.150

<v Speaker 2>Technology is always ahead of the human </v>

105
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 2>advance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when technology's ahead,</v>

106
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.470
<v Speaker 2>it's how do we grasp using this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great pie interview with Steve </v>

107
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Jobs when he started apple and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>wondering if he were here today,</v>

108
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.470
<v Speaker 2>if he would know what an impact that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>had in the world because I've had </v>

109
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 2>experts told me that your iphone will </v>
<v Speaker 2>control your life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was addicted to tobacco from age 17 to</v>

114
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 2>age 53 when I had a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what addiction is.</v>

115
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I would wake up in the morning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbed the cigarette before I put my </v>

<v Speaker 2>satellite.</v>

150
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I try to treat it as if they were there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I got used to handling well and</v>

151
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:26.981
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed was when I've had five different</v>
<v Speaker 2>guests in five different places and </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm in that moment.</v>

194
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't do anything about it.</v>

195
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.720

204
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.351
<v Speaker 3>yourself or was it built into you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've been out with you to lunch </v>

<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can see you're as curious about </v>

207
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:35.860
<v Speaker 3>the waiter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every busboy or sometime when we were at</v>

208
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:39.550
<v Speaker 3>ora together and you'd be chatting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy doing the lights or whatever,</v>

209
00:11:39.551 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Speaker 3>that you were actually as interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>them as if</v>

210
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Speaker 2>David.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember as a kid getting on a bus,</v>

211
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.560
<v Speaker 2>kip and asking the bus driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you want to drive a bus?</v>

212
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I remember we'd go to ball games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid in Brooklyn,</v>

213
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 2>go to dodger games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go with my friends.</v>

214
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 2>We'd wait outside for the players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted autographs.</v>

215
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I never want them in order to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to ask questions.</v>

216
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I would run along with a player going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>his car.</v>

217
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Why did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you bunt?</v>

218
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always a white person.</v>

219
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm the kind of person you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit next to on an airplane.</v>

220
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in sand.</v>

221
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where that came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best gift I got was </v>

222
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 2>curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gift of curiosity.</v>

223
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Quinn told me that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest gift ever.</v>

224
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Herby Cohen.</v>

225
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 2>You can negotiate anything says to me.</v>

226
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 2>The secret of my success is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

227
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that demeaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically what you're doing is saying,</v>

228
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 2>help me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Help me with this.</v>

229
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone asked me a few it interviewed or</v>

230
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:59.491
<v Speaker 2>some have been loud with your first </v>
<v Speaker 2>question a bit while it would not have </v>

<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you bomb the World Trade Center?</v>

232
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.640
<v Speaker 2>It would have been you grew up in one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the richest families in Saudi Arabia.</v>

233
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you leave now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably hadn't bought a lot since he</v>

234
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:23.071
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it forces you to think and then I'm </v>

235
00:13:23.071 --> 00:13:28.051
<v Speaker 2>going to learn more about him before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned about the bombing and also you </v>

236
00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:32.881
<v Speaker 2>have to understand that nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody thinks they're evil.</v>

237
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Hitler did not comb his hair in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and say,</v>

238
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I am a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may be crazy,</v>

239
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.240
<v Speaker 2>but they believe nobody thinks for </v>
<v Speaker 2>really terrible and everyone has an </v>

240
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 2>excuse for what they do.</v>

241
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 2>The bankruptcy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bank,</v>

242
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.480
<v Speaker 2>but my father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they charged his checking account that </v>

243
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.631
<v Speaker 2>screwed up and the public funding enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>admires the renegade.</v>

244
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Dylan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe was very popular in America.</v>

245
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He robbed from banks who likes banks.</v>

246
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you then interview a bad dude?</v>

247
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Someone that's got your curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're curious about a bad dude.</v>

248
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try not to.</v>

249
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.490
<v Speaker 2>It's hard sometimes racists especially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

250
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I had a tough time doing the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>George Wallace.</v>

251
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.910
<v Speaker 2>The later George Wallace was terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The early George was a tough time </v>

252
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 2>because I don't understand racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never understood it,</v>

253
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't have no understanding of why </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone would a different pigment.</v>

254
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.010
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should be treated differently.</v>

255
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.880
<v Speaker 2>You think that comes from just growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in Brooklyn and it is what?</v>

256
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.950
<v Speaker 2>It was such a medicaid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just talk about that a little </v>

257
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:49.950
<v Speaker 2>bit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what that was like growing up.</v>

258
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a neighborhood of making,</v>

259
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews,</v>

260
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Protestants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholics,</v>

261
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.670
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot,</v>

262
00:14:56.671 --> 00:15:01.671
<v Speaker 2>but blacks went to school at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went down to Miami to break into </v>

263
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:05.680
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 23 and I got off the train and the</v>

264
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 2>first thing I saw were two water </v>
<v Speaker 2>fountains,</v>

265
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.660
<v Speaker 2>colored white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drank out of it.</v>

266
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen anything like that.</v>

267
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.930
<v Speaker 2>You grew up in Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was beyond me.</v>

268
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Then I got on a bus to go over to Miami </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach to stay with my uncle and the bus </v>

269
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.331
<v Speaker 2>drivers stuffs the bus and asked me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move forward because the back is for </v>

270
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:32.990
<v Speaker 2>blacks and I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father's black,</v>

271
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll stay in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I never.</v>

272
00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I never understood it and I've asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>this a racist.</v>

273
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I have never understood why a wife feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>superior to a black.</v>

274
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a great friend of mine,</v>

275
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:51.251
<v Speaker 2>used to tell me that the human being has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have something they hate that drives </v>

276
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:57.761
<v Speaker 2>them because they have an inferiority </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex so they have to feel superior or</v>

277
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.530
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he told me 40 years ago,</v>

278
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Sunday blacks will get equal rights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have to hate something.</v>

279
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll hate eskimos.</v>

280
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 2>There's always another right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

281
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:17.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to check into a hotel and </v>

282
00:16:17.051 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 2>underneath the chair would be assigned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remove under penalty of law.</v>

283
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who removes him Eskimos,</v>

284
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he asked for a war.</v>

285
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

286
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't know name one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

287
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to google that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got an Eskimo doctor.</v>

288
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.870
<v Speaker 2>They would look for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just trying to find some and </v>

289
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.990
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always be photo.</v>

290
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed Dean Rusk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary of State Kennedy years,</v>

291
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 2>and he was a very progressive southerner</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Georgia.</v>

292
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.260
<v Speaker 2>His daughter married a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has.</v>

293
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no prejudice.</v>

294
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Seamless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They taught me a little about prejudice </v>

295
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.280
<v Speaker 2>of mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next Dean Rusk said to me,</v>

296
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 2>my daughter married a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had black grandchild.</v>

297
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I have no prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got on a commercial plane.</v>

298
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.800
<v Speaker 2>The pilot was black and for a minute I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was nervous that Sergio how inbred or </v>

299
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 2>can be can he fly the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never boggles me.</v>

300
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.530
<v Speaker 3>When you win over the years when you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to some of these people,</v>

301
00:17:22.531 --> 00:17:24.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white supremacists or just some of these</v>

302
00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:27.000
<v Speaker 3>people that come from that truly racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

303
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.700
<v Speaker 3>did you ever hear them say anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it almost like therapy in a way that</v>

304
00:17:32.701 --> 00:17:34.290
<v Speaker 3>you felt if you talk to them long </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

305
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.150
<v Speaker 3>maybe they could get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever.</v>

306
00:17:36.151 --> 00:17:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Since</v>

307
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:42.310
<v Speaker 2>you try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try the best you can now as some </v>

308
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.830
<v Speaker 2>books out by former white supremacists </v>
<v Speaker 2>who come full circle.</v>

309
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they raised a lot to do with </v>

310
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 2>raising as the major inferiority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to deal with that.</v>

311
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Although someone said it's not a complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>tear inferior.</v>

312
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Who were some of the people that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewed that,</v>

313
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you think either it went the wrong </v>

314
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 2>way or any regrets and never sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>down with somebody to go,</v>

315
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

349
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Speaker 2>When I interviewed Alma dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John and we're talking about various </v>

350
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.681
<v Speaker 2>things and we're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust and he says to me as well,</v>

351
00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I always have to listen when you do an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview.</v>

352
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.690
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was a holocaust,</v>

353
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:10.020
<v Speaker 2>why isn't Israel in Poland?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the crime occurred.</v>

354
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Why is the state of Israel 2000 miles </v>
<v Speaker 2>away?</v>

355
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 2>There was no crime in Palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crime was in Poland to Germany.</v>

356
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't they take that area and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to Israel?</v>

357
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made some sense.</v>

358
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.900
<v Speaker 2>You could argue with logically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

359
00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you say if there was a whole</v>

360
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.190
<v Speaker 2>and we went into just right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying if I,</v>

361
00:20:39.191 --> 00:20:41.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we got contentious,</v>

362
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 2>you deny was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are interesting,</v>

363
00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.720
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had so many years doing this,</v>

364
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Dave and I can't explain how I still </v>
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>

365
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.490
<v Speaker 2>I love the interplay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should love what you do not know why</v>

366
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.290
<v Speaker 2>you're learning something every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

367
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 2>So I can't be closed minded like I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal politically,</v>

368
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:16.230
<v Speaker 2>certainly in social issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not closed minded enough to </v>

369
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 2>think that you can have an opposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

370
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I liked the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the discussion,</v>

371
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 2>but in interviewing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never leave my ego at the door.</v>

372
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.700
<v Speaker 2>I try not to use the word I to relevant </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tried to get into walk in another.</v>

373
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 2>You know Edward Bennett Williams is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great lawyer.</v>

374
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Told me once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

375
00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:43.000
<v Speaker 2>what is the role of the criminal defense</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyer?</v>

376
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.470
<v Speaker 2>He said to get one person on the jury to</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk in your client's shoes,</v>

377
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 2>if you can get one person to walk in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your client's shoes,</v>

378
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 2>got a hung jury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All he has to do is say,</v>

379
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I would have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 3>When you were doing five nights a week </v>
<v Speaker 3>and on any good.</v>

381
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.970
<v Speaker 3>I use this example a lot because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>will say,</v>

382
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:09.870
<v Speaker 3>oh Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had this,</v>

383
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bad person on or this,</v>

384
00:22:13.111 --> 00:22:14.530
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing I'll say,</v>

385
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:15.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

386
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.810
<v Speaker 3>in Larry King's Hay day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go 1992 CNN.</v>

387
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.150
<v Speaker 3>You'd have the cast of friends on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday,</v>

388
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.330
<v Speaker 3>you'd have an Oj Simpson lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On Tuesday you'd have,</v>

389
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an animal guy on Wednesday you'd have,</v>

390
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a doctor on,</v>

391
00:22:29.191 --> 00:22:32.730
<v Speaker 3>on Thursday and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>former secretary of state on Friday.</v>

392
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Was that crazy for you?</v>

393
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.120
<v Speaker 2>You just love the bounce part of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity.</v>

394
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the Times,</v>

395
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.400
<v Speaker 2>most of the times driving in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I had on that night.</v>

396
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still don't know Laura.</v>

397
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I drive in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's on.</v>

398
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Unless it was really someone famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we might have the animal guy I </v>

399
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.981
<v Speaker 2>didn't know until I walk in and see all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the animals and because my curiosity </v>

400
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.200
<v Speaker 2>comes from pure curiosity.</v>

401
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.740
<v Speaker 3>So were your guys hand and you know.</v>

402
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

403
00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I get a blue card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a blue card with fax.</v>

404
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was secretary of state from year.</v>

405
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.020
<v Speaker 2>She ended that year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was responsible for the Marshall </v>

406
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

407
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.320
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would do the things that are </v>

408
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Speaker 2>the Marshall Plan came about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

409
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.170
<v Speaker 2>How we're part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you play with George Marshall?</v>

410
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Was his plan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you in on the thinking?</v>

411
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all when when we have the Gulf War,</v>

412
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I would see other shows in which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests would come on and be general or </v>

413
00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.580
<v Speaker 2>something and the host would say today </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Gulf War,</v>

414
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:47.300
<v Speaker 2>1000 people were killed and the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now terrain is here and all I would </v>

415
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 2>say is what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened today?</v>

416
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Because he has the perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have an interview where you turn </v>

417
00:23:57.111 --> 00:24:02.030
<v Speaker 2>the TV on and the host is on more than a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guest,</v>

418
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.030
<v Speaker 2>something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>

419
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.890
<v Speaker 2>If it takes you three sentences to ask a</v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

420
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 2>something's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of them are show offs.</v>

421
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the show off interviewer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

422
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess today is Dave Rubin.</v>

423
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:21.830
<v Speaker 2>He's written a new book called Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My hometown.</v>

424
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Been great to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave.</v>

425
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 1>You know I visited Chicago many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always loved going there.</v>

426
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you.</v>

427
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you write about the stock yard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

428
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.350
<v Speaker 1>or stuck study as a fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever go to that folks in other.</v>

429
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you are a prop for me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gone now though.</v>

430
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 1>There aren't even low shows anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

431
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.390
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you left at the end,</v>

432
00:24:45.391 --> 00:24:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and I've said this to you before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>left in 2010,</v>

433
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.590
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me you can do a pretty clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>line between you leaving Sienna and </v>

434
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.550
<v Speaker 1>obviously the piers Morgan thing didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work out.</v>

435
00:24:55.551 --> 00:24:59.000
<v Speaker 1>If you want to comment on how you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you were one of the people that</v>

436
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:03.800
<v Speaker 1>people trusted that there's almost no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one in news or on television anymore,</v>

437
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:04.610
<v Speaker 1>that people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

438
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:09.990
<v Speaker 1>like no one was walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the people that maybe didn't like </v>

439
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.341
<v Speaker 1>it that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to Larry King's a bad </v>

440
00:25:12.341 --> 00:25:12.341
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry King's a liar.</v>

441
00:25:12.341 --> 00:25:16.061
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was doing that by having one of </v>

442
00:25:16.061 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 1>the main faces who had been there for so</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

443
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I really think it broke something in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuity of CNN that kind of led us to</v>

444
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:24.090
<v Speaker 1>where we are now related to all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable.</v>

445
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it did.</v>

446
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 2>There were signs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

447
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:31.631
<v Speaker 2>Fox News was beating us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had one at all those years and Fox </v>

448
00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.120
<v Speaker 2>News was beating and beating cnn the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

449
00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:37.680
<v Speaker 2>beating us at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a sign.</v>

450
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.830
<v Speaker 2>This was a network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does Not News,</v>

451
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but am I making this up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you left CNN,</v>

452
00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:43.490
<v Speaker 1>you still at the highest rated show</v>

453
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.020
<v Speaker 2>on the second highest week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started,</v>

454
00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:46.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall.</v>

455
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Not precipitously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we started a fall.</v>

456
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 2>We sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can sort of infancy Saudian was CNN </v>

457
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.670
<v Speaker 2>always made a ton of money for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have first and everybody in </v>

458
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.690
<v Speaker 2>America had CNN paid fifty cents a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>

459
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:05.880
<v Speaker 2>So Ted Turner that in on a genius </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking this right now,</v>

460
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:11.010
<v Speaker 2>you and I are paying for CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not watching it.</v>

461
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't pay for cvs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pay him for it.</v>

462
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.960
<v Speaker 2>He knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So cnn made money.</v>

463
00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 2>If they had no commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything.</v>

464
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Just beyond public tune in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world now.</v>

465
00:26:27.241 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

466
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was the cleavage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Seinfeld said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my old column I used to do in usa today </v>

468
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.070
<v Speaker 2>when I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my two cents.</v>

469
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.200
<v Speaker 2>That was the beginning of twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

470
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Really quick comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

471
00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:44.150
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

472
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people call me a pioneer,</v>

473
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:46.850
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

474
00:26:46.851 --> 00:26:51.851
<v Speaker 2>all I see myself is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lucky Jewish kid from Brooklyn who</v>

475
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:58.191
<v Speaker 2>was curious and that curiosity into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>career as I was able to take the natural</v>

476
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 2>curiosity and make a career of it.</v>

477
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.770
<v Speaker 1>You think we're maybe running out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you,</v>

478
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.130
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to younger than you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be very young sons.</v>

479
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 1>When you talk to young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch how they get the news.</v>

480
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:16.450
<v Speaker 1>You were telling me about kids with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones and everything and you've.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

497
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.030
<v Speaker 2>The best thing about being a sports fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

498
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.970
<v Speaker 2>It's the one thing in your life when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get up in the morning,</v>

499
00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:03.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't know who's going to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have something to look forward </v>

500
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.180
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good or bad.</v>

501
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.930
<v Speaker 2>You don't know who's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wakes up with that.</v>

502
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Sports fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing,</v>

503
00:28:10.541 --> 00:28:15.541
<v Speaker 2>what I love about athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more than any professional,</v>

<v Speaker 2>their career is over when other careers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning they have that day when </v>

<v Speaker 2>you want that slide.</v>

506
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.110
<v Speaker 2>You build yourself up and you're 37 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

507
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.560
<v Speaker 2>They paid you all this money for doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you did as a kid and another thing </v>

508
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.971
<v Speaker 2>the athlete has that we don't have final</v>
<v Speaker 2>score can argue that's it.</v>

509

<v Speaker 2>Eight to seven.</v>

<v Speaker 2>when George Bush loss to Bill Clinton at</v>

553
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:33.031
<v Speaker 2>3:00</v>

00:31:33.031 --> 00:31:33.031
<v Speaker 2>going to lose and they're all sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>around summer.</v>

555
00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Barbara Bush came in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do we get a driver's license?</v>

556
00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.850
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>

557
00:31:40.851 --> 00:31:45.851
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just did something that we've never </v>

558
00:31:45.851 --> 00:31:47.441
<v Speaker 2>done on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We stopped for a moment so that Alexis </v>

559
00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:50.750
<v Speaker 2>could bring you a chocolate shake in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the show.</v>

560
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Normally someone with diabetes heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish and not have a chocolate Mocha.</v>

561
00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:01.290
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost weight and I don't know why </v>

562
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.560
<v Speaker 2>they say it comes with aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have tried to have a daily milkshake </v>

563
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.140
<v Speaker 2>to not lose anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a call back to Brooklyn,</v>

564
00:32:09.141 --> 00:32:10.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>the candy store.</v>

566
00:32:15.021 --> 00:32:17.030

<v Speaker 2>about at some level.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>

575
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm this age.</v>

579
00:32:51.121 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 1>a couple of things and you're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

580
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:57.731
<v Speaker 1>You're doing your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're out and about every morning I </v>

581
00:32:57.731 --> 00:32:57.731
<v Speaker 1>bump into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the time</v>

582
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.660
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

583
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.850
<v Speaker 2>is the reason I'm around is that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a purpose.</v>

584
00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I am amazed that people who retire as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Milton Berle told me once when I asked </v>

585
00:33:09.811 --> 00:33:10.740
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to retire?</v>

586
00:33:10.741 --> 00:33:15.741
<v Speaker 2>And he said to what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would I do if I get up in the </v>

587
00:33:15.931 --> 00:33:17.310
<v Speaker 2>morning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had nothing to do.</v>

588
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 2>That's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a place to go to follow my </v>

589
00:33:23.431 --> 00:33:26.340
<v Speaker 2>profession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's wonderful.</v>

590
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 2>If you can keep that going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably die on the air.</v>

591
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll someone asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you like?</v>

592
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.090
<v Speaker 2>You really want to increase?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Youtube view is right now.</v>

593
00:33:39.091 --> 00:33:44.091
<v Speaker 2>Came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you like your obituary to </v>

594
00:33:44.091 --> 00:33:47.690
<v Speaker 2>read?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said the oldest man who ever lived</v>

595
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.120
<v Speaker 2>passed away today and his sleep with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>smile on his face,</v>

596
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.960
<v Speaker 1>but you still get a kick out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

597
00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I know it so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just real quick to tell everybody a </v>

598
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:00.450
<v Speaker 1>little bit about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have these breakfasts with your.</v>

599
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:04.250
<v Speaker 2>well some of them have passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

601
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:09.251
<v Speaker 2>I grew up with in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have a crew of about five or six </v>

602
00:34:09.251 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 2>we made every day at different places </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we attained a to David.</v>

603
00:34:12.621 --> 00:34:14.920
<v Speaker 2>We solve the problems of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

604
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.850
<v Speaker 2>We solved the wrap.</v>

605
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

606
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No worries about Iraq.</v>

607
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 2>The table solved mostly through jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The jokes that we talked about,</v>

608
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 2>people getting in arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about Israel,</v>

609
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 2>we talk about hearings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's this,</v>

610
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.980
<v Speaker 2>what's this senator doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's he doing?</v>

611
00:34:33.981 --> 00:34:38.981
<v Speaker 2>And then we also discuss Sinatra and old</v>
<v Speaker 2>time musicians and who's doing what and </v>

612
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:45.851
<v Speaker 2>what and Barbara streisand make on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>last tour and so we never know where the</v>

613
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:49.880
<v Speaker 2>discussion is going and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful.</v>

614
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And when you going to have friends from </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>

615
00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Two of mine have passed away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still have to others.</v>

616
00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.160
<v Speaker 2>The best thing about it is</v>

617
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Larry King and Larry Soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my first name and they're very </v>

618
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:12.881
<v Speaker 1>happy for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still a button.</v>

619
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Your buttons on your shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

620
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't treat you like anything </v>

621
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.561
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it like as somebody of a certain </v>

622
00:35:23.561 --> 00:35:27.731
<v Speaker 1>age now where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just mentioned you've lost some </v>

623
00:35:27.731 --> 00:35:30.700
<v Speaker 1>childhood friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brother passed away just last year </v>

624
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:30.700
<v Speaker 1>or so months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

625
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm just watching life turn in that way.</v>

626
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As Sinatra told me once,</v>

627
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 2>the saddest about aging is your friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>go before you.</v>

628
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:46.340
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother had died before me know your </v>

629
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 2>younger brother and he was 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 80.</v>

630
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:54.080
<v Speaker 2>He lost his hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because I don't believe in </v>

631
00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.350
<v Speaker 2>afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not religious.</v>

632
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

633
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've interviewed thousands of people.</v>

634
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 2>People who said they've seen death and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

635
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a little.</v>

636
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

637
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:15.170
<v Speaker 2>It just makes no sense to me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln is up there or that there's </v>

638
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:20.630
<v Speaker 2>someone up there looking down on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to my grandchildren's.</v>

639
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 2>They're twins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy and a girl.</v>

640
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:27.690
<v Speaker 2>So they had a bot and a bar Mitzvah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for the first time in ages,</v>

641
00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:32.691
<v Speaker 2>I read from the Old Testament that God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the son of a bitch cheese.</v>

642
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Did he hate it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>

643
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.230
<v Speaker 2>My Enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lou out the show me one good pen.</v>

644
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in me.</v>

645
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Above me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was vain.</v>

646
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a Donald Trump before there was a</v>

647
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump believe in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Above all others.</v>

648
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 2>I am the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe so when I read that,</v>

649
00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe so I can't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've interviewed all the great religious</v>

650
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:04.080
<v Speaker 2>leaders except pope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been convinced.</v>

651
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:05.490
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you've sat down,</v>

652
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I sat down with everybody from the Dalai</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lama across the board with Bray Graham </v>

653
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.120
<v Speaker 2>was a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

654
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 2>So when you sat down with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't believe it,</v>

655
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.440
<v Speaker 2>did you feel that some of them were able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get something out of belief?</v>

656
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I believe they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

657
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Unless there was some nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>cross gonna buy any of that.</v>

659
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Sat Down with some of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do Jerry Falwell since,</v>

660
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.820
<v Speaker 2>as George Burns once said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he played God,</v>

661
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a great movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great movie,</v>

662
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he got us all the religious leaders </v>

663
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.300
<v Speaker 2>and he calls into Jerry Falwell type and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall type.</v>

664
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Go See.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call me in.</v>

665
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:51.441
<v Speaker 2>First goes up to his room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sits down and God says to him,</v>

666
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 2>why don't you sold shoes?</v>

667
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.190
<v Speaker 2>So I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never bought that part,</v>

668
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.320
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked billy Graham respected,</v>

669
00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:00.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billy grand,</v>

670
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.960
<v Speaker 2>thought I was very spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do I believe billy is with Jesus </v>

671
00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.430
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

672
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:12.230
<v Speaker 2>But bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed he believed he was going to </v>

673
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no fear.</v>

674
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Death had a fear of being in a plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gone down to crash,</v>

675
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't fear death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feared I like Woody Allen.</v>

676
00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't fear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to be there.</v>

677
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe my wife believes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect believers.</v>

678
00:38:29.831 --> 00:38:34.831
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I approach an interview with Billy </v>

679
00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:34.831
<v Speaker 2>Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect him.</v>

680
00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I asked him best questions I could ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

681
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 2>why do you need to stay at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fontainebleau?</v>

682
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Or I've quoted Lenny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Timm.</v>

683
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Any person who's got a calling from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord to lead the flock who has more than</v>

684
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 2>one suit while someone has no clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a cop out.</v>

685
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.670
<v Speaker 2>And Billy Graham said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in today's world,</v>

686
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.870
<v Speaker 2>you have to have more than one suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to travel.</v>

687
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I asked him if Christ Jesus probably had</v>
<v Speaker 2>one pair of flip flops,</v>

688
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 2>crease would Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will he buy suits?</v>

689
00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:14.530
<v Speaker 2>And he said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would go on television.</v>

690
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 2>That was a means of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

691
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's their answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he believed it.</v>

692
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I respected his belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not afraid to ask them any </v>

693
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.680
<v Speaker 2>question if when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in Jesus Christ,</v>

694
00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:32.290
<v Speaker 2>you will live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens to the Jews?</v>

695
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.450
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

696
00:39:36.451 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go into them,</v>

697
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:41.140
<v Speaker 2>but maybe at the moment of their death </v>
<v Speaker 2>they accept Christ.</v>

698
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.540
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a cop out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always sort of another answer.</v>

699
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever talk to anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either religious or otherwise,</v>

700
00:39:49.291 --> 00:39:52.660
<v Speaker 1>that you felt had some sort of special </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight into some of the.</v>

701
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Does Dr Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was convinced that he had died,</v>

702
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.580
<v Speaker 2>visited what the world of afterlife was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then his life was saved.</v>

703
00:39:59.581 --> 00:40:03.330
<v Speaker 2>He was recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr You know what disease he had.</v>

704
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I threw it up to a vivid imagination and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ain't got a best selling book out of it.</v>

705
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.270
<v Speaker 2>People want to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

706
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I wished that I had faith that I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

707
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.710
<v Speaker 2>It's called a leap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faith can't prove it,</v>

708
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.720
<v Speaker 2>so it's a leap of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have faith in a lot of things.</v>

709
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:30.110
<v Speaker 2>You get on an airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the faith that that airplane </v>

710
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.730
<v Speaker 2>company hired a licensed pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I punch you.</v>

711
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Have some core belief that you think if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you jump out of the 10th floor of a </v>

712
00:40:39.541 --> 00:40:42.570
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to make it so you don't</v>

713
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:47.690
<v Speaker 2>trump the people who have that faith who</v>
<v Speaker 2>go beyond.</v>

714
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:55.290
<v Speaker 2>I just think they've got a great crutch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg Crutch to know you're going </v>

715
00:40:56.881 --> 00:40:57.670
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

716
00:40:57.671 --> 00:40:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

717
00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.980
<v Speaker 1>But at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think it matters if they,</v>

718
00:40:59.981 --> 00:41:02.050
<v Speaker 1>if they live a good life and you live a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good life?</v>

719
00:41:02.051 --> 00:41:03.340
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never gotten to know.</v>

720
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they go somewhere they were right.</v>

721
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>If they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know because they did,</v>

722
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.830
<v Speaker 1>so they got a good deal going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really have a good deal.</v>

723
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an RBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I've got an afterlife,</v>

724
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll be shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you'll be doing this.</v>

725
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was absolute.</v>

726
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you'll be playing baseball up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

727
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that good decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

728
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.810
<v Speaker 1>let's talk a little bit about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned trump.</v>

729
00:41:28.811 --> 00:41:31.270
<v Speaker 1>We did about 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name didn't even come up once.</v>

730
00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.230
<v Speaker 1>First Time in American conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any</v>

731
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:39.250
<v Speaker 2>two people had a conversation for 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes in the name trump that that's </v>

732
00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:43.661
<v Speaker 2>one thing he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll bet you everyone in America at one </v>

733
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 2>time today said the name trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

734
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone else that in the years </v>

735
00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:53.170
<v Speaker 2>that you've been doing this that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw?</v>

736
00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:57.941
<v Speaker 2>Just that effect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the only president that I've known </v>

737
00:41:57.941 --> 00:42:01.511
<v Speaker 2>for 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met the other presidents some before </v>

738
00:42:01.511 --> 00:42:05.600
<v Speaker 2>they became President Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Bush,</v>

739
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were in the political sphere,</v>

740
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:14.620
<v Speaker 2>but trump is the only one that was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend before trump and I went to the </v>

741
00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.061
<v Speaker 2>superbowl together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk about what I will fathers </v>

742
00:42:19.061 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 2>of the year together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a 1995?</v>

743
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:22.430
<v Speaker 2>He had his kids and my kids as all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his story.</v>

744
00:42:22.431 --> 00:42:25.140
<v Speaker 2>We got trophies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

745
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I went to see Marla maples in her </v>
<v Speaker 2>Broadway show.</v>

746
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I went with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stayed at hotels when I had some minor</v>

747
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:36.860
<v Speaker 2>surgery in New York.</v>

748
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 2>He took my wife out to dinner the night </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

749
00:42:39.051 --> 00:42:44.051
<v Speaker 2>He caught me at every hotel he owned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put me in a suite at the plaza when he </v>

750
00:42:44.051 --> 00:42:47.621
<v Speaker 2>owned the plaza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one thing we always knew about </v>

751
00:42:47.621 --> 00:42:48.170
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a character and he lied.</v>

752
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Now he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he almost lined by,</v>

753
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 2>it's snowing out when it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

754
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 2>he'd be on my show and say highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>rating and it was all about him,</v>

755
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.160
<v Speaker 2>but he was a character and it was fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he could be very nice and generous.</v>

756
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had all those qualities,</v>

757
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.650
<v Speaker 2>but he was a character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

758
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:11.651
<v Speaker 2>he would call up the New York Post with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a different name and tell them stories </v>

759
00:43:11.781 --> 00:43:14.210
<v Speaker 2>about Donald Trump so we can get on page</v>
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>

760
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.360
<v Speaker 2>That was his goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but precedent precedent.</v>

761
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody,</v>

762
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:24.080
<v Speaker 2>any of us who knew him years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

763
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:29.410
<v Speaker 2>he was a moderate to central Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supported Hillary Clinton,</v>

764
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.830
<v Speaker 2>loved Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought she was a great senator.</v>

765
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:39.380
<v Speaker 2>He wanted single payer health care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't care about abortion.</v>

766
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evangelicals.</v>

767
00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Donald ever read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

768
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:51.380
<v Speaker 2>But he was a friendly character to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>around our wonderful guest.</v>

769
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fly off the top,</v>

770
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.440
<v Speaker 2>but precedent precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you make about what happened </v>

771
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.880
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have no idea what Hillary was.</v>

772
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:03.530
<v Speaker 2>A bad candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wonderful person.</v>

773
00:44:03.531 --> 00:44:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I Know Hillary very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great sense of humor.</v>

774
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what her.</v>

775
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.280
<v Speaker 2>She didn't go to Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a different hillary when you </v>

776
00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:14.600
<v Speaker 2>went into her interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her publicly.</v>

777
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.040
<v Speaker 2>This is what a lot of her is that she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very friendly and open.</v>

778
00:44:18.041 --> 00:44:19.400
<v Speaker 2>The one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's good.</v>

779
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Front of an audience.</v>

780
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:22.530
<v Speaker 2>She's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not a good.</v>

781
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:28.360
<v Speaker 2>She's running for something now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a Yom Kippur service where she</v>

782
00:44:28.611 --> 00:44:29.330
<v Speaker 2>was the speaker.</v>

783
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.260
<v Speaker 2>She was terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't running for anything.</v>

784
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>She was a senator from New York and damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>good center,</v>

785
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:39.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she ran a horrendous campaign and she </v>

786
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 2>was not a good campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought she won the debates,</v>

787
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:48.320
<v Speaker 2>but it almost didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump became with some got elected with </v>

788
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:53.361
<v Speaker 2>that first question in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican debate when he was asked </v>

789
00:44:53.361 --> 00:44:55.470
<v Speaker 2>about women and did he ever call women </v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs?</v>

790
00:44:55.471 --> 00:45:00.471
<v Speaker 2>And he said only Rosie O'donnell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he sat in the middle of all the </v>

791
00:45:00.471 --> 00:45:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did they see them in the middle?</v>

792
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:07.150
<v Speaker 2>It was just four on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you really think at the end from </v>

793
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 2>that moment that he thought he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignite something?</v>

794
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:12.960
<v Speaker 2>But I thought he was dead when he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about mccain isn't a hero.</v>

795
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Certainly when he got off the bus with </v>
<v Speaker 2>billy Bush,</v>

796
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his base doesn't care if </v>

797
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:26.451
<v Speaker 2>evangelicals can put aside his personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

798
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:33.460
<v Speaker 2>He'll never lose them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll never saw it.</v>

799
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I've never lived in weird at times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

800
00:45:36.481 --> 00:45:40.640
<v Speaker 2>this is the weirdest time to every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

801
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:41.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a story.</v>

802
00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Does this truly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in all your years,</v>

803
00:45:42.921 --> 00:45:46.070
<v Speaker 3>does this right now feel like a truly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly unique time?</v>

804
00:45:46.071 --> 00:45:48.230
<v Speaker 3>Because people ask me that a of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>

805
00:45:48.231 --> 00:45:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the answer is yes.</v>

806
00:45:49.821 --> 00:45:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Although you always think that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're living it,</v>

807
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.490
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your perspective.</v>

808
00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:58.491
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said one day to see what </v>

809
00:45:58.491 --> 00:46:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln Center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To hear what?</v>

810
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Roseville dig less night to see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

811
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.000
<v Speaker 2>The Carter mate that he went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that weird?</v>

812
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't do weird things.</v>

813
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:18.230
<v Speaker 2>They were president that I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the White House interviewing </v>

814
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:22.341
<v Speaker 2>George Bush and Barbara Bush said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry suspenders and the White House,</v>

815
00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:28.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was at the White House's place is </v>

816
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.761
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what it's like in their </v>

817
00:46:31.761 --> 00:46:34.730
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy writes the op Ed piece in the </v>

818
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.730
<v Speaker 2>New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>

819
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.630
<v Speaker 2>the world would book fascinating book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're living in those times.</v>

820
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.740
<v Speaker 2>What would it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't believe it,</v>

821
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:46.610
<v Speaker 3>but I can see as you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a glimmer in your eye like </v>

822
00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.521
<v Speaker 3>there's something exciting about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that's in a weird way </v>

823
00:46:49.521 --> 00:46:51.600
<v Speaker 3>the the good part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's kind of helter skelter now.</v>

824
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

825
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I'm not on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

826
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to be doing panels </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday and trump all the time.</v>

827
00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the whole world.</v>

828
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Trump's not the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks he's still</v>

829
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:09.140
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think politics actually is </v>

830
00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:09.840
<v Speaker 3>because I think now there's maybe what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm realizing now is that this is really</v>

831
00:47:09.841 --> 00:47:12.030
<v Speaker 3>about culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're fighting right now,</v>

832
00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:17.031
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this battle that seems to be in points </v>

833
00:47:17.031 --> 00:47:17.031
<v Speaker 3>about culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about what do we really care about?</v>

834
00:47:17.031 --> 00:47:20.601
<v Speaker 3>What do we like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just about the INS and outs and </v>

835
00:47:20.601 --> 00:47:20.601
<v Speaker 3>machinations of</v>

836
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Speaker 2>too much of America is still prejudiced </v>
<v Speaker 2>against Latinos.</v>

837
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That still runs through a lot of this,</v>

838
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:36.270
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people voting against their own self </v>

839
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's face it,</v>

840
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:45.151
<v Speaker 2>with some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obamacare is working for a lot of </v>

841
00:47:45.151 --> 00:47:49.681
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't hear many complaints about people </v>

842
00:47:49.681 --> 00:47:51.100
<v Speaker 2>who are under it and getting good </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical care.</v>

843
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that I love to do away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

844
00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 2>It was just those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those kinds of facts are sort of bothers</v>

845
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:04.501
<v Speaker 2>me when I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why we still have prejudice in America </v>

846
00:48:05.081 --> 00:48:07.450
<v Speaker 2>and appeal to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

847
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:12.510
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even his defendant would say he appeals </v>

848
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we need a.</v>

849
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 2>We need a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think?</v>

850
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a play by him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

851
00:48:16.481 --> 00:48:19.330
<v Speaker 2>for all the years that you knew him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you think he was racist or that this</v>

852
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:20.950
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought he was racist.</v>

853
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he was opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

854
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:29.700
<v Speaker 2>He took advantage of a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we used to say he wasn't smart.</v>

855
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:36.300
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't book smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet at at school he got gentlemen see </v>

856
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:44.490
<v Speaker 2>the big influences in his life or Roy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cohn who I knew very well and his </v>

857
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were bad influences.</v>

858
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rog Roy Cohn was,</v>

859
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I liked them closing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was peculiar,</v>

860
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:56.810
<v Speaker 2>but he was waiting for the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know who right going is.</v>

861
00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:01.950
<v Speaker 2>He was a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was part of the mccarthy era and </v>

862
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.890
<v Speaker 2>angels in America had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he played a part in that play,</v>

863
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was affected by that.</v>

864
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.480
<v Speaker 2>So I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought he was a racist,</v>

865
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:19.050
<v Speaker 2>but his narcissism was beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in every other sentence,</v>

866
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

867
00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm the greatest president we've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

868
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just say that.</v>

869
00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:35.550
<v Speaker 2>How could you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were sitting down with him,</v>

870
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I would say Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

871
00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.170
<v Speaker 2>I spoke to them everyday during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>

872
00:49:40.171 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 2>but not every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a week during the campaign,</v>

873
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:47.630
<v Speaker 2>he knew I was voting for Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were friends and he would call </v>

874
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.630
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is?</v>

875
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of that?</v>

876
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I got this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

877
00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:55.641
<v Speaker 2>It is something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do an interview with the </v>

878
00:49:55.641 --> 00:49:55.641
<v Speaker 2>New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

879
00:49:55.641 --> 00:49:55.641
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I do this?</v>

880
00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.240
<v Speaker 2>And then when he was elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never heard from him again.</v>

881
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we can get out of this </v>

882
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.961
<v Speaker 2>polarization that we seem to be in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we're in this unique time right </v>

883
00:50:11.961 --> 00:50:12.390
<v Speaker 2>now in crazy time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's it going to change?</v>

884
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have,</v>

885
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forcefully to.</v>

886
00:50:21.031 --> 00:50:26.031
<v Speaker 2>It might be Bloomberg to lead us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need someone</v>

887
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.400
<v Speaker 3>to lead us out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need Gary Cooper.</v>

888
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Maybe George Clooney in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

889
00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:40.451
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Clooney a bright and he is </v>

890
00:50:40.451 --> 00:50:43.930
<v Speaker 3>bright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Clooney wouldn't be very pumping </v>

891
00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.070
<v Speaker 3>women's vote smart as a whip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that tell you though?</v>

892
00:50:49.231 --> 00:50:51.000
<v Speaker 3>If we need to go to celebrities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think?</v>

893
00:50:51.001 --> 00:50:53.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we're just in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

894
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the world we live in.</v>

895
00:50:58.860 --> 00:50:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.800
<v Speaker 2>I like Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd vote for him.</v>

897
00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do you think we can get out of this,</v>

898
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:05.800
<v Speaker 3>this thing?</v>

899
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say a motorcycle always comes </v>

900
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:11.430
<v Speaker 2>through everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George will,</v>

901
00:51:11.431 --> 00:51:16.431
<v Speaker 2>who's become very anti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump believes we can find a way again,</v>

902
00:51:16.831 --> 00:51:21.480
<v Speaker 2>America as a way of finding a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

903
00:51:21.481 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm around to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

904
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:27.410
<v Speaker 2>but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

905
00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:32.160
<v Speaker 2>one in my early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can name every senator 10,</v>

906
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:33.180
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago,</v>

907
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.920
<v Speaker 2>every sound and go orrin hatch and Ted </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy were great friends,</v>

908
00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:42.921
<v Speaker 2>sponsored bills together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hatch did his eulogy that,</v>

909
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:47.400
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't exist today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today.</v>

910
00:51:47.401 --> 00:51:52.401
<v Speaker 2>The thing is so bad when Obama nominated</v>
<v Speaker 2>his guy for the Supreme Court and I </v>

911
00:51:53.281 --> 00:51:54.390
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't forget his name</v>

912
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 3>and they never brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now of course it's a mic.</v>

913
00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.040
<v Speaker 3>We'll get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get it.</v>

914
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:02.040
<v Speaker 2>But not when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

915
00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:02.600
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

916
00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 2>when we nominate people like that who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was pretty much middle of the road.</v>

917
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>garland.</v>

918
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Merrick garland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merrick garland.</v>

919
00:52:10.191 --> 00:52:15.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I would have Democrats now and they </v>

920
00:52:15.191 --> 00:52:18.941
<v Speaker 2>take the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hold up any appointment until </v>

921
00:52:18.941 --> 00:52:21.380
<v Speaker 2>they can have a precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a first person out of point would be</v>

922
00:52:21.381 --> 00:52:24.110
<v Speaker 2>married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called who deserved to be on that court.</v>

923
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is just both of them playing </v>

924
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.470
<v Speaker 3>politics to Dan.</v>

925
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.690
<v Speaker 2>We have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

926
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

927
00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:37.040
<v Speaker 2>when Merrick Garland was nominated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

928
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Orrin Hatch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he knew they would delay it,</v>

929
00:52:39.261 --> 00:52:44.261
<v Speaker 2>said he's a great man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it becomes party over country,</v>

930
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.550
<v Speaker 2>party over country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sad when you think it's going to change.</v>

931
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.200
<v Speaker 3>I think that the outrage machine that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're running on right now,</v>

932
00:52:57.201 --> 00:53:00.310
<v Speaker 3>I think it can only last for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think it couldn't.</v>

933
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.800
<v Speaker 3>It'll either blow up into something much</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse and I don't even know what I mean </v>

934
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.401
<v Speaker 3>by that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think things would actually get </v>

935
00:53:09.401 --> 00:53:11.231
<v Speaker 3>much worse and some of this would </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually spill over into violence or </v>

936
00:53:11.231 --> 00:53:14.951
<v Speaker 3>what my hope is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is more a realistic </v>

937
00:53:14.951 --> 00:53:19.511
<v Speaker 3>option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the outrage will start running </v>

938
00:53:19.511 --> 00:53:22.601
<v Speaker 3>out of steam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a car running out of gas and that </v>

939
00:53:22.601 --> 00:53:24.971
<v Speaker 3>from that somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether maybe if you're a clooney or </v>

940
00:53:24.971 --> 00:53:26.850
<v Speaker 3>whoever else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is just a decent human being,</v>

941
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:32.090
<v Speaker 3>a Bloomberg or something else will come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and decency will be appreciated </v>

942
00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think this outreach </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing can run forever.</v>

943
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:35.610
<v Speaker 3>It's too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too mentally exhausting.</v>

944
00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:36.780
<v Speaker 3>It's too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's physically</v>

945
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:39.890
<v Speaker 2>was a decent man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known for years with Joe Barton.</v>

946
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Nobody just like some wonderful father </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a third.</v>

947
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:48.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a great senator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great vice president.</v>

948
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.840
<v Speaker 2>If he were a little younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine he'd be,</v>

949
00:53:53.841 --> 00:53:54.910
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 two or something?</v>

950
00:53:54.911 --> 00:53:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she can't dislike them.</v>

951
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.490
<v Speaker 2>You want to be vp?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

952
00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't take the cut in pay.</v>

953
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:03.610
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

954
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.980
<v Speaker 3>let's finish up with some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some big picture,</v>

955
00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:09.040
<v Speaker 3>big picture stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking back,</v>

956
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.450
<v Speaker 3>is there anything you would've done </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently?</v>

957
00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.070
<v Speaker 3>We were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I got married</v>

958
00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:15.880
<v Speaker 2>as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have gone national sooner.</v>

959
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 2>I had the talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was a big fish in a smaller pond </v>

960
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:25.210
<v Speaker 2>in Miami and I liked that I'd radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

961
00:54:25.211 --> 00:54:27.610
<v Speaker 2>cop column in the Miami Herald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

962
00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:32.440
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew me in Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never sent a tape to New York.</v>

963
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have liked to gone national </v>

964
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.521
<v Speaker 2>sooner just just to have more success </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier you think is to appeal to more </v>

965
00:54:41.521 --> 00:54:42.400
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I had something.</v>

966
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I knew I was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I was good at what I did and I,</v>

967
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really get well known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my fifties and I think it couldn't </v>

968
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:57.071
<v Speaker 2>happen in the thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not any better than I was in the </v>

969
00:54:57.071 --> 00:55:00.510
<v Speaker 2>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not better today than I was when I </v>

970
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.580
<v Speaker 2>was in my late twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

971
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:05.960
<v Speaker 2>I was curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always let my ego at the door or was </v>

972
00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.470
<v Speaker 2>there short questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always got really interested in the </v>

973
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.470
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That never changed.</v>

974
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes someone will play me a tape </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had for 30 years ago.</v>

975
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Still me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still.</v>

976
00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.870
<v Speaker 2>They're still asking questions.</v>

977
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I think the first time I interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

978
00:55:21.661 --> 00:55:26.661
<v Speaker 3>I asked you something about the ego </v>
<v Speaker 3>component relative to to interviewing </v>

979
00:55:26.661 --> 00:55:27.750
<v Speaker 3>and your answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it and I.</v>

980
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I've really tried to incorporate it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I do,</v>

981
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 3>which is you said the show was called </v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry King tonight.</v>

982
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.470
<v Speaker 3>My ego was already stroke.</v>

983
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be there tomorrow.</v>

984
00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.320
<v Speaker 2>My model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good model of David.</v>

985
00:55:38.321 --> 00:55:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Could be your model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be anybody's model.</v>

986
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.920
<v Speaker 2>If Donald trump had this model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would be a better country.</v>

987
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:50.040
<v Speaker 2>This is my motto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never learned anything when I was </v>

988
00:55:50.771 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

989
00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I never learned anything when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

990
00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I may impart things to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may have some knowledge,</v>

991
00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.350
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't run into anything when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

992
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.800
<v Speaker 3>It feels like a privilege in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

993
00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:10.890
<v Speaker 3>When you have somebody great across from</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and you get this,</v>

994
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:12.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this hour of my life is a privilege.</v>

995
00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be on the Rubin report,</v>

996
00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:17.480
<v Speaker 2>to be part of what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

997
00:56:17.481 --> 00:56:20.690
<v Speaker 2>census or report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I get a grade?</v>

998
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.860
<v Speaker 3>Be graded at the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

999

<v Speaker 3>trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the youtube,</v>

1000
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:27.230
<v Speaker 1>youtube comments and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the where with all.</v>

1001
00:56:27.231 --> 00:56:32.231
<v Speaker 1>How do you see Larry King?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the last thing I want to impart </v>

1002
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:32.231
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1003
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 1>final question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

1004
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 1>What's it all about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've asked you this,</v>

1005
00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I've asked you some version of this many</v>
<v Speaker 1>times a day,</v>

1006
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it all about and what does it all</v>

1007
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:41.920
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

1008
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:46.500
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean a hundred years from </v>
<v Speaker 2>today?</v>

1009
00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Lowenstein once hit a grand slam </v>

1010
00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:58.671
<v Speaker 2>home run for the Orioles to beat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yankees and it was crowd went crazy.</v>

1011
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

1012
00:57:00.331 --> 00:57:01.830
<v Speaker 2>how does it feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1013
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:08.040
<v Speaker 2>100 million Chinese don't give a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it all mean?</v>

1014
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:11.970
<v Speaker 2>The answer is I don't know.</v>

1015

<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>

1020
