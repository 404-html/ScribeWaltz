00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a screenwriter,</v>

2
00:00:07.551 --> 00:00:08.384
<v Speaker 1>the host of the Andrew Klavan show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the few same people on the </v>

3
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Klavan.</v>

4
00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

5
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love your new studio.</v>

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.171
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:22.310
<v Speaker 1>you are one of the last guests before we</v>
<v Speaker 1>built this home studio,</v>

8
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.353
<v Speaker 1>and we had you on at a very odd time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was right before the </v>

9
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:26.324
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were going to air it after the </v>

10
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>election because I had to pad some shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were,</v>

11
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>we were building this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

12
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.883
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when on the assumption that Hillary was </v>

13
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:36.704
<v Speaker 1>gonna win and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people immediately after we </v>

14
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>heard it said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get Cleveland back on because</v>

15
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>you guys got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to clean this whole thing up.</v>

16
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>So you're ready to do some cleaning?</v>

17
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

18
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.493
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where I want to start first is I do </v>

19
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>consider you one of the few sane people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

20
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>that speaks ill of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I consistently,</v>

21
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>every time I watch one of your clips or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're tweeting about,</v>

22
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you strike me as just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically striked me as decent,</v>

23
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>which these days I think has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between decency,</v>

24
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of pressure I'm giving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.103
<v Speaker 1>is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is sad that being decent actually </v>

27
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>elevates you heard these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

28
00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

29
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing with me is that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say I can state with my principals</v>

30
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:22.004
<v Speaker 1>are I can I fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to follow my principals and I </v>

31
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>try not to get too mixed up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>

32
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>which in this day and age with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>president like trump,</v>

33
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>with like the people around you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around him makes things a lot clearer.</v>

34
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.173
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what people are paying </v>

35
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:36.224
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're paying attention to the big </v>

36
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paying attention to that.</v>

37
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.224
<v Speaker 1>He said this and she said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just like trying to follow that </v>

38
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.134
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would I know what it is and I'm trying </v>

39
00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>to follow that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>So I think I come from a similar place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you know,</v>

41
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>our politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which do line up in a lot of ways,</v>

42
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fully,</v>

43
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.463
<v Speaker 1>but that that's what I try to go for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think that comes from </v>

44
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>within you that you don't go for all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other stuff that,</v>

45
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.383
<v Speaker 1>that so many people do well in me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a matter of time or observing </v>

46
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>over time what works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what doesn't work.</v>

47
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just been a basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was the time I was raised in,</v>

49
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>but it has been a basic principle of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that peace of mind that people should be</v>

50
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

51
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>That you should be fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are,</v>

52
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made by God to be a free person.</v>

53
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>That the things that are happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside you that are expressed in your,</v>

54
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.123
<v Speaker 1>and the things that you like and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you want to say and your </v>

55
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:28.154
<v Speaker 1>opinions on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things are a uniquely </v>

56
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you're a jackass,</v>

57
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>even if you're saying stuff that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>me want to strangle you,</v>

58
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:36.524
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a racist or something like </v>

59
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:38.144
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's something uniquely </v>

60
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 1>valuable bull about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that it's more important than</v>

61
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.100
<v Speaker 1>some guy in Washington who knows better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>

62
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always been my assumption.</v>

63
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was raised in that all American way.</v>

64
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I was raised in the suburbs and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early sixties you know,</v>

65
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of what that was the civic</v>

66
00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>religion and it always good to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

67
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>when things changed I would listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arguments and I fall,</v>

68
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.674
<v Speaker 1>I've changed you.</v>

69
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I've developed and that things get are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different over time,</v>

70
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>but certain principles stay the same and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stick with that you basically,</v>

71
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.351
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:15.184
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a question of actually enjoying </v>

73
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>other people and even when they can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>jerks.</v>

74
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:21.754
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you can enjoy sitting across </v>
<v Speaker 1>from someone that you don't agree with </v>

76
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>you saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can do that.</v>

77
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you don't,</v>

78
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:29.644
<v Speaker 1>whenever I see on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says so and so destroys someone else </v>

79
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>says so and so talks to someone else and</v>
<v Speaker 1>big letters,</v>

80
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because yeah,</v>

81
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to people you disagree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

82
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>if they don't get angry at you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not shouting at you,</v>

83
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn a lot of stuff and he can and,</v>

84
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.193
<v Speaker 1>and you hone your own arguments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes on occasion you change your </v>

85
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

86
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

87
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I would say if I had to place myself on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political spectrum,</v>

88
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:53.824
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons I changed on </v>

89
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:57.364
<v Speaker 1>abortion took 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had an argument with a guy and I </v>

90
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>lost it and I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

91
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't defend my position against this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

92
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.723
<v Speaker 1>which is a great teachable moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real teachable moment that it </v>

93
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>reminds you to listen to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I like that you just used the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>civic religion because one of the things</v>

95
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about on here is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

96
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>leftism has become a secular religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

97
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I've had a couple of people mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of Peter,</v>

98
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>but goes in what's on a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

99
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really explained it well,</v>

100
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.643
<v Speaker 1>but that basically this has become this </v>
<v Speaker 1>infallible doctrine that you must never </v>

101
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.594
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do leave you're going to </v>

102
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>basically have a fat wallet on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

103
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a civic religion is,</v>

104
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>is an interesting phrase because </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically you were just,</v>

105
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>your civic religion in that regard was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just live and let live.</v>

106
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>But we're pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes basically.</v>

107
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that you know that the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>government there is,</v>

108
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>the less of a person there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>that the fact that a woman comes into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>town and says,</v>

110
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>oh I know how to do people's hair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government says we need a permit for</v>

111
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>that permit to do hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that that's,</v>

112
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just a kind of ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bald guy issue.</v>

113
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

114
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read those occasional stories where </v>

115
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>some little kid has a lemonade stand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police pull up,</v>

116
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he doesn't have a permit.</v>

117
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is the stuff that is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive to me and,</v>

118
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.763
<v Speaker 1>and it's like I guess over time I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept watching people who told me that </v>

119
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to make the world more </v>
<v Speaker 1>free and more fair,</v>

120
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>but it always turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not always,</v>

121
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:27.784
<v Speaker 1>but it often turned out that what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were really trying to do is take the </v>

122
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:31.294
<v Speaker 1>power away from someone they thought was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pressing them and take it themselves </v>

123
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>so that they could oppress a person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been oppressing.</v>

124
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>And I have like just steadfastly </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained that like I want the world to</v>

125
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.404
<v Speaker 1>be more free and more fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly willing to accept that </v>

126
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>somebody has been marginalized and needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be included,</v>

127
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.893
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not willing to force this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy to like it or to include them or do </v>

128
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.273
<v Speaker 1>serve him or do anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems to me that freedom is a </v>

129
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.050
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned something very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God now,</v>

131
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:59.160
<v Speaker 1>last time you were on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

132
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did sort of your whole evolution,</v>

133
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 1>which is really kind of fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were born Jewish,</v>

134
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>then you are atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For what a bulk of your five years.</v>

135
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>For 35 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GNOSTIC atheist.</v>

136
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And then about how old were you when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I was,</v>

137
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I was about 45 when I became an atheist </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I start to believe in God and I was</v>

138
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>just about 50 when I was baptized down.</v>

139
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>

140
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I just had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>your friend Dennis prager on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

142
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>my friend Dennis prager and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Michael Shermer,</v>

143
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you know Michael Michael who runs a </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptic magazine.</v>

144
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.463
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had a great conversation about </v>

145
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>belief and morality with God or without </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

146
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>It was really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end we all agreed,</v>

147
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.941
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how nice.</v>

148
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:38.774
<v Speaker 1>We can sit in a room and not agree on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and we might have dinner </v>

149
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:42.854
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

150
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for,</v>

151
00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>for you as someone that's traveled in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and out of religion,</v>

152
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how important is the idea of religion as</v>

153
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>a foundational belief for society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

154
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.403
<v Speaker 1>the only reason to believe in religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned is because it's </v>

155
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

156
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:01.364
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that it's good for society </v>

157
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:06.600
<v Speaker 1>or it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 1>or conducive to law and order are </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducive to politeness.</v>

159
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not interested in believing in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy just because it works.</v>

160
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've always hated arguments based on</v>

161
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 1>practicality when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics.</v>

162
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

163
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.853
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be a nice person and obviously </v>

164
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>without being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without being a theorist at all,</v>

165
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 1>plenty of Nice atheists are lovely </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are atheists.</v>

166
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.653
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that most of what you </v>

167
00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:35.140
<v Speaker 1>think is true is illogical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without religion,</v>

168
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.033
<v Speaker 1>without God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many people don't follow their own </v>

169
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:40.354
<v Speaker 1>thoughts down to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is true of both atheists and </v>

170
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.820
<v Speaker 1>believers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe that.</v>

171
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I think has happened to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

172
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right around the 17th century,</v>

173
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.253
<v Speaker 1>the science became science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We the of what we know it to be and </v>

174
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>certain questions were put aside in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do science.</v>

175
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.910
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had people saying,</v>

176
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.773
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can measure this and I can predict </v>

177
00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>this and then I can heal this and I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>build this and all these things are such</v>

178
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 1>obviously such a great benefit.</v>

180
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.050
<v Speaker 1>This is idea from the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the penicillin,</v>

181
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:14.884
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this stuff has revolutionized human </v>

182
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:18.274
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was assumed and it was argued that </v>

183
00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:21.904
<v Speaker 1>there was an underlying logic to science</v>
<v Speaker 1>which precluded God which eliminated </v>

184
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:27.034
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though most of the people who </v>

185
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:29.170
<v Speaker 1>invented science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're Christians,</v>

186
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.830
<v Speaker 1>there was presumed that there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying logic.</v>

187
00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:33.664
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say there's evolution and if </v>

188
00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:37.750
<v Speaker 1>there's evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is random and you go,</v>

189
00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:38.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

190
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:39.664
<v Speaker 1>there's evolution but random,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell randomness from within a </v>

191
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:44.224
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say I'm in a system and is </v>

192
00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:45.844
<v Speaker 1>random because obviously the order of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every system comes from outside the </v>

193
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:49.654
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that logic is starting to </v>

194
00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:52.654
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that logic has played out and </v>

195
00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I believe it has been to us in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialism that basically materialism,</v>

196
00:08:58.561 --> 00:08:59.394
<v Speaker 1>that everything is material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything has a material because the </v>

197
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>material explanation is better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

198
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.493
<v Speaker 1>That I believe is toxic because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make sense because you cannot </v>

199
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:09.894
<v Speaker 1>get from morality to materialism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>from materialism to morality that I </v>

200
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 1>believe has had a toxic effect on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

201
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.613
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't want to replace </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialism with theism because I think </v>

202
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.993
<v Speaker 1>it's toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it because I think the </v>

203
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 1>truth is healing and liberating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without going too far down,</v>

204
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>just specifically the rabbit hole of </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

205
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:33.084
<v Speaker 1>cause we've done it a bunch on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I find that even for </v>

206
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievers,</v>

207
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>everyone kind of gets to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

208
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.473
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I the good ones at least get to a </v>

209
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:41.611
<v Speaker 1>point where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

210
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>well that's what I believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it frames some other stuff.</v>

211
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:45.174
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without going too far down that </v>

212
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>rabbit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think that that those systems are</v>

213
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 1>collapsing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a,</v>

214
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:50.994
<v Speaker 1>is that really a metaphor or a or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridge to why so many systems seem like </v>

215
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:56.710
<v Speaker 1>they're collapsing right now?</v>

216
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Media politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's exactly what's happening.</v>

217
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.083
<v Speaker 1>I will sit here and predict to you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the next [inaudible] </v>

218
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.350
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's happening now,</v>

219
00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>but I believe it will erupt at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

220
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>That there's going to be an intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>revival of uh,</v>

221
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really Aristotelian thought.</v>

222
00:10:13.391 --> 00:10:14.224
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a purpose and that bottle has a </v>

223
00:10:16.451 --> 00:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this body has a purpose.</v>

224
00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:22.270
<v Speaker 1>This mine has a purpose that is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back.</v>

225
00:10:22.271 --> 00:10:23.104
<v Speaker 1>And when you talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting when you go in </v>

226
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.833
<v Speaker 1>to the top universities and you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the young people there who are the best </v>

227
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:31.630
<v Speaker 1>minds of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all believers.</v>

228
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wouldn't have been true I think 30</v>

229
00:10:35.561 --> 00:10:36.394
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is because ideas play </v>

230
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:42.340
<v Speaker 1>themselves out over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this idea that the world is material</v>

231
00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:42.850
<v Speaker 1>is ending.</v>

232
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.683
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the craziness we're </v>

233
00:10:45.491 --> 00:10:47.230
<v Speaker 1>seeing and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.183
<v Speaker 1>I hate talking about some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary political things because </v>

235
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.380
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like you're being mean.</v>

236
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Like it sounds like when I say if a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>has an operation then turns himself into</v>

237
00:10:59.411 --> 00:11:00.940
<v Speaker 1>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a woman.</v>

238
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a statement of fact in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my mind,</v>

239
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.773
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that he should be abused</v>
<v Speaker 1>or bullied or hurt or anything like </v>

240
00:11:06.821 --> 00:11:08.170
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different question.</v>

241
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.910
<v Speaker 1>But some of these questions where </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is starting to disappear I think</v>

242
00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:14.830
<v Speaker 1>are built into the fact that this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>is collapsing.</v>

243
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.370
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because I do believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trans people exist.</v>

244
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:19.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

245
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

246
00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you said that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist but,</v>

247
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 1>but that I believe that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a,</v>

248
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.080
<v Speaker 1>an actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

249
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.773
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an actual existential thing for </v>

250
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:31.514
<v Speaker 1>this particular person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet I can still go with you in that </v>

251
00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:35.654
<v Speaker 1>place because it seems like the hysteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>is constantly surrounding it is making </v>

252
00:11:38.871 --> 00:11:40.670
<v Speaker 1>people question everything.</v>

253
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.503
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you don't accept Trans people </v>

254
00:11:42.861 --> 00:11:44.920
<v Speaker 1>the second that everyone else except </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

255
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.940
<v Speaker 1>not even accept them because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people accept them.</v>

256
00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:49.160
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't celebrate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately or,</v>

257
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 1>or wish for a trans child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they,</v>

258
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>they will turn on as you're a transport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think some of the things that to,</v>

259
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.214
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a child a to hormone treatments or </v>

260
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:01.384
<v Speaker 1>any kind of opp operation based on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of state of preference and that I </v>

261
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:06.670
<v Speaker 1>believe is abusive that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I believe is wrong,</v>

262
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 1>but for an adult to decide that he wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live his life in any way he wants.</v>

263
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're not hurting anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means it means nothing to me.</v>

264
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just means nothing to me.</v>

265
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he says to me,</v>

266
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:17.614
<v Speaker 1>you must call me a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he is taken away my right to </v>

267
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:23.370
<v Speaker 1>experience reality as I experienced it.</v>

268
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's where he loses his rights as </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

269
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 1>this strikes me as you're sort of like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature Republican,</v>

270
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what it strikes me.</v>

271
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:32.764
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

272
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 1>because everything you just said makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense within a conservative viewpoint.</v>

273
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

274
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.820
<v Speaker 1>within a libertarian conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint,</v>

275
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 1>except there's so few conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to say that.</v>

276
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>What you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

277
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:44.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny you asked me at the very </v>

278
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.474
<v Speaker 1>beginning how I kept hold of some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these principles and it didn't occur to </v>

279
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:52.660
<v Speaker 1>me until just a moment ago is we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

280
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about one of the things is </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a novelist.</v>

281
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I've lived most of my life writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>novels.</v>

282
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And when you were a novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you create characters and</v>

283
00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 1>each one of these characters has a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete existence and a full,</v>

284
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:06.490
<v Speaker 1>complete justification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're inventing the bad guy,</v>

285
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you realize that in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world makes perfect sense and it,</v>

286
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 1>and he makes perfect sense in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

287
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.753
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think of people that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You maybe that's a novelist training or </v>

288
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe you start out with that and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns you into a novelist.</v>

289
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.630
<v Speaker 1>But I actually think of people that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think of somebody who says to</v>

290
00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:23.464
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having this inner experience of </v>

291
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:27.760
<v Speaker 1>being alienated from my sax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

292
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

293
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.191
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

294
00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't offend me.</v>

295
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

296
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.753
<v Speaker 1>that seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel it might be painful and it </v>

297
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:36.604
<v Speaker 1>offends me if he says that I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>react in a certain way or this guy has </v>

298
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>to react by law in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his experience is like,</v>

299
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:43.264
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is part of the kind of fabric </v>

300
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:45.880
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

301
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that there has been too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on both sides of conflated,</v>

302
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:55.870
<v Speaker 1>what government does with how we live.</v>

303
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.303
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had this argument with </v>

304
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:01.510
<v Speaker 1>conservatives a lot where they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>

305
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to legalize marijuana.</v>

306
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's fine.</v>

307
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Just don't let people drive with </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

308
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:07.444
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like what you want to poison </v>

309
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:09.850
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bad for you,</v>

310
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's none of my business.</v>

311
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think marijuana is bad?</v>

312
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I do think is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I've read,</v>

313
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it's bad for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't use it.</v>

314
00:14:15.611 --> 00:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really know that much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

315
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And you don't seem to want to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone from using cocoon.</v>

316
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Why would I want to stop somebody from </v>
<v Speaker 1>using it?</v>

317
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Except,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except if,</v>

318
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Speaker 1>if we were you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might say,</v>

319
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:24.851
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I've read some articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good for you,</v>

321
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.300
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

322
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.163
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming from me and you can say the </v>

323
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 1>vape pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not even room for the lungs.</v>

324
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the thing.</v>

325
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Government should not have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>approve or disapprove.</v>

326
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 1>It only has the right to protect me from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

327
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't protect me from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I want to throw myself off a bridge,</v>

328
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I think that's right?</v>

329
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I should be able to throw myself off</v>

330
00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:50.830
<v Speaker 1>a bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

331
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best example I was using,</v>

332
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 1>the seat seatbelts versus a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

333
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 1>when you use a cell phone in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're endangering me.</v>

334
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.800
<v Speaker 1>When you don't use your seatbelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to fly through the windshield.</v>

335
00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 1>It's none of my business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that I,</v>

336
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

337
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I knew that libertarians take some </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme crazy positions,</v>

338
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free markets,</v>

339
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>free minds seems to me that the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in Canada.</v>

340
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.563
<v Speaker 1>So I do see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freedom thing gaining traction for </v>

341
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the way that I've talked a lot,</v>

342
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:23.540
<v Speaker 1>obviously about classical liberalism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism in all of this,</v>

343
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I see that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it,</v>

344
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:27.650
<v Speaker 1>I just see it in society and on social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

345
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:28.484
<v Speaker 1>I see it more in a cooler fashion than </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be if it was maybe coming from </v>

346
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:34.094
<v Speaker 1>Ted Cruz or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I see it's gaining a little </v>

347
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 1>traction in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bigger way.</v>

348
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not all because of me,</v>

349
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

350
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.433
<v Speaker 1>well because of you.</v>

351
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.173
<v Speaker 1>But I liked what you said about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be an intellectual resurgens </v>

352
00:15:47.461 --> 00:15:50.240
<v Speaker 1>too because I am starting to see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of that,</v>

353
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.373
<v Speaker 1>that it's starting to feel cool to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge again as opposed to the 15 </v>

354
00:15:58.521 --> 00:15:59.354
<v Speaker 1>years of endless reality tv and just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst of us constantly and endless </v>

355
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:04.904
<v Speaker 1>bickering and one upping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're starting to turn a corner </v>

356
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:07.950
<v Speaker 1>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you,</v>

357
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.310
<v Speaker 1>which I've been waiting for for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

358
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 1>It's an awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I recently spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get to speak to often,</v>

360
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at places bark,</v>

361
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:19.190
<v Speaker 1>partly because like ignore the request </v>
<v Speaker 1>and out.</v>

362
00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Now I have somebody who does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I'll speak speaking,</v>

363
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.093
<v Speaker 1>I spoke at Oberlin recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a deeply like the heart of </v>

364
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:29.720
<v Speaker 1>liberal darkness and went in there and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

365
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I felt that these children who were my </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

366
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 1>they now look like children.</v>

367
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:34.663
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that they were being almost </v>

368
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.533
<v Speaker 1>abused by their heritage of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge of wisdom was being taken </v>

369
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 1>away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if,</v>

370
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should come out of college,</v>

371
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.230
<v Speaker 1>you should have read some shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

372
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.990
<v Speaker 1>and you should have read all of some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great writers.</v>

373
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:55.550
<v Speaker 1>You should know some of these great </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers,</v>

374
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:56.384
<v Speaker 1>Plato and people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you should know them without the </v>

375
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 1>professors standing between you and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

376
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare has traveled through time,</v>

377
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:06.590
<v Speaker 1>400 years to bring you the wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unique vision of the world.</v>

378
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't need a professor doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>but explaining the context to me,</v>

379
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:12.644
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have this thing called theory </v>

380
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 1>and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

381
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>it opened when there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a black dorm.</v>

382
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.583
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King would roll over in </v>

383
00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:20.670
<v Speaker 1>his grave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.210
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were kids who showed up,</v>

385
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 1>kind of aggressively displaying their </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual proclivities and then,</v>

387
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heckling me from the crowd.</v>

388
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I kept saying,</v>

389
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold your question and I'm going to,</v>

390
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to discuss everything you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss.</v>

391
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.820
<v Speaker 1>And then the minute I finished and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

392
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.010
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ran away,</v>

393
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:41.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

394
00:17:41.141 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are that something.</v>

395
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It's just right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

396
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.513
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what was interesting was a lot of </v>

397
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the liberal kids who are just ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

398
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 1>they state and we had really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>

399
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Only the hecklers ran away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

400
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>And so I just think these kids are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>deprived.</v>

401
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 1>They're being deprived of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual heritage.</v>

402
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.930
<v Speaker 1>They're being deprived of the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can't fix their problems.</v>

403
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 1>What they're being told is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy because,</v>

404
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be unhappy because of the way I </v>

405
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 1>treat them or you treat them or society </v>
<v Speaker 1>treats them.</v>

406
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 1>They're unhappy because of things inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

407
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:15.474
<v Speaker 1>And then there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gay guy yelling at me the whole </v>

408
00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at,</v>

409
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.343
<v Speaker 1>at one point I mentioned to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else in another context that I was </v>

410
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 1>actually a supporter of gay rights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he let out this loud,</v>

411
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:30.230
<v Speaker 1>we'll thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

412
00:18:30.231 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you think people don't like it</v>

413
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 1>because you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it cause you're allowed.</v>

414
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what a quality is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you just want people to be equal so</v>

415
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:43.440
<v Speaker 1>that you can treat them in a shitty is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you treat everybody else.</v>

416
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.274
<v Speaker 1>I don't want special treatment for being</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay and give me equal treatment and now </v>

417
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:50.430
<v Speaker 1>judge me according to exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this,</v>

418
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.140
<v Speaker 1>this is come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I see guys like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ton of Casey Coats and he writes these</v>

420
00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.210
<v Speaker 1>letters to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>

421
00:18:57.211 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you need to be made good for the sins of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

422
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>What a terrible thing to tell a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can solve the sins of the past.</v>

423
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's past,</v>

424
00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:08.334
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you cannot fix the things that were </v>

425
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 1>done to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot fix history.</v>

426
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 1>You can't pay people back for things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happen to people who are dead.</v>

427
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.370
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

428
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 1>that's the tragedy of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a fallen world.</v>

429
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

430
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 1>that things are written into the fabric </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

431
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.280
<v Speaker 1>And to tell somebody that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's not going to be happy until he</v>

432
00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 1>gets paid back for slavery or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

433
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.460
<v Speaker 1>It's condemning him to misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

434
00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:33.294
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sounding because it never </v>

435
00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:35.310
<v Speaker 1>stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The payback,</v>

436
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 1>the payback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

437
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.270
<v Speaker 1>There's never a moment where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

438
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.133
<v Speaker 1>well we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to where we're supposed to get </v>

439
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.940
<v Speaker 1>and now we don't need anything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

440
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by human logic,</v>

441
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:46.314
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this used to be the question of </v>

442
00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the good life?</v>

443
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.110
<v Speaker 1>What's conducive to happiness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

444
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes you miserable?</v>

445
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.270
<v Speaker 1>That used to be what you discussed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't.</v>

446
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:57.060
<v Speaker 1>The answer can't be my happiness depends</v>
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>

447
00:19:57.061 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Be Nice to me because you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are,</v>

448
00:19:59.551 --> 00:19:59.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

449
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>

450
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 1>what group invited you at Oberlin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The some,</v>

451
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 1>it was a bunch of Republicans who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the 15 republican's.</v>

452
00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:07.344
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of surprised they just wanted a </v>

453
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 1>16th guy to finally show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

454
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 1>they were like trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:14.364
<v Speaker 1>they were kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted me to come and make fun of </v>

456
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.100
<v Speaker 1>the left and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought they,</v>

457
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.720
<v Speaker 1>even though the whole thing wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly well,</v>

458
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I actually just talked about ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people listened and I thought,</v>

459
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a victory.</v>

460
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:26.844
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he felt that the conservatives are </v>

461
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.910
<v Speaker 1>so sick of being shouted at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've just turned into,</v>

462
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:34.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into trolls.</v>

463
00:20:34.091 --> 00:20:34.924
<v Speaker 1>They want to mock the other song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is kind of interesting </v>

464
00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:37.554
<v Speaker 1>because I say it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I only get invited now to colleges </v>

465
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.323
<v Speaker 1>by the young Republican's are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians and smarter students for </v>

466
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:45.930
<v Speaker 1>liberty or et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

467
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.940
<v Speaker 1>All of these things that are technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

468
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 1>even though they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem to mind that I'm gay,</v>

469
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:52.774
<v Speaker 1>married and pro choice and against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death penalty and a litany of other </v>

470
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's like,</v>

471
00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:57.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

472
00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Who is the tolerance side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get any invites from anyone.</v>

473
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.373
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no young Democrats or progressives up </v>

474
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever called me and been like,</v>

475
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:06.821
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

476
00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:09.070
<v Speaker 1>we actually see you criticizing her </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

477
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 1>but let's come and talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm getting a ton of love from those</v>

478
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 1>other guys who by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

479
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of trolls in that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

480
00:21:15.531 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 1>they've started being the funny people </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

481
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.500
<v Speaker 1>That's Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that for you as a,</v>

482
00:21:19.501 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 1>as a screenwriter and a guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounced between Hollywood and politics,</v>

483
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 1>is that fascinating to you though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is starting to become funny.</v>

484
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a joy.</v>

485
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>

486
00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:29.584
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my joke used to be that the reason </v>

487
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 1>conservatives aren't funny is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals have no sense of humor,</v>

488
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.453
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a joy to see conservatives </v>

489
00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:42.310
<v Speaker 1>becoming funny and becoming the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>of freedom.</v>

490
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.293
<v Speaker 1>Because let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism in the old style did have </v>

491
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 1>its oppressive elements and it did have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

492
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

493
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:50.314
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever people are in charge of the </v>

494
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as conservatives were until the 60s,</v>

495
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:54.700
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

496
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they abused that control.</v>

497
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:58.780
<v Speaker 1>That's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of power corrupting.</v>

498
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.003
<v Speaker 1>And there was that element in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there still is among conservatives </v>

499
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:05.410
<v Speaker 1>that somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.353
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are destroying the republic by not </v>

501
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 1>being exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bible beating Christian or whatever it</v>

503
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

504
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.430
<v Speaker 1>and that's just largely lifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is actually an effect,</v>

506
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:18.993
<v Speaker 1>I would say a positive effect that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties revolutionist haven't </v>

507
00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:23.730
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>

508
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:24.563
<v Speaker 1>This is day two of loosened up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to go back to wearing ties </v>

509
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:30.040
<v Speaker 1>to baseball games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to go back to,</v>

510
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

511
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rigid life where you can't be,</v>

512
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:33.671
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

513
00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take feminism.</v>

514
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.973
<v Speaker 1>Feminism right now to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like environmentalism is largely the </v>

515
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:39.940
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

516
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the feminists are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not about,</v>

517
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual sexual relations between people </v>

518
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 1>just like the environmentalist aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually about conservation and all this</v>

519
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:48.784
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to go back to a world </v>

520
00:22:49.811 --> 00:22:52.660
<v Speaker 1>where a woman doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't choose what life she wants.</v>

521
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say to people,</v>

522
00:22:54.221 --> 00:22:55.054
<v Speaker 1>if you draw a circle that's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>individualism and a circle of is called </v>

523
00:22:57.431 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 1>feminism in that place where the Venn </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram where they meet,</v>

524
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

525
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll agree with feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything outside of that I don't agree</v>

526
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:05.884
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to go back to a world </v>

527
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:11.110
<v Speaker 1>where a woman can't be fully whoever she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be and nobody wants a,</v>

528
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 1>certainly wants to go back to a racially</v>
<v Speaker 1>segregated world except the left.</v>

529
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They oddly are the ones that are pushing</v>

530
00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:17.944
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just described it overland and </v>

531
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:20.670
<v Speaker 1>so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

532
00:23:20.671 --> 00:23:21.504
<v Speaker 1>the modern right is to some degree a </v>
<v Speaker 1>function of certain things that left </v>

533
00:23:27.641 --> 00:23:32.641
<v Speaker 1>this have also brought to the table and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have now become the party of freedom.</v>

534
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 1>The party of hilarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

535
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:35.374
<v Speaker 1>I mean you do not laugh a lot when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were around leftist and when you </v>

536
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.210
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch Samantha B on,</v>

537
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not funny.</v>

538
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dead at that a trump.</v>

539
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to put it in the right and they </v>

540
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.850
<v Speaker 1>have to bleep it cause it's on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if the body man,</v>

541
00:23:51.851 --> 00:23:53.670
<v Speaker 1>anything to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would really exciting.</v>

542
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

543
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:57.950
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the funny thing about it is like</v>

544
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.943
<v Speaker 1>when you hear them doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the cursing and the anger and the </v>

545
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:03.130
<v Speaker 1>rage and a lot of laughs there.</v>

546
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.650
<v Speaker 1>So then when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

547
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 1>people on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like a jeff sessions,</v>

548
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:08.954
<v Speaker 1>cause there's a lot of talk that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go in and try to close medical </v>

549
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:11.804
<v Speaker 1>marijuana dispensaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you just made it very clear you </v>

550
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:14.714
<v Speaker 1>don't smoke marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you prefer everything being equal with </v>

551
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:18.074
<v Speaker 1>people didn't for health reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a lot of debate </v>

552
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:21.980
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just going with what you said.</v>

553
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.020
<v Speaker 1>When you see that as a small government </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and a state's rights guy and a,</v>

554
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:26.863
<v Speaker 1>and a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must be the part of the right that </v>

555
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

556
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know why you would bother </v>

557
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:32.871
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

558
00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why there should be medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana dispensaries.</v>

559
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Why shouldn't just be like a liquor </v>
<v Speaker 1>store?</v>

560
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.593
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't buy it if you're not 18 or </v>

561
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:40.484
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper ages and you can't use it </v>

562
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 1>behind the wheel of a car and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

563
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.250
<v Speaker 1>And then we get to tax tax it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

564
00:24:48.251 --> 00:24:49.310
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get all that money.</v>

565
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.583
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know why that should be </v>

566
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.010
<v Speaker 1>what's bothering him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

567
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked jeff sessions.</v>

568
00:24:56.991 --> 00:25:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pro jeff sessions guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to be a great age,</v>

569
00:25:00.111 --> 00:25:01.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to do.</v>

570
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>But are you concerned about that state </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

571
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Because to me that's one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

572
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.050
<v Speaker 1>The states' rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

573
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.320
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

574
00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:08.154
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joy about the trump era is all these </v>

575
00:25:10.971 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 1>liberal states suing the federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

576
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:14.264
<v Speaker 1>Because I think I win that either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either because the federal government </v>

577
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:20.340
<v Speaker 1>gets the conservative thing in there or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I win because they get states.</v>

578
00:25:20.341 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

579
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's why the whole that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've now been saying every week,</v>

580
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:24.134
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole chess board is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing up the traditional left right </v>

581
00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:27.440
<v Speaker 1>thing barely makes sense.</v>

582
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.890
<v Speaker 1>It's authoritarians and Libertarians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>allies,</v>

583
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming together in some interesting </v>

584
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:33.824
<v Speaker 1>spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I describe it as like being in a room </v>

585
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:36.044
<v Speaker 1>with a gravity has gone out of the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the furniture around and you </v>

586
00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:41.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where it's gonna land.</v>

587
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.923
<v Speaker 1>And I understand some of these guys like</v>
<v Speaker 1>national review and even my pal Ben </v>

588
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:45.891
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

589
00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I understand that they're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the furniture may fall.</v>

590
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.413
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of optimistic and I'm not sure </v>

591
00:25:52.641 --> 00:25:55.670
<v Speaker 1>how much of that is constitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of the does observational,</v>

592
00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:56.504
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

593
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 1>But I do feel that good things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

594
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I look to the generations down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

595
00:26:03.181 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 1>what I see coming up is kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural liberalism,</v>

596
00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.130
<v Speaker 1>which I agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

597
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 1>but an understanding that freedom is </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic and freedom is governmental.</v>

598
00:26:14.361 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 1>And if the government can tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like and what to do,</v>

599
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

600
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

601
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you're not free and they're not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

602
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you a rare choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

603
00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:24.044
<v Speaker 1>Do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we want to go media first or trump </v>

604
00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 1>first from here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a choose your own adventure.</v>

605
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.070
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the same thing.</v>

606
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

607
00:26:32.211 --> 00:26:34.850
<v Speaker 1>let's go trump first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I hear you talk about trump,</v>

608
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:36.970
<v Speaker 1>so I was with you on election night </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

609
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:39.200
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were at the daily wire offices and it</v>

610
00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:40.180
<v Speaker 1>was me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and,</v>

611
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:43.190
<v Speaker 1>and Shapiro and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who else do I build?</v>

612
00:26:43.191 --> 00:26:44.024
<v Speaker 1>Widow was there and he was a funny night</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were all having very mixed </v>

613
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:49.230
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I voted for Gary Johnson.</v>

614
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really want either one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

615
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 1>when ben was alternately like thrilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>and depressed because,</v>

616
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't vote for trump.</v>

617
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't vote for trump.</v>

618
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Has he publicly said who we voted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

619
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

620
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually comes from,</v>

621
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did vote for trump.</v>

622
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:04.734
<v Speaker 1>I didn't vote for trump at the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute and I made this very public </v>

623
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.810
<v Speaker 1>decision and I explained my reasons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

624
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

625
00:27:10.401 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>and then the fourth guy that was with </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

626
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Bill Whittle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a huge trump supporter.</v>

627
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:15.144
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about now that this whole </v>

628
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 1>thing has been flipped in that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

629
00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:19.044
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

630
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So since the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I watched your videos,</v>

631
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:21.924
<v Speaker 1>you strike me as one of the only people </v>
<v Speaker 1>making any sense on trump because you </v>

632
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:24.924
<v Speaker 1>don't strike me as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a pure fan boy and think that he can </v>

633
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:29.670
<v Speaker 1>go out into fifth avenue and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

634
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:33.660
<v Speaker 1>You might turn on him for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also don't strike me as,</v>

635
00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:36.090
<v Speaker 1>as just what is what most people are at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment,</v>

636
00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:38.160
<v Speaker 1>which is just this hysterical lunacy.</v>

637
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hilarious.</v>

638
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:41.543
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write columns a lot of times a PJ </v>

639
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:47.280
<v Speaker 1>media and I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

640
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:51.770
<v Speaker 1>trump has done this right and this wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get this vicious attacks.</v>

641
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.853
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an antique trumper and they'll </v>

642
00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:58.600
<v Speaker 1>let you know you're a cock cock cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I go to work and uh,</v>

643
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:02.170
<v Speaker 1>everybody there who was kind of anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump yells at me for selling myself.</v>

644
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:03.703
<v Speaker 1>So I get it from all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always think we're selling </v>

645
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:07.660
<v Speaker 1>ourselves though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that seem odd to you?</v>

646
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Will people think if they disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

647
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.460
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their reasons irrational,</v>

648
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.320
<v Speaker 1>your reasons or personal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they think,</v>

649
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.183
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always doing it for money or for </v>

650
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:16.554
<v Speaker 1>some other reward somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do it just sure it's pure </v>

651
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:22.290
<v Speaker 1>intellect that has gotten them to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing,</v>

652
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:23.800
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have that intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

653
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.653
<v Speaker 1>And so it is funny too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause a lot of the guys I work with are </v>

654
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:28.370
<v Speaker 1>younger than me and I always look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them think,</v>

655
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 1>do you think maybe it's occurred to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to examine my own motos yeah.</v>

656
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Well that that concept though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we dive fully into trump,</v>

657
00:28:36.061 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 1>that concept of impugning your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual opponents motives.</v>

658
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's such a sad thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeped into everything and slash or,</v>

659
00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:45.810
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some people obviously who</v>

660
00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:48.180
<v Speaker 1>were so corrupt that it's obvious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

661
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 1>but people are trying to find their way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people in you know,</v>

662
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:52.780
<v Speaker 1>in the middle are trying to find their </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

663
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.440
<v Speaker 1>So trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

664
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.640
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so make some sense out of trump.</v>

665
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:57.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the people that voted for </v>

666
00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 1>trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I genuinely thought that Hillary</v>

667
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Clinton was a threat to the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

668
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not over I that I usually don't talk</v>

669
00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:07.734
<v Speaker 1>in those big terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she did not believe in free speech </v>

670
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:10.704
<v Speaker 1>or hatred of the citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>United ruling was just indicated to me </v>

671
00:29:14.731 --> 00:29:16.920
<v Speaker 1>that she believed the speech should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled.</v>

672
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:17.963
<v Speaker 1>There are four justices on the supreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>court who have signed onto a theory of </v>

673
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:23.394
<v Speaker 1>the first amendment that says </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially that it does not guarantee </v>

674
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:27.084
<v Speaker 1>you the right to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it guarantees is that the </v>

675
00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 1>government should control speech so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>our values continue to be upheld.</v>

676
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick,</v>

677
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.410
<v Speaker 1>stupid and wrong theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more judge,</v>

678
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe all of them would sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>on everything,</v>

679
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.293
<v Speaker 1>but one more judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that obviously there was an open </v>

680
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:47.620
<v Speaker 1>seat and we could have lost the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment.</v>

681
00:29:47.621 --> 00:29:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that was the most likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

682
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:50.044
<v Speaker 1>but it could have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you take the counterpoint on </v>

683
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:53.710
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just for devil's advocate,</v>

684
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:55.450
<v Speaker 1>the people that would argue against you </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

685
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.200
<v Speaker 1>on citizens united?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

686
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.031
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

687
00:29:58.031 --> 00:30:00.430
<v Speaker 1>citizens united just says that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>form a corporation,</v>

688
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 1>if you and I form the Reuben clave </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

689
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 1>we don't lose our right to free speech.</v>

690
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.283
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was citizens united put </v>

691
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:09.310
<v Speaker 1>out a documentary against Hillary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

692
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:12.160
<v Speaker 1>well that's campaigning so you can't put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on the air.</v>

693
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's free speech.</v>

694
00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.530
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

695
00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:15.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a corporation so you don't have </v>

696
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:17.350
<v Speaker 1>the rights in the New York Times signed </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto that.</v>

697
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.610
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

698
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 1>we are a corporation has free speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were oppressed corporation.</v>

699
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.370
<v Speaker 1>But your corporation does not have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

700
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.353
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's typical of the left because as I </v>

701
00:30:28.031 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe their,</v>

702
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 1>their reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their logic is collapsing.</v>

703
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.680
<v Speaker 1>So they have to shout you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can invite they've Ruben to Oberlin</v>

704
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:36.071
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:37.750
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk with the left.</v>

706
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 1>They can't because they know their </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument is over.</v>

707
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.193
<v Speaker 1>So I voted for trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5% of my mind and in my mind 5% I was </v>

708
00:30:45.521 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 1>thinking the guy's Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:48.363
<v Speaker 1>there's a 5% chance I am making the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest mistake of my life and I'm </v>

710
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:52.720
<v Speaker 1>pretty high percentage.</v>

711
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.850
<v Speaker 1>If you're going Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your apps.</v>

712
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:55.743
<v Speaker 1>When when Reagan was elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember having friends called me up </v>

713
00:30:58.121 --> 00:30:59.020
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the end?</v>

714
00:30:59.021 --> 00:30:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

715
00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

716
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:02.820
<v Speaker 1>it will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be on the other side for a while.</v>

717
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:03.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

718
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.350
<v Speaker 1>you will die when people call me up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

719
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:10.351
<v Speaker 1>I was going like 95% and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.430
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

721
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:16.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a big percentage if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking a genuine authoritarian tire.</v>

722
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.693
<v Speaker 1>I just thought the bet was worth it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I thought that Hillary was the </v>

723
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:25.240
<v Speaker 1>end of the American experiment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece fullest possible way.</v>

724
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.103
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

725
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.943
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something in sports called </v>

726
00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:28.564
<v Speaker 1>losing comfortably where you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice you're losing and then the game </v>

727
00:31:30.701 --> 00:31:33.760
<v Speaker 1>is over and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought she was.</v>

728
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.653
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I thought that it was worth the </v>

729
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:40.621
<v Speaker 1>risk and I have been largely delighted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with how good he's been.</v>

730
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.433
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean I think he's been </v>

731
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:46.803
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means that I was really worried </v>

732
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.570
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to be really bad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead he's been pretty good,</v>

733
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

734
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 1>crazy things about him that are hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get over the mean tweets,</v>

735
00:31:58.391 --> 00:31:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the personal tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:00.730
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't mind that.</v>

737
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind the mean tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

738
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:03.783
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you like three things that he </v>

739
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 1>has done that have really lifted me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

740
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Like I really just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

741
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Gorsuch,</v>

742
00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:16.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the obvious one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a big deal.</v>

743
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.670
<v Speaker 1>And and people who on the right who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like trump keeps saying,</v>

744
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.420
<v Speaker 1>oh you keep bringing up gorsuch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep bringing it up,</v>

745
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:24.730
<v Speaker 1>but until I'm gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's a big,</v>

746
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 1>big supreme court appointment and he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great job.</v>

747
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.113
<v Speaker 1>It's also kind of a funny one to </v>
<v Speaker 1>diminish regardless of what side you're </v>

748
00:32:30.231 --> 00:32:31.064
<v Speaker 1>on because guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the supreme courts are a third of the </v>

749
00:32:33.731 --> 00:32:34.564
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

750
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.433
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the brands you left has </v>

751
00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 1>been using them as a super legislature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it won't do that.</v>

752
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 1>He said opposed to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one,</v>

753
00:32:42.081 --> 00:32:44.060
<v Speaker 1>and this is a little wonky of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been,</v>

754
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about a way before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

755
00:32:45.981 --> 00:32:46.814
<v Speaker 1>so I feel I come by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it naturally is he's been rolling back </v>

756
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:51.350
<v Speaker 1>regulations and we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this before,</v>

757
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:52.184
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you need a permit to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your to be a hairstylist permit to sell </v>

758
00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 1>lemonade on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

759
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.170
<v Speaker 1>he's been rolling that back and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a deal,</v>

760
00:33:00.171 --> 00:33:02.810
<v Speaker 1>luge that was Obama's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parthian shot as he was leaving office.</v>

762
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 1>He just left all these regulations in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and he's been repealing them.</v>

763
00:33:09.831 --> 00:33:14.831
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that is a huge deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The regulatory state is a genuine threat</v>

764
00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:16.970
<v Speaker 1>to our freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

765
00:33:16.971 --> 00:33:17.804
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to ask permission of the </v>

766
00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 1>government to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

767
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:22.940
<v Speaker 1>is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's to me,</v>

768
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is a really,</v>

769
00:33:25.131 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 1>is uplifting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third thing,</v>

770
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I wanted to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump first,</v>

771
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 1>is that he has driven a truck into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of a corrupt,</v>

772
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.830
<v Speaker 1>biased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually poisonous media.</v>

773
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.620
<v Speaker 1>And it was rotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The structure was rotten.</v>

774
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 1>But he's the one who drove the truck </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

775
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think anybody else had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>charisma or the viciousness or,</v>

776
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the UN or that understanding that </v>

777
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:52.130
<v Speaker 1>comes from being a TV star to do what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has done.</v>

778
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.230
<v Speaker 1>So I'm with Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Especially on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the regulations also.</v>

780
00:33:56.761 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is somewhere where I have shifted a</v>

781
00:33:58.401 --> 00:33:58.971
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

782
00:33:58.971 --> 00:33:59.804
<v Speaker 1>I get it now the government regulations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these nonsensical things and you </v>

783
00:34:03.191 --> 00:34:04.280
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a small business owner,</v>

784
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I so understand those types of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

785
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that last one to me is the one </v>

786
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:11.540
<v Speaker 1>that's really resonating with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the way you just said it.</v>

787
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.383
<v Speaker 1>And that's the one that is catching fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people and that's the one that I </v>

788
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:19.610
<v Speaker 1>think really most people just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just intuitively they understand.</v>

789
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he truly truly got it right</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning?</v>

790
00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that really all came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>him?</v>

791
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the part,</v>

792
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said before the action,</v>

793
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know what his moral center </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

794
00:34:30.051 --> 00:34:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I still don't know what like his real </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the ethos of this man is.</v>

795
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really understood that?</v>

796
00:34:37.571 --> 00:34:38.404
<v Speaker 1>Like that was just from being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsider and mocked at the old White </v>

797
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.103
<v Speaker 1>House press correspondence things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being on reality TV in New York media </v>

798
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.450
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got it because he's,</v>

799
00:34:47.451 --> 00:34:49.460
<v Speaker 1>then he's one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

800
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:51.710
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean me too.</v>

801
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:52.544
<v Speaker 1>I was a reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in radio news and all this stuff </v>

802
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:57.620
<v Speaker 1>and I would see what was going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how people thought and how,</v>

803
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.470
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who agree with you,</v>

804
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:02.390
<v Speaker 1>you become biased on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just,</v>

805
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a talent for it.</v>

806
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.470
<v Speaker 1>He's got a talent for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

807
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I used to talk to Andrew Breitbart and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would sit there and go like,</v>

808
00:35:09.561 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands the flow of information that</v>

809
00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:14.054
<v Speaker 1>is going to be here at this moment at 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>o'clock and it's to be here at two </v>

810
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:17.410
<v Speaker 1>o'clock and it's going to hear three </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

811
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.070
<v Speaker 1>This is the way it's gonna work trumps </v>
<v Speaker 1>not like that.</v>

812
00:35:19.071 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 1>He has a natural genius for </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the flow of information.</v>

813
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.343
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he will do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll send out a tweet and everybody </v>

814
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:28.550
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did he distract everybody from,</v>

815
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.543
<v Speaker 1>and he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He realized that he was losing control </v>

816
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:34.250
<v Speaker 1>of the narrative and you seized it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And does he do that?</v>

817
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Like sit up in his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mount a white and say,</v>

818
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it 10,</v>

819
00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.183
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

820
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I kind of doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him,</v>

821
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:45.900
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think he has a natural feeling for</v>

822
00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 1>the way this works and he understands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

823
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 1>he'd be a fool not to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's under fire unfairly.</v>

824
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

825
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.970
<v Speaker 1>and I think he knows how to fight back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a pleasure to watch.</v>

826
00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.933
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so trump drives a truck through this </v>

827
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

828
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.283
<v Speaker 1>I like what has happened there and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get to that and seeing that in </v>

829
00:36:03.481 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 1>a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's talk about that 5%.</v>

830
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you still fear that 5% or have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears been allayed just because time has</v>

831
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:14.600
<v Speaker 1>gone on and you haven't seen anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that observed,</v>

832
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.230
<v Speaker 1>they have been a lead to almost almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely everything that I thought about</v>

833
00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:20.064
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out to be true in terms of my </v>

834
00:36:22.501 --> 00:36:23.334
<v Speaker 1>assessment of his personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of it turned out to be its </v>

835
00:36:25.321 --> 00:36:27.830
<v Speaker 1>worst manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

836
00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.420
<v Speaker 1>it really did bother me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

837
00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:34.060
<v Speaker 1>that he would use violent language at </v>
<v Speaker 1>rallies a punch.</v>

838
00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:34.894
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see that Guy Punch him in the </v>

839
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Speaker 1>face and all that stuff and he does have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that side to his personality,</v>

840
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.460
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't manifest itself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in actual violence or act.</v>

841
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the opposite of an authoritarian.</v>

842
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.703
<v Speaker 1>If you consider the fact that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most incompetent parts of his imagined </v>

843
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:55.850
<v Speaker 1>of his administration is he has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>unable to fill a lot of the positions in</v>

844
00:36:57.501 --> 00:36:58.231
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the government,</v>

845
00:36:58.231 --> 00:36:59.064
<v Speaker 1>in the permanent government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't taken over the permanent </v>

846
00:37:00.601 --> 00:37:01.434
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what in the thor and actual </v>

847
00:37:02.251 --> 00:37:03.084
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know an actual Hitlerian figure </v>

848
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.173
<v Speaker 1>would come in and make sure he made all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the appointments and put his guys in </v>

849
00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:08.814
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's too lazy to do that because that </v>

850
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:11.750
<v Speaker 1>lazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is that just a function of heat?</v>

851
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:12.623
<v Speaker 1>Cause there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason to believe he's just having </v>

852
00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:16.980
<v Speaker 1>trouble getting the right type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>

853
00:37:16.981 --> 00:37:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that he probably is having </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble with is he,</v>

854
00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has this unfortunate habit.</v>

855
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 1>One of his really unfortunate habits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong footing his own people.</v>

856
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So you'll go out and you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

857
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:31.740
<v Speaker 1>president trump said this and he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>

858
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And you get stabbed in the back by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own guy.</v>

859
00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of people don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sign on for that.</v>

860
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.270
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's erratic and he is emotional.</v>

861
00:37:39.271 --> 00:37:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's dangerous for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

862
00:37:41.491 --> 00:37:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best people that said,</v>

863
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.063
<v Speaker 1>he has appointed a tremendous cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean unbelievable cabinet and the </v>

864
00:37:47.461 --> 00:37:48.294
<v Speaker 1>cabinet of people who are at odds with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the agencies that they are appointed to </v>

865
00:37:51.511 --> 00:37:53.520
<v Speaker 1>lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is part of my hatred of,</v>

866
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation agency and regulation.</v>

867
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Speaker 1>So when you see things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so something like that,</v>

868
00:37:58.770 --> 00:37:59.603
<v Speaker 1>the Paris climate accords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that you are fine with us </v>

869
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:03.630
<v Speaker 1>getting thrilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's nonsense.</v>

870
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Nonsense in that it was nonbinding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that we had to burden the</v>

871
00:38:09.361 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 1>load or I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

872
00:38:10.351 --> 00:38:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I think the Paris accords were only </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get us into legal trouble.</v>

873
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 1>There were only there so people could </v>
<v Speaker 1>sue us.</v>

874
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:15.803
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing binding about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it would give a lot of legal </v>

875
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:18.624
<v Speaker 1>problems to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also believe that global warming </v>

876
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:22.740
<v Speaker 1>as it's posed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

877
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:23.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that the world isn't </v>

878
00:38:23.941 --> 00:38:24.774
<v Speaker 1>getting warmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that global warming </v>

879
00:38:26.191 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 1>isn't hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Environmental disaster.</v>

880
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.143
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

881
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive it's a nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

882
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.140
<v Speaker 1>where do you go for information on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on global warming?</v>

883
00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:35.974
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is one of the ones where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>find that when I'm talking to </v>

884
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:39.244
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and where I know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much ground to agree on some </v>

885
00:38:42.881 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I do believe in climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change I would do,</v>

886
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:46.924
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even have to call it global </v>

887
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climate Change.</v>

888
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.653
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the very fact they changed it to </v>

889
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:53.820
<v Speaker 1>climate change from global warming tells</v>
<v Speaker 1>her this argument.</v>

890
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

891
00:38:55.781 --> 00:38:59.200
<v Speaker 1>we're on a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spiraling into an atomic explosion.</v>

892
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not a steady state is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a secure environment.</v>

893
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:05.020
<v Speaker 1>We're not living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've gone from ice ages to,</v>

894
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:05.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a love of the world being basically </v>

895
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:09.281
<v Speaker 1>molten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

896
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:10.960
<v Speaker 1>as I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the climate changes.</v>

897
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.093
<v Speaker 1>So we know the climate is changing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know it's gotten more and more over </v>

898
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:15.274
<v Speaker 1>the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

899
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going back in time.</v>

900
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:19.130
<v Speaker 1>There were years when the Thames froze </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

901
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:19.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people skated on the Thames and so </v>

902
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 1>like we know that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's changes.</v>

903
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.820
<v Speaker 1>There is no way to a know how much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is human endeavor and,</v>

904
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.120
<v Speaker 1>and be to know how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this goes into the future.</v>

905
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.103
<v Speaker 1>When people say science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no science for predicting the </v>

906
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:38.344
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no science for predicting the </v>

907
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:40.210
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

908
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 1>When people are telling you what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen in the future,</v>

909
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Speaker 1>they are what's coming out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth is nothing.</v>

910
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:46.743
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people say this is what's going to </v>

911
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:48.874
<v Speaker 1>happen 10 years down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have arguments like this about </v>

912
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:51.970
<v Speaker 1>politics too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody says,</v>

913
00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:54.680
<v Speaker 1>well if we do this then in four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go like ass,</v>

914
00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:57.430
<v Speaker 1>stop sovereign right there I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you until Thursday.</v>

915
00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.400
<v Speaker 1>And then you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

916
00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I love that because every time they</v>

917
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:01.984
<v Speaker 1>show anything that worked well the CBO </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that in 10 years this is going to </v>

918
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 1>cost 20 million lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>

919
00:40:05.621 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 1>has that ever happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always doing this.</v>

920
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:08.853
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the same people who got </v>

921
00:40:09.581 --> 00:40:13.830
<v Speaker 1>everything wrong before the election and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you suddenly can prognosticate.</v>

922
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you hear the phrase,</v>

923
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.473
<v Speaker 1>if present trends continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything after that is </v>

924
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 1>nonsense because that never happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

925
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

926
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.870
<v Speaker 1>so without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without getting too far into the climate</v>

927
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:23.704
<v Speaker 1>change thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's some role for </v>

928
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:25.564
<v Speaker 1>government to play with dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other nations when it comes to climate </v>

929
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 1>and that I can't think of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

930
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:33.580
<v Speaker 1>except like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.473
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe in preserving our </v>

932
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:37.150
<v Speaker 1>environment and taking care of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

933
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.063
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing is the left always </v>

934
00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:39.754
<v Speaker 1>takes these rational issues where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a true good to be gained and </v>

935
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:46.420
<v Speaker 1>they turned them into hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So give us all your power.</v>

936
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

937
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.213
<v Speaker 1>I'm a religious guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a guy comes on TV and says Jesus is </v>

938
00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 1>coming tomorrow unless you send me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>

939
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I get suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

940
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.533
<v Speaker 1>But so when these guys say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't give the government all </v>

941
00:40:57.131 --> 00:41:00.550
<v Speaker 1>power and essentially fulfill every </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist need,</v>

942
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 1>the world is going to be destroyed in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hail of fire.</v>

943
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like yeah,</v>

944
00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll turn on something else and see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an old Yogi Berra rerun on her,</v>

945
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.820
<v Speaker 1>which there usually you go up into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>really high channel.</v>

946
00:41:11.821 --> 00:41:13.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like around one 30 or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

947
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.980
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the media.</v>

948
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause cause you can talk about,</v>

949
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.830
<v Speaker 1>we can talk ourselves into a trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

950
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.673
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fidget spinner and not going to get us </v>

951
00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

952
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.370
<v Speaker 1>the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he drove this truck through it.</v>

953
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I do think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's helped voices like yours,</v>

954
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:28.474
<v Speaker 1>like what we're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like many other people who are not </v>

955
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:34.870
<v Speaker 1>promising all the answers but at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>promising discussions and,</v>

956
00:41:34.871 --> 00:41:37.340
<v Speaker 1>and some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some lines of thought that maybe weren't</v>

957
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:38.174
<v Speaker 1>getting out there in the mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there is a risk in </v>

958
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:41.234
<v Speaker 1>that too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we are just going to filter </v>

959
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:44.174
<v Speaker 1>ourselves into oblivion to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where instead of having three news </v>

960
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:49.334
<v Speaker 1>channels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're now going to have a good Gillian </v>

961
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:53.240
<v Speaker 1>of them and we're all going to hate each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other for a zillion new and reasons that</v>

962
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 1>we didn't even realize that.</v>

963
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Definitely there's a definite moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>hazard here.</v>

964
00:41:56.451 --> 00:41:57.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean a free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

965
00:41:57.171 --> 00:41:58.004
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

966
00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:58.933
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as these liars and our press keeps </v>

967
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 1>saying a free press is important to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>free society.</v>

968
00:42:03.261 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And you do want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

969
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 1>another thing that's working well under </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump is that everybody,</v>

970
00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 1>that the pressers attacking the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in power instead of what they did during</v>

971
00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 1>the Obama administration where they kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands over their eyes and said,</v>

972
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's scandal free.</v>

973
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.023
<v Speaker 1>I would argue there's a little bit of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcorrection happened and </v>

974
00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:21.530
<v Speaker 1>overcorrection no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's because they're so corrupt.</v>

975
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:22.364
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

976
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So I do believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

977
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.540
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

978
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.863
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a press that basically stands up to </v>

979
00:42:29.361 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe in a free press.</v>

980
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.113
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a free press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a press that has been corrupted </v>

981
00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:35.330
<v Speaker 1>beyond its purposes.</v>

982
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean they're no good </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporters.</v>

983
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:39.343
<v Speaker 1>That means that a good reporter on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times is basically doing the </v>

984
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:46.690
<v Speaker 1>wrong thing because he's giving credence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

985
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.290
<v Speaker 1>he's given credence and credibility to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophomore,</v>

986
00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Eric Left Wing College magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with his,</v>

987
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:56.870
<v Speaker 1>can you give an example of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the type of thing.</v>

988
00:42:56.871 --> 00:42:57.704
<v Speaker 1>So I attack CNN all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some bad stuff lately out of </v>

989
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times where the headline </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads you one way and then when you read</v>

990
00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:05.450
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really isn't what it said.</v>

991
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:07.580
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing a lot of corrections </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately,</v>

992
00:43:07.581 --> 00:43:09.960
<v Speaker 1>which usually no one reads the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correction.</v>

993
00:43:09.961 --> 00:43:11.630
<v Speaker 1>So you never see any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I,</v>

994
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 1>when I do attack the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would give me more shit.</v>

995
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Like CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone's in on the joke now,</v>

996
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 1>but New York Times it's a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

997
00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So when you describe it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a sophomore,</v>

998
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:21.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

999
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you read their op Ed page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I now call knucklehead row,</v>

1000
00:43:26.181 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read their op ed page,</v>

1001
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:32.080
<v Speaker 1>really is like a bunch of eight year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls in a room where a mouse has gotten</v>

1002
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>

1003
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And so they're all screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling,</v>

1004
00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:35.500
<v Speaker 1>everybody running around in hysterics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1005
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.580
<v Speaker 1>and that's really unfair to eight year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old girls.</v>

1006
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1007
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:40.634
<v Speaker 1>just yesterday they ran a story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump jr met with a Russian </v>

1008
00:43:43.281 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 1>lawyer and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

1009
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

1010
00:43:46.011 --> 00:43:46.844
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump jr met with a Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer to get info because he thought </v>

1011
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 1>she had information on the opposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody,</v>

1012
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faints and who cares?</v>

1013
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I saw celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well known people think this is it.</v>

1014
00:43:57.921 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the collusion we've been looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1015
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called story.</v>

1016
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:03.140
<v Speaker 1>It's called opposition research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone does this.</v>

1017
00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Hillary didn't meet with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to see if they had information on</v>

1018
00:44:05.961 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 1>trump and only in an organization where </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one is sitting next to you who says,</v>

1019
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a story.</v>

1020
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:13.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a 30 page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 story.</v>

1021
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Only in a place where everybody thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've found the smoking gun.</v>

1022
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Can you make a fool of yourself like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1023
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.871
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1024
00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:23.510
<v Speaker 1>you want somebody to say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1025
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a conservative,</v>

1026
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.833
<v Speaker 1>but there is some thing to not letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people starve to death in the streets </v>

1027
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:30.490
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1028
00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.540
<v Speaker 1>from out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You okay then the opposite is true,</v>

1029
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:33.961
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:44:33.961 --> 00:44:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I know you were a left winger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody does oppo research and you</v>

1031
00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.293
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that she was from Russia and </v>

1032
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 1>makes it doesn't mean a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1033
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>

1034
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:44.390
<v Speaker 1>he didn't buy anything from you or take </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything from her.</v>

1035
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.250
<v Speaker 1>It was a ruse to get them to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this ruling.</v>

1036
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:48.084
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that limits the way they can use banks </v>

1037
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:50.394
<v Speaker 1>and all this stuff.</v>

1038
00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:51.243
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1039
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 1>we'd been listening to this stupid story</v>
<v Speaker 1>for six months,</v>

1040
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 1>this Russian story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not a story.</v>

1041
00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not,</v>

1042
00:44:58.321 --> 00:44:59.154
<v Speaker 1>and even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the Russian meddling with the </v>

1043
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe happened,</v>

1044
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.420
<v Speaker 1>is kind of like finding a spy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1045
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 1>we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness,</v>

1046
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:10.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a spy who would ever spy on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>call,</v>

1047
00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1048
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we bring our spies back for a couple</v>

1049
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:14.030
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 1>that that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1051
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:17.070
<v Speaker 1>we do it to them and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do it to us.</v>

1052
00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.230
<v Speaker 1>So the New York Times has become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dishonest and it,</v>

1053
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.660
<v Speaker 1>they use good reporters in good </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting to tell a dishonest story.</v>

1054
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.793
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that they think that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>even can conceive of the idea that </v>

1055
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:32.550
<v Speaker 1>they're not a leftist rag shows you how </v>
<v Speaker 1>far gone they are.</v>

1056
00:45:32.551 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they cannot,</v>

1057
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1058
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it any day,</v>

1059
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:37.613
<v Speaker 1>pick up the Wall Street Journal and pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the New York Times and the Wall </v>

1060
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Street Journal.</v>

1061
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times,</v>

1062
00:45:42.271 --> 00:45:43.550
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1063
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that you made a point </v>
<v Speaker 1>of saying the op Ed page,</v>

1064
00:45:46.101 --> 00:45:46.934
<v Speaker 1>it's too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously you expect opinion </v>

1065
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.690
<v Speaker 1>that's separate than the editorial side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1066
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:51.543
<v Speaker 1>but their app aid page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reaction to some of the things that </v>

1067
00:45:53.401 --> 00:45:54.234
<v Speaker 1>they're doing has gotten insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they brought Bret Stevens from the </v>

1068
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.383
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He writes that one piece basically just </v>

1069
00:45:58.411 --> 00:45:59.244
<v Speaker 1>about skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't even really say he doesn't </v>

1070
00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:01.680
<v Speaker 1>believe in climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1071
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I think you may have even said the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>

1072
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.313
<v Speaker 1>But then there were immediately people </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding he be fired and all of this </v>

1073
00:46:08.101 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 1>craziness just for having an alternate </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion on their op Ed page.</v>

1074
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.570
<v Speaker 1>But the one that I thought was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

1075
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:14.160
<v Speaker 1>do you see the one a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1076
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about uh,</v>

1077
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein from evergreen state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all about campus free speech.</v>

1078
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.603
<v Speaker 1>But basically the thrust of it at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end was we as liberal as better there </v>

1079
00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 1>are caring about this because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming for us.</v>

1080
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1081
00:46:26.671 --> 00:46:27.504
<v Speaker 1>what an odd admission you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are now admitting that you didn't </v>

1082
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:31.794
<v Speaker 1>care about free speech because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming about coming against the other </v>

1083
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.693
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's finally turning on a guy </v>

1084
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:37.200
<v Speaker 1>who's left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

1085
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super progressive.</v>

1086
00:46:38.281 --> 00:46:41.490
<v Speaker 1>So now we better start caring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was strange.</v>

1087
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Admitted it was a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was refreshing.</v>

1088
00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:43.773
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I think the New York Times </v>

1089
00:46:45.091 --> 00:46:48.100
<v Speaker 1>was just gone so far down this hole that</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1090
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.370
<v Speaker 1>an article like that stands out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1091
00:46:50.371 --> 00:46:52.200
<v Speaker 1>when you read an article like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Times you go like,</v>

1092
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:54.330
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the New York Times there now for</v>

1093
00:46:54.331 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 1>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1094
00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

1095
00:46:56.761 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the New York Times should be for</v>

1096
00:46:58.171 --> 00:46:59.700
<v Speaker 1>free speech every day for everyone.</v>

1097
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.533
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times should have </v>

1098
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:02.453
<v Speaker 1>conservatives on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the desks where the news decisions </v>

1099
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:07.470
<v Speaker 1>are being made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1100
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal is,</v>

1101
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:13.050
<v Speaker 1>is anti trump and its news pages </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes unfairly,</v>

1102
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not crazily.</v>

1103
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:15.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have people obviously correcting </v>

1104
00:47:16.951 --> 00:47:19.040
<v Speaker 1>their opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1105
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:23.220
<v Speaker 1>that comes a level that comes a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the level of corruption gets so bad</v>

1106
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:24.533
<v Speaker 1>that audacity becomes a kind of a brag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this in governments all the </v>

1107
00:47:28.231 --> 00:47:29.470
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it in Illinois,</v>

1108
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 1>places like Chicago and things like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>where remember the,</v>

1109
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1110
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.710
<v Speaker 1>boss tweed and the little tin box and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff,</v>

1111
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.260
<v Speaker 1>put the money in a little tin box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This corruption is,</v>

1112
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:42.094
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this comes from a sense that we are so </v>

1113
00:47:43.571 --> 00:47:45.730
<v Speaker 1>corrupt that no one can touch us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1114
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.983
<v Speaker 1>When you put George Stephanopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Clinton hack at the top of your news </v>

1115
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:52.510
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is your news guy.</v>

1116
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a sign that you have become </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>

1117
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he's at ABC news that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ABC,</v>

1118
00:47:57.461 --> 00:47:59.590
<v Speaker 1>has not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that he's not a nice man or whatever</v>

1119
00:47:59.591 --> 00:48:01.240
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who once said to Hillary,</v>

1120
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:02.223
<v Speaker 1>I love you hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can have a role in your news </v>

1121
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:05.164
<v Speaker 1>department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he should not be running in your </v>

1122
00:48:06.041 --> 00:48:08.090
<v Speaker 1>news department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy at CBS.</v>

1123
00:48:08.091 --> 00:48:08.924
<v Speaker 1>So who just looks like Ted Baxter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember from the buyer isn't Scott </v>

1124
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:14.973
<v Speaker 1>Pelley who may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who made decisions so bias during the </v>

1125
00:48:18.281 --> 00:48:19.114
<v Speaker 1>Obama administration that his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporters didn't want their stories </v>

1126
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:24.670
<v Speaker 1>going on his air because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do what I was talking about with</v>

1127
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:25.504
<v Speaker 1>serve a biased report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This corruption has becomes so manifest </v>

1128
00:48:30.311 --> 00:48:35.311
<v Speaker 1>and so absurd that to see it taken down </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a beautiful thing.</v>

1129
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:36.813
<v Speaker 1>But you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to replace it with something of </v>

1130
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

1131
00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 1>We need to replace it with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>

1132
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So is that why they're hitting back so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard?</v>

1133
00:48:42.821 --> 00:48:46.750
<v Speaker 1>So the CNN thing that happened last week</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this threat to docs,</v>

1134
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.570
<v Speaker 1>this person who did an perfectly legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1135
00:48:49.571 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it is legal to make means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1136
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:53.800
<v Speaker 1>he didn't make it for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1137
00:48:53.801 --> 00:48:54.634
<v Speaker 1>it got to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sounds like it was actually a </v>

1138
00:48:55.721 --> 00:48:56.760
<v Speaker 1>slightly altered version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1139
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.753
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are millions of people making </v>

1140
00:48:59.201 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 1>means on the Internet as we sit here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1141
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:02.374
<v Speaker 1>The second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just that they were </v>

1142
00:49:04.031 --> 00:49:06.100
<v Speaker 1>threatening to dox this guy for doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something illegal.</v>

1143
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:08.320
<v Speaker 1>It was the line after that where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1144
00:49:08.321 --> 00:49:11.550
<v Speaker 1>he's agreed not to do this offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1145
00:49:11.551 --> 00:49:11.801
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

1146
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:12.634
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if they're the church or his parents </v>

1147
00:49:14.381 --> 00:49:15.340
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

1148
00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:17.320
<v Speaker 1>to me that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the scarier thing,</v>

1149
00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 1>not the threat of the docs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course is wrong,</v>

1150
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.820
<v Speaker 1>but the threat that they were tacitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying or implicitly saying to everybody</v>

1151
00:49:24.821 --> 00:49:25.930
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1152
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.390
<v Speaker 1>we're watching you two and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to come for all of them.</v>

1153
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1154
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.630
<v Speaker 1>the Internet turned on them in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful fashion,</v>

1155
00:49:31.631 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1156
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.033
<v Speaker 1>but it was only the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the followup and the completion of the </v>

1157
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:37.444
<v Speaker 1>logic that went after joe the plumber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the right mishandled that </v>

1158
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:41.434
<v Speaker 1>by elevating joe the plumber to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of commentator because he'd been </v>

1159
00:49:43.751 --> 00:49:45.010
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember Joe,</v>

1160
00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:48.490
<v Speaker 1>the plumber went out and asked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question of a political candidate and he</v>

1161
00:49:48.491 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 1>went after the Chi West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question,</v>

1162
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what the,</v>

1163
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:56.080
<v Speaker 1>how corrupt they've become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are thuggish and this is all of</v>

1164
00:49:56.081 --> 00:49:56.411
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1165
00:49:56.411 --> 00:49:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the networks.</v>

1166
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.833
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about Wapo and I'm talking </v>

1167
00:50:00.311 --> 00:50:01.144
<v Speaker 1>about CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in some ways the least of them </v>

1168
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.670
<v Speaker 1>because it's just a small operation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would vanish like that.</v>

1169
00:50:06.671 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 1>If people cut their cable cords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1170
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1171
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.120
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that thing?</v>

1172
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.310
<v Speaker 1>They say that if they would get cnn at </v>
<v Speaker 1>airports,</v>

1173
00:50:12.311 --> 00:50:14.290
<v Speaker 1>it would lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would lose all of his,</v>

1174
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:16.460
<v Speaker 1>all of his viewers do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1175
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.360
<v Speaker 1>it's all of these guys and and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate,</v>

1176
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't even occurred to one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not one of them has said,</v>

1177
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1178
00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 1>trump is being a jerk and trump is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fair what he does.</v>

1179
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.853
<v Speaker 1>It's really wrong when he attacks our </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporter in terms of her face or </v>

1180
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:31.041
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has a point,</v>

1182
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to reform our industry.</v>

1183
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:39.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason that the people believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump more than they believe us.</v>

1184
00:50:39.091 --> 00:50:41.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason that people hate us so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

1185
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.250
<v Speaker 1>So it really is that they've just been </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk on power.</v>

1186
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These last,</v>

1187
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>

1188
00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:46.274
<v Speaker 1>they'd been drunk on power for so long </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they finally have someone </v>

1189
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 1>throwing it in their face.</v>

1190
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:50.743
<v Speaker 1>And now the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual people that are rising up </v>

1191
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:55.460
<v Speaker 1>against them to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw,</v>

1192
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw probably Chris Cuomo,</v>

1193
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.950
<v Speaker 1>who of course his brother is the mayor </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the governor,</v>

1194
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.793
<v Speaker 1>he's a yard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said his father was the governor of </v>

1195
00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:04.400
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an idiot.</v>

1196
00:51:04.401 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 1>He's like Fredo from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really,</v>

1197
00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1198
00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.120
<v Speaker 1>every time you see the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just another,</v>

1199
00:51:11.121 --> 00:51:11.954
<v Speaker 1>just embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he tweeted something about these </v>

1200
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.373
<v Speaker 1>hateful means and should we release the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information because the guys tweeted </v>

1201
00:51:19.251 --> 00:51:21.590
<v Speaker 1>some other races and stuff and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he ended up deleting it.</v>

1202
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.240
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I retweeted him and I said,</v>

1203
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:24.074
<v Speaker 1>would you say that a meme or a Gif is </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than what then Linda Sarsour </v>

1204
00:51:30.081 --> 00:51:31.670
<v Speaker 1>calling for a jihad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1205
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:33.180
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it briefly before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

1206
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 1>but regardless of whether she meant her </v>
<v Speaker 1>own personal jihad,</v>

1207
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:36.554
<v Speaker 1>but she's talking about the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>supremacists and Islamophobia in the </v>

1208
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:39.560
<v Speaker 1>White House.</v>

1209
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And everyone knows if you're using that </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

1210
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to gin up a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1211
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.090
<v Speaker 1>And My tweak got way more retweets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything then than any of his due.</v>

1212
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:50.000
<v Speaker 1>He has a million followers and almost no</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>

1213
00:51:50.001 --> 00:51:51.890
<v Speaker 1>which also tells you a little something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1214
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:53.143
<v Speaker 1>but I bring this up because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course he doesn't respond because </v>

1215
00:51:55.611 --> 00:51:58.460
<v Speaker 1>they think they're beholden to nobody to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like we're,</v>

1216
00:51:58.461 --> 00:52:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but we actually are beholden to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

1217
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.453
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a newspaper man was a </v>

1218
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:03.374
<v Speaker 1>newspaper man in a small town with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful and somewhat corrupt </v>

1219
00:52:06.141 --> 00:52:07.910
<v Speaker 1>sheriff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like out of a movie,</v>

1220
00:52:07.911 --> 00:52:08.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would do,</v>

1221
00:52:08.571 --> 00:52:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I would batch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember saying to one,</v>

1222
00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I had some sources in the department and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember saying to one of them,</v>

1223
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:14.953
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we work for,</v>

1224
00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:16.220
<v Speaker 1>we both worked for the people.</v>

1225
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:17.263
<v Speaker 1>And he turned around and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with are the people you work for </v>

1226
00:52:18.531 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 1>a corporation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1227
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:20.893
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>

1228
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.630
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1229
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.280
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand that.</v>

1230
00:52:25.281 --> 00:52:27.110
<v Speaker 1>They're just mouthpieces for big </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>

1231
00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:30.380
<v Speaker 1>which love big government because big </v>
<v Speaker 1>government hurts the little guy,</v>

1232
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they're doing.</v>

1233
00:52:32.001 --> 00:52:35.420
<v Speaker 1>They're just standing up for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful corporations in the name of all</v>

1234
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:36.700
<v Speaker 1>the leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1235
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by words and all this stuff.</v>

1236
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:40.303
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really have lost any real sense of </v>

1237
00:52:43.191 --> 00:52:44.870
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

1238
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pitiful to watch in some ways,</v>

1239
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.390
<v Speaker 1>but it is good to see it getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed.</v>

1240
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:52.430
<v Speaker 1>And what I would like to see on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1241
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I feel on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of really good people like</v>

1242
00:52:56.301 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 1>you and me and Ben and all these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing opinions.</v>

1243
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:00.403
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't consider myself part of the </v>

1244
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 1>right kind of moving into libertarian.</v>

1245
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1246
00:53:05.091 --> 00:53:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still a liberal,</v>

1247
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 1>which is a fine line between that and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian.</v>

1248
00:53:09.261 --> 00:53:10.094
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1249
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:11.203
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to even pause you there to say </v>

1250
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:13.424
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know a certain amount of people </v>

1251
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:15.770
<v Speaker 1>start screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I considered my,</v>

1252
00:53:15.771 --> 00:53:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm more than happy to talk to all you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

1253
00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.410
<v Speaker 1>but I say it all the time that I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative because I'm alone.</v>

1254
00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll just give it varies on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1255
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1256
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that I would like to see us </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to gather information and,</v>

1257
00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:29.943
<v Speaker 1>and that's expensive and you need people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to back you when you needed to somehow </v>

1258
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:33.954
<v Speaker 1>make it profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we need to start sending people to </v>

1259
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:38.610
<v Speaker 1>the hotspots because for me to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

1260
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.623
<v Speaker 1>I have to go to the New York Times and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal and CNN and all </v>

1261
00:53:42.121 --> 00:53:47.121
<v Speaker 1>these places cause they hire reporters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's opinions are great and insights</v>

1262
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:51.360
<v Speaker 1>are great and there is now because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>press is so corrupt,</v>

1263
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 1>there is an actual need for people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>us to say,</v>

1264
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:58.950
<v Speaker 1>they're telling you the facts mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the facts actually might mean this,</v>

1265
00:53:58.951 --> 00:53:59.784
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an actual profession now as a </v>

1266
00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:03.390
<v Speaker 1>real profession that needs to be done.</v>

1267
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:04.583
<v Speaker 1>But I would like to see the right go </v>
<v Speaker 1>after have people in Iraq have people </v>

1268
00:54:09.301 --> 00:54:10.081
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1269
00:54:10.081 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hotspots of the world,</v>

1270
00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:12.294
<v Speaker 1>have people in Washington DC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best news program on television as </v>

1271
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Brett bears special report because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>gather news and because they're fair,</v>

1272
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 1>even though he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1273
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 1>even though they tilt to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very fair about what they cover.</v>

1274
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:26.123
<v Speaker 1>Are you shocked by the breadth of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sort of the amount of activists </v>

1275
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:33.690
<v Speaker 1>masquerading as journalists because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think they are truly,</v>

1276
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:35.040
<v Speaker 1>these people are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1277
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I've seen just some of the recent hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces on me.</v>

1278
00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1279
00:54:38.131 --> 00:54:38.964
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much I plead my case or </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend myself or show them evidence to </v>

1280
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 1>the contrary of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1281
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:43.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some mother Jones calling me and </v>

1282
00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:46.350
<v Speaker 1>extremist to the right of Breitbart.</v>

1283
00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real doozy.</v>

1284
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1285
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:52.500
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't correct anything.</v>

1286
00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:53.334
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know their job is safe and it's </v>

1287
00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:57.150
<v Speaker 1>like forgetting all that you are not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist.</v>

1288
00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.353
<v Speaker 1>That's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted the guys something to that </v>

1289
00:54:59.341 --> 00:54:59.671
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1290
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a journalist,</v>

1291
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1292
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.050
<v Speaker 1>What you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I probably had a decent case</v>

1293
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:04.651
<v Speaker 1>for liable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1294
00:55:04.651 --> 00:55:07.170
<v Speaker 1>What you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you admit what you're doing?</v>

1295
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:12.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's like that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lack of self awareness.</v>

1296
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:12.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1297
00:55:12.991 --> 00:55:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have now been saying this to the right</v>

1298
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.910
<v Speaker 1>for 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years about our loss of the culture.</v>

1299
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.073
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the result of our loss of the </v>

1300
00:55:24.271 --> 00:55:27.810
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our loss of TV stations.</v>

1301
00:55:27.811 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1302
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.950
<v Speaker 1>women's magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every woman's magazine is left wing.</v>

1303
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Every comedian on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every late night comedian,</v>

1304
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 1>every single one is a left winger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one,</v>

1305
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.393
<v Speaker 1>not one woman.</v>

1306
00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:39.243
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when one of them made a joke was </v>

1307
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>nice to Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was basically pilloried,</v>

1308
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:45.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to take Jimmy Fallon,</v>

1309
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Fallon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the one.</v>

1310
00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:47.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1311
00:55:47.101 --> 00:55:48.820
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell the difference because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all the same,</v>

1312
00:55:48.821 --> 00:55:49.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>

1313
00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:51.720
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we,</v>

1314
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.180
<v Speaker 1>how did we let that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then why don't we respond?</v>

1315
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:55.223
<v Speaker 1>And I always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say to conservatives that </v>

1316
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.553
<v Speaker 1>telling them about the culture is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to explain to my wife when she </v>

1317
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:02.910
<v Speaker 1>buys something on sale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still costs money.</v>

1318
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Had you always looks at me and he goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

1319
00:56:05.431 --> 00:56:06.264
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a cute guy and I like you but I </v>

1320
00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:09.600
<v Speaker 1>don't know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way conservatives look at</v>

1321
00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:10.160
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1322
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:10.993
<v Speaker 1>like how did we get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have people talking like a 100 year </v>

1323
00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:18.690
<v Speaker 1>old men go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to the movies anymore.</v>

1324
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:19.523
<v Speaker 1>I just turn on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn our clouddam Doris stays good </v>

1325
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:22.020
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1326
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

1327
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:24.814
<v Speaker 1>And how do we get to the point where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>start making stuff that educates people </v>

1328
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.090
<v Speaker 1>not to be right wingers but simply to </v>
<v Speaker 1>open their minds a little bit.</v>

1329
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.070
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what your feelings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Milo,</v>

1330
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:36.904
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect that after hearing you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you must at least love much of the </v>

1331
00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:41.464
<v Speaker 1>movement behind him because he isn't he </v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't that thing that you're now </v>

1332
00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 1>saying we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were winning the culture war back.</v>

1333
00:56:47.441 --> 00:56:48.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked about that all the time right </v>

1334
00:56:49.481 --> 00:56:50.314
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1335
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:52.770
<v Speaker 1>that is such a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1336
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a great question because Milo gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>me fits.</v>

1337
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only spoken to Milo once.</v>

1338
00:56:57.521 --> 00:56:59.950
<v Speaker 1>We had a long conversation about video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

1339
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:02.770
<v Speaker 1>He was when he was on Gamergate and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1340
00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 1>and I liked the men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1341
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.313
<v Speaker 1>I got along with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has done some stuff that's so </v>

1342
00:57:07.481 --> 00:57:09.580
<v Speaker 1>vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly to my friend Ben Shapiro,</v>

1343
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:11.940
<v Speaker 1>which I resent because he's my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1344
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:15.400
<v Speaker 1>an antisemitic and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's given,</v>

1345
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:19.650
<v Speaker 1>given shelter to Antisemites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I always feel the minute,</v>

1346
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 1>dice minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see antisemitism.</v>

1347
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:22.870
<v Speaker 1>It is the canary in the coal mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1348
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 1>that's where like evil dwells basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually go for the,</v>

1349
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:27.320
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for the Jews first and like,</v>

1350
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:33.120
<v Speaker 1>so there's stuff that he's done that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just think it's great and I wish that he</v>

1351
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:35.600
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1352
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find himself in a somewhat better place </v>

1353
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:41.830
<v Speaker 1>because there is such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I believe everyone should be</v>

1354
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:43.650
<v Speaker 1>allowed to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some things that are,</v>

1355
00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.740
<v Speaker 1>that when spoken or reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1356
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:47.501
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1357
00:57:47.501 --> 00:57:49.150
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's consequences for your speech.</v>

1358
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:49.841
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1359
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:52.330
<v Speaker 1>and when I hear him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1360
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the June remarks and the,</v>

1361
00:57:55.511 --> 00:57:57.100
<v Speaker 1>and the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1362
00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of hateful,</v>

1363
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:04.630
<v Speaker 1>allowing hatefulness to be cute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing it to be ironic saying,</v>

1364
00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:05.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him say,</v>

1365
00:58:05.771 --> 00:58:07.890
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him say when,</v>

1366
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:11.650
<v Speaker 1>when our generation is antisemitic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just being ironical.</v>

1367
00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1368
00:58:12.551 --> 00:58:14.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a snake that's going to bite </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1369
00:58:14.171 --> 00:58:14.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1370
00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buy into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1371
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:17.543
<v Speaker 1>and so I like what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't always like the way that he's </v>

1372
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:23.440
<v Speaker 1>doing it or what he's doing it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>service to.</v>

1373
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 1>But certainly when he had what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the dangerous faggot tour,</v>

1374
00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:28.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I laughed out loud.</v>

1375
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I thought I wanted more of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1376
00:58:30.581 --> 00:58:31.301
<v Speaker 1>that was bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bright.</v>

1377
00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Bart and I used to have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation all the time.</v>

1378
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first met Breitbart,</v>

1379
00:58:35.711 --> 00:58:39.220
<v Speaker 1>he kind of enlisted me into the La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right as he did.</v>

1380
00:58:39.221 --> 00:58:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1381
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to him,</v>

1382
00:58:41.831 --> 00:58:42.664
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you right upfront that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going in for this gay stuff </v>

1383
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:47.830
<v Speaker 1>because of this anti gay stuff cause I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think we're going to lose.</v>

1384
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:48.341
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1385
00:58:48.341 --> 00:58:49.174
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has no shame but we're going to </v>

1386
00:58:50.471 --> 00:58:52.300
<v Speaker 1>lose and be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a shame.</v>

1387
00:58:52.301 --> 00:58:54.400
<v Speaker 1>That's really shameful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breitbart said to me,</v>

1388
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 1>what I want is more patriotic gay porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1389
00:58:58.540 --> 00:58:59.373
<v Speaker 1>sign me up.</v>

1390
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:02.103
<v Speaker 1>Two straight guys demanding more </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriotic that how much of the country </v>

1391
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:08.380
<v Speaker 1>we're going to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1392
00:59:08.381 --> 00:59:09.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that,</v>

1393
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.841
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1394
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I have this conversation with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Milo all the time.</v>

1395
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I see a good that he is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see dangers in the way he's doing it.</v>

1396
00:59:19.601 --> 00:59:24.050
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can be too about too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much because there is moral universe and</v>

1397
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.600
<v Speaker 1>you do not want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want to blow yourself through</v>

1398
00:59:26.601 --> 00:59:28.180
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's kind of the fast and</v>

1399
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 1>bargain that you have to play?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting what you want,</v>

1400
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.050
<v Speaker 1>what you've wanted here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you as a guy that's been through the</v>

1401
00:59:33.051 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood machine too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

1402
00:59:35.091 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Speaker 1>you're getting the culture wins that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1403
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:38.810
<v Speaker 1>if he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say he had done,</v>

1404
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:39.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a little more careful with his </v>

1405
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:42.284
<v Speaker 1>language or not done some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary over the top stuff or </v>

1406
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever that it might have.</v>

1407
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've shaved some of the good part</v>

1408
00:59:50.361 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 1>that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1409
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:52.154
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe just wouldn't have broke through </v>

1410
00:59:52.801 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 1>with his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what the trump,</v>

1411
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.350
<v Speaker 1>the trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ian bargain.</v>

1412
00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.273
<v Speaker 1>I was only a guy as uncaring about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>niceties would have driven his truck </v>

1413
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.010
<v Speaker 1>into the media the way he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

1414
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 1>does it come with moral hazards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1415
01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:09.914
<v Speaker 1>To people have to speak up about those </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral hazards and take the flack from </v>

1416
01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>the right when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1417
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 1>oh you're a cock and you're all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1418
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:16.363
<v Speaker 1>Yes we have to take that flag but it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be done because I think we had </v>

1419
01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:21.044
<v Speaker 1>reached a tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use a cliched phrase like </v>

1420
01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:24.614
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we had reached a tipping </v>

1421
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>point where we were sounding very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a communist country.</v>

1422
01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:30.674
<v Speaker 1>Like there was things that you could say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that made you persona non grata that </v>

1423
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>there were opinions.</v>

1424
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>You can have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1425
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the trap door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the James Bond villain drop through</v>

1426
01:00:40.251 --> 01:00:42.860
<v Speaker 1>the trap door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we were in a dangerous point.</v>

1427
01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>And if we end political correctness is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>smothering toxic,</v>

1428
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:47.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil device for making the lines seemed </v>

1429
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:52.694
<v Speaker 1>like a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if Donald Trump destroys political </v>

1430
01:00:55.371 --> 01:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will have done a great thing.</v>

1431
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great thing.</v>

1432
01:00:59.060 --> 01:00:59.893
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has moral hazards come along with </v>

1433
01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we shouldn't forget it.</v>

1434
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:04.943
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example of this was when they </v>

1435
01:01:05.601 --> 01:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>shut down Shakespeare on the park the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>

1436
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Now Shakespeare that was reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to assassinate the president or onstage.</v>

1437
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I really think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1438
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:14.390
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Shakespeare Fan,</v>

1439
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an awful,</v>

1440
01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:17.534
<v Speaker 1>awful thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they would have done the same thing </v>

1441
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>if it was Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1442
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to shut them down and to have my </v>

1443
01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1444
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>writing that this was a good thing.</v>

1445
01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:29.683
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree because now what </v>

1446
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to fight to say,</v>

1447
01:01:35.061 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>well we've got to be as tough as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

1448
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:37.783
<v Speaker 1>but to say we've got to be as tough as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left for things that the left would </v>

1449
01:01:39.951 --> 01:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>approve of like shutting down free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

1450
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:44.750
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why he both,</v>

1451
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's why again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sides,</v>

1452
01:01:46.371 --> 01:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>the sides are just becoming meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nonsense science.</v>

1453
01:01:50.901 --> 01:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation because I do think that I,</v>

1454
01:01:54.551 --> 01:01:55.384
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1455
01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:56.243
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the problem I have with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right right now is I keep saying to </v>

1456
01:01:58.881 --> 01:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1457
01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:00.373
<v Speaker 1>you're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're disturbed because the </v>

1458
01:02:01.821 --> 01:02:02.654
<v Speaker 1>conservative movement has essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed when trump swept all those </v>

1459
01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>guys off the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he did and the primaries,</v>

1460
01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 1>the conservative movement was done for.</v>

1461
01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>And my response to that is fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1462
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>put it back together differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1463
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a new world,</v>

1464
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.983
<v Speaker 1>make a new conservative conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get rid of your </v>

1465
01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:21.234
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get rid of your big </v>

1466
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might have to get rid of some of</v>

1467
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>the ways those principles express </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the world.</v>

1468
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that just,</v>

1469
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>that's just real politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1470
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be here,</v>

1471
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>you're just viewing the world as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as you want it to be.</v>

1472
01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a guy like,</v>

1473
01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:35.064
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bill kristol where it's like he </v>

1474
01:02:36.631 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>wants that conservative thing to exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1475
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can make that happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you certainly can't.</v>

1476
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:44.483
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go through several other </v>
<v Speaker 1>iterations before it was ever to get </v>

1477
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>back to something like that.</v>

1478
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:48.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1479
01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in guys like Henry Olsen </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are basically saying,</v>

1480
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>pointing out that Reagan was kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fdr Democrat more than anything else and</v>

1481
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:59.820
<v Speaker 1>he invented the kind of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism I,</v>

1482
01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in guys who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1483
01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:04.800
<v Speaker 1>this is the field of play and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we want to get.</v>

1484
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.000
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1485
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.820
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing that I know that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice a lot of commentators don't.</v>

1486
01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I know where I want to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get to more freedom.</v>

1487
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I have more freedom now six months after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the election of Donald Trump,</v>

1488
01:03:14.331 --> 01:03:15.164
<v Speaker 1>seven months after the election of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump than I did eight months </v>

1489
01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:18.300
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>

1490
01:03:18.301 --> 01:03:19.134
<v Speaker 1>In my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the EPA can't now rule my </v>

1491
01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:22.404
<v Speaker 1>sink a waterway and declare that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can now tell me whether I can shave or </v>

1492
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:26.670
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1493
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that that makes me more free.</v>

1494
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:29.550
<v Speaker 1>I think judge [inaudible] that being </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1495
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>trump may not be great on eminent </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>

1496
01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:32.034
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he might want this wall to cut </v>

1497
01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:33.984
<v Speaker 1>through things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1498
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 1>who knows where that will the walls at </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1499
01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:36.174
<v Speaker 1>But I assure you he would have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem using eminent domain to make a </v>

1500
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>cut through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1501
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1502
01:03:41.301 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 1>there are all these dangers involved and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just want to see as the ball moving</v>

1503
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:48.360
<v Speaker 1>in the freedom direction all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And right now it is.</v>

1504
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:51.690
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely see moral hazards.</v>

1505
01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I definitely look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a Milo.</v>

1506
01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:54.204
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's such a good example cause I </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at him and they're things that he </v>

1507
01:03:57.151 --> 01:04:01.290
<v Speaker 1>does that I make me laugh out loud and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think it's wonderful.</v>

1508
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:04.350
<v Speaker 1>He's here and then suddenly he'll say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and I'll think,</v>

1509
01:04:04.351 --> 01:04:05.184
<v Speaker 1>except we don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to give credence to </v>

1510
01:04:08.521 --> 01:04:10.110
<v Speaker 1>hatred and evil.</v>

1511
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it evil,</v>

1512
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:14.730
<v Speaker 1>evil is bigger than irony and evil will </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat irony,</v>

1513
01:04:14.731 --> 01:04:15.564
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to be careful about </v>

1514
01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:17.334
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1515
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I feel that that could have been the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending,</v>

1516
01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you one </v>
<v Speaker 1>other thing,</v>

1517
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:22.583
<v Speaker 1>which is do you fear perhaps that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces which have grown so fat and it </v>

1518
01:04:27.921 --> 01:04:30.210
<v Speaker 1>were so drunk on their own power and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1519
01:04:30.211 --> 01:04:31.044
<v Speaker 1>now that it's starting to crumble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you fear that they will hit back on </v>

1520
01:04:34.801 --> 01:04:39.060
<v Speaker 1>people like you and people like me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever in a way that we made don't,</v>

1521
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.340
<v Speaker 1>we may not understand yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1522
01:04:41.341 --> 01:04:41.780
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1523
01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 1>that thing that they did with the Han </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole solo and the Gif,</v>

1524
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:46.583
<v Speaker 1>where are the meme was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a warning shot only of the way that </v>

1525
01:04:50.911 --> 01:04:53.370
<v Speaker 1>they're going to try to treat the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who go against them.</v>

1526
01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.433
<v Speaker 1>I think we've seen it with these leaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the intelligence community about </v>

1527
01:04:57.151 --> 01:04:57.984
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump did this and they turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>out some of those leaks turned out not </v>

1528
01:05:00.391 --> 01:05:03.210
<v Speaker 1>to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the press was perfectly happy to say</v>

1529
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.250
<v Speaker 1>sources within the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

1530
01:05:05.251 --> 01:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>former officials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

1531
01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does a former official,</v>

1532
01:05:07.681 --> 01:05:08.491
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter.</v>

1533
01:05:08.491 --> 01:05:09.324
<v Speaker 1>They were putting on a front page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the front page on the New York </v>

1534
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Washington Post.</v>

1535
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the deep state striking back.</v>

1536
01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to continue to fight.</v>

1537
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>This is a genuine battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a genuine battle for,</v>

1538
01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1539
01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a battle for the future.</v>

1540
01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this global world,</v>

1541
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:26.343
<v Speaker 1>which has many good things in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think free trade and global </v>

1542
01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:29.974
<v Speaker 1>communication and all of this also </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed a small group of people to make </v>

1543
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>decisions on unelected people to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions for,</v>

1544
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>for people who had no way to redress </v>
<v Speaker 1>their grievances.</v>

1545
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1546
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:48.600
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to become a global world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I want America to take it over that</v>

1547
01:05:48.601 --> 01:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an imperialist in that regard.</v>

1548
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>If we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the world's gonna be global,</v>

1549
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.713
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's living under the </v>

1550
01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:54.380
<v Speaker 1>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1551
01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the way it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>

1552
01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.020
<v Speaker 1>if everybody's not living under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution in Saudi Arabia,</v>

1553
01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:02.140
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to live under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution than I want Saudi Arabia to</v>

1554
01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:02.974
<v Speaker 1>stay in Saudi Arabia and I want Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabians to stay in Saudi Arabia unless </v>

1555
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:09.100
<v Speaker 1>they want to come over here to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the constitution.</v>

1556
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.040
<v Speaker 1>So those are the choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1557
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:11.883
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way to frame it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a global world run by the </v>

1558
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Constitution or America first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
