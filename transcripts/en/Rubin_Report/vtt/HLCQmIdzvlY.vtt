1
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.883
<v Speaker 1>Joining me as an evolutionary biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formerly of Evergreen State University </v>

2
00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:13.270
<v Speaker 1>who is now a professional professor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>exile,</v>

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Heather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi and welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having today's professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>in exile.</v>

5
00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I believe that is in your twitter bio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is in your husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein's twitter bio.</v>

7
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We generated it together.</v>

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to be the title of the Co </v>
<v Speaker 1>authored a book when the dust settles on</v>

9
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:30.544
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff?</v>

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.463
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I think both of us are both eager to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave the evergreen story behind,</v>

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.243
<v Speaker 2>but still heartbroken that an </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution that we loved and still </v>

13
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:43.614
<v Speaker 2>believe in the educational model that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>offered and still believe in the </v>

14
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 2>students who got great education was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for many decades.</v>

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.543
<v Speaker 2>We would love to see it resurrected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't look like it's going to </v>

16
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

17
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

18
00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:58.234
<v Speaker 1>so this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little crazy to me that this is </v>

19
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>the first time that we've met because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously our,</v>

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.663
<v Speaker 1>our circles have been sort of a closing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in on each other for for quite some </v>

21
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:07.384
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

22
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>when the whole evergreen thing happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I only want to spend a little bit of</v>

23
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:10.774
<v Speaker 1>time at the top talking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I want to do all sorts of </v>

24
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.180
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biology stuff and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

25
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>the other things that you're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate about,</v>

26
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.343
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it was more focused on Brett </v>

27
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>and then he was sort of thrust into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media and all that,</v>

28
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.110
<v Speaker 1>but this was a direct attack on you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well in the end,</v>

29
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:26.944
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the institution that you loved and all </v>

30
00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:28.744
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you just give me any sort of recap </v>

31
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.253
<v Speaker 1>or just pieces of it that maybe we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that well or just your perspective </v>

32
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 1>on what was happening there?</v>

33
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

34
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as briefly as I can,</v>

35
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.400
<v Speaker 2>leaving out many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many relevant pieces,</v>

36
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.133
<v Speaker 2>we got a new president and the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>president very quickly got rid of a </v>

37
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:49.144
<v Speaker 2>provost who was going to get in his way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and spoke publicly about his desire to </v>

38
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Speaker 2>turn evergreen into a social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>

39
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 2>I was actually on the record early in </v>
<v Speaker 2>George Church's tenure at the point that</v>

40
00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 2>the protests broke out a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

41
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.013
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had been president for about two </v>

42
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 2>years and a year before that had broken </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in equity,</v>

43
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.960
<v Speaker 2>a desire to bring equity and inclusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the forefront,</v>

45
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is cohorts.</v>

46
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.773
<v Speaker 2>It's dog whistles for the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>far left who are actually interested in </v>

47
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 2>a reversal of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an end to oppression,</v>

48
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 2>but an actual reversal of historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression.</v>

49
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys recognize those things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog whistles at the time?</v>

50
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Because as Brett said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time he considers himself,</v>

51
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>or at least at that time did consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself deeply progressive.</v>

52
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You just said to me right before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

53
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 1>you still consider yourself progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

54
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>So did you realize those buzzwords and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they actually meant at the time?</v>

55
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

56
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:49.704
<v Speaker 2>Brett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I was on sabbatical the year </v>

57
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.253
<v Speaker 2>most of the year before this breakout is</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of why I was disappeared from the </v>

58
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:55.854
<v Speaker 2>story I said as I went on to sabbatical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will continue to read everything </v>

59
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.790
<v Speaker 2>you want to send out to these lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not engaging.</v>

60
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my own work now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So about a year,</v>

61
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>actually a year to the day before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest broke out,</v>

62
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 2>the first announcement of the new plan </v>
<v Speaker 2>came,</v>

63
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 2>came live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

64
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 2>and there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for the next year,</v>

65
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.883
<v Speaker 2>Brett was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a little bit a couple of other </v>

66
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>people were a little bit standing up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

67
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't smell right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

68
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>this feels like this is actually about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that we're not talking about.</v>

69
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.613
<v Speaker 2>And furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're actually interested in </v>

70
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 2>improving the fate of various </v>
<v Speaker 2>demographic groups,</v>

71
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 2>these processes are not going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to accomplish them.</v>

72
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.903
<v Speaker 2>So we were saying that Brett mostly was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that a few others of us were </v>

73
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:44.314
<v Speaker 2>saying it.</v>

74
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there any,</v>

75
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.033
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of understanding of that point of </v>

76
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 2>view privately?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

77
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Privately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

78
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.473
<v Speaker 2>People were scared and when in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Brett used the phrase culture of </v>

79
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:01.444
<v Speaker 2>fear on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what came back at him was you have to </v>

80
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 2>prove that there's a culture of fear or </v>
<v Speaker 2>else there's not one.</v>

81
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.353
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me the people who aren't standing </v>

82
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>up or else I will know that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist,</v>

83
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.150
<v Speaker 2>which is baffling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

84
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.043
<v Speaker 2>it is obviously unimprovable an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unprovable statement to say there's a </v>

85
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:23.434
<v Speaker 2>culture of fear and I'm not going to out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who have come to me and told </v>

86
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 2>me they're scared because I actually am </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to honor their privacy,</v>

87
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.453
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everyone who would come to us </v>

88
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:36.480
<v Speaker 2>privately and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is nuts and it's got to stop,</v>

89
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.503
<v Speaker 2>had stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have been a totally different </v>

90
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:39.754
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>

91
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the culture of fear summed </v>
<v Speaker 1>up right there.</v>

92
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

93
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.511
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

94
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>So without rehashing the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you just tell me a little,</v>

95
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.293
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit about sort of how your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life has changed throughout this and </v>

96
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:49.601
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:50.381
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and Brett,</v>

98
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>you guys did settle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't for a ton of money,</v>

99
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>at least in my humble estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you probably want it to just</v>

100
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>put some of this behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are professors in exile you</v>

101
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:00.214
<v Speaker 1>if you have kids and family and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and just sort of sum up kind of </v>

102
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:03.634
<v Speaker 1>where you're at at the moment.</v>

103
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we had,</v>

104
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.280
<v Speaker 2>we'd been living in Olympia for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

105
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

106
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.393
<v Speaker 2>the college was an amazing place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really do a deep dive in community with </v>

107
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:15.390
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

108
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.323
<v Speaker 2>Brad and I had done one and I had done </v>
<v Speaker 2>several long study abroad trips and </v>

109
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:20.534
<v Speaker 2>Panama and in Ecuador with pretty large </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups of undergraduates taking them </v>

110
00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:25.910
<v Speaker 2>through the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're galapagos.</v>

111
00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:28.340
<v Speaker 2>We spent time in the field in Washington</v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

112
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:33.050
<v Speaker 2>in the San Juans and eastern Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're took people places where not only</v>

113
00:05:33.051 --> 00:05:37.430
<v Speaker 2>were we studying evolutionary biology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and animal behavior and field techniques</v>

114
00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:39.290
<v Speaker 2>and Statistics and philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

115
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>but also coming to know each other such </v>
<v Speaker 2>that after,</v>

116
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.030
<v Speaker 2>after you break bread with people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>days and you play ultimate with them and</v>

117
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.883
<v Speaker 2>sit around a campfire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come to understand that when they </v>

118
00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:53.324
<v Speaker 2>disagree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not inherently coming from a place </v>

119
00:05:55.551 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 2>of hatred or personal.</v>

120
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 2>And so that trust that we were able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create in our classrooms,</v>

121
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.224
<v Speaker 2>which both of us love to doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed us to effectively then rip the </v>

122
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:08.444
<v Speaker 2>intellectual rug out from under people </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they made claims that weren't </v>

123
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.863
<v Speaker 2>falsifiable or couldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't be justified once you </v>

124
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 2>started to ask them what the assumptions</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there underlying their claims.</v>

125
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was an amazing gift.</v>

126
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know that really almost any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other educational model out there allows</v>

127
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 2>for that because it required the time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build community with students,</v>

128
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was wonderful.</v>

129
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:33.190
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lost two tenure track jobs along with</v>

130
00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:34.024
<v Speaker 2>your health insurance and our retirement</v>
<v Speaker 2>plans and all of that and have two kids </v>

131
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 2>still in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's alarming.</v>

132
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 2>But some of what we were doing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classroom,</v>

133
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 2>we have begun to do on larger stages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is promising.</v>

134
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.483
<v Speaker 2>It seems clear that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in hearing how to understand </v>

135
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 2>systems from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

136
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.503
<v Speaker 2>I knew that was true from the 25 or 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>students that I had doing the deep dive </v>

137
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.250
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

138
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 2>every quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year for years.</v>

139
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that surprising,</v>

140
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 2>but it is heartening to see that that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the response of many,</v>

141
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 2>many people out there</v>

142
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.720
<v Speaker 1>in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it almost feel right then that this</v>

143
00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:13.531
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:14.364
<v Speaker 1>I know it's kind of sucky and again with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salaries in tenure track positions </v>

145
00:07:16.891 --> 00:07:17.724
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the message that you guys are </v>

146
00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:22.350
<v Speaker 1>talking about seems so relevant right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

147
00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:24.720
<v Speaker 1>You guys are now doing more public </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking gigs.</v>

148
00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dragging bread onstage with me to do</v>

149
00:07:27.121 --> 00:07:27.954
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all sorts of crazy things are </v>

150
00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:30.684
<v Speaker 1>presenting themselves and then the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rise of this new alliance of </v>

151
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.650
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to call it intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark web or whatever you want to call it</v>

152
00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:38.560
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>

153
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.403
<v Speaker 1>there is this sort of interesting crew </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people with a lot of different </v>

154
00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:42.984
<v Speaker 1>feelings on a lot of different issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all sorts of different disciplines </v>

155
00:07:45.691 --> 00:07:46.524
<v Speaker 1>coming together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if you guys were still at </v>

156
00:07:48.361 --> 00:07:49.194
<v Speaker 1>university in a traditional sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to be dealt in the </v>

157
00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:52.650
<v Speaker 1>way that</v>

158
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you are now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's possible.</v>

159
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I think there is both a way in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>having gone through the looking glass,</v>

160
00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:01.980
<v Speaker 2>having gone through the direct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.873
<v Speaker 2>to borrow a phrase from the far left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the lived experience of actually </v>

162
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 2>being at the center of a mob at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>center of riots and then watching as the</v>

163
00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:16.560
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream media and others tried to</v>

164
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.423
<v Speaker 2>do a public relations spin on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell a totally different story to live </v>

165
00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:22.314
<v Speaker 2>that and to watch the institution that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you love to become totally disloyal to </v>

166
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:28.530
<v Speaker 2>you and to watch many people whom you </v>
<v Speaker 2>respected,</v>

167
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hide.</v>

168
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.423
<v Speaker 2>You can't unsee that it's valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that we're sitting here </v>

169
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:39.030
<v Speaker 2>talking together and that many of us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the intellectual,</v>

170
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:42.330
<v Speaker 2>dark web and in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this bigger group are,</v>

171
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.373
<v Speaker 2>are speaking and saying actually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture of fear that is society wide is </v>

172
00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:48.324
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

173
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.373
<v Speaker 2>And so I'll say the first time I met my </v>
<v Speaker 2>students after the November 2016 </v>

174
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:57.410
<v Speaker 2>election after trump was elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evergreen,</v>

175
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 2>so very left place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympia is a very left place.</v>

176
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much everyone on campus had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>glazed eyes.</v>

177
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:04.194
<v Speaker 2>Slack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jawed Lux that people in most </v>

178
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 2>progressive enclaves will be familiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>with from that time,</v>

179
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 2>from those few days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

180
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Myself included,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I was no hillary fan,</v>

181
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't see that outcome coming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly didn't vote for trump.</v>

182
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.933
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 2>we got to class and my co faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whom I admired greatly,</v>

184
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.823
<v Speaker 2>I just proceeded with her lecture on </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse evolution and I'm looking around </v>

185
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:28.794
<v Speaker 2>the classroom going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one here cares about horses the day </v>

186
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 2>to day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

187
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.023
<v Speaker 2>so she ended up at early and we had lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of hours later and before she </v>

188
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 2>let them go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

189
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anyone wants to stay,</v>

190
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 2>this is no longer class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if anyone wants to stay,</v>

191
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I would be happy to lead a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what just happened,</v>

192
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>what just happened to our country.</v>

193
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.730
<v Speaker 2>And about 40 of our 50 students stayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and skip their lunch hour.</v>

194
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 2>And then we went right to anatomy lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>that afternoon from,</v>

195
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.210
<v Speaker 2>from this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I said to them was,</v>

196
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 2>do not for a minute believe that racists</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sexist elected trump.</v>

197
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.573
<v Speaker 2>Think about how many times you have had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to censor yourself on this campus when </v>

198
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:09.894
<v Speaker 2>you had an opinion that was even </v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly different from the accepted </v>

199
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:18.681
<v Speaker 2>Dogma and that conversation not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought life to the realm,</v>

200
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 2>but afterwards I had several students </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up to me,</v>

201
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:22.764
<v Speaker 2>some of them in tears telling me stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>about one of them had lost a job on </v>

202
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 2>campus for speaking in opinion that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>not accepted.</v>

203
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.330
<v Speaker 2>One of them had an another story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>another friend who lost a job.</v>

204
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Others talked about their self </v>
<v Speaker 2>censorship and I'm that and all of these</v>

205
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 2>people again were four left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that it should matter,</v>

206
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.074
<v Speaker 2>but these weren't even people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives or who held conservative </v>

207
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:46.464
<v Speaker 2>views so that that is the larger culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fear that is hardly restricted to </v>

208
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 2>evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is society wide that we're,</v>

209
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.373
<v Speaker 2>that we're speaking about and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are responding to because in at </v>

210
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at starbucks,</v>

211
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 2>in cubicles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in campuses,</v>

212
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:05.364
<v Speaker 2>but far be on campuses across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and across the weird country is </v>

213
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 2>at least this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

214
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:10.990
<v Speaker 2>the irony too</v>

215
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.823
<v Speaker 1>me is that I think that all that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is talking about these things </v>

216
00:11:14.501 --> 00:11:17.890
<v Speaker 1>often with people who have a much better</v>
<v Speaker 1>pedigree than I do,</v>

217
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.933
<v Speaker 1>but by me talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's giving room for other people to </v>

218
00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:23.500
<v Speaker 1>talk about it and that's all that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

219
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

220
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are also so</v>

221
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.470
<v Speaker 2>providing ways into the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

222
00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:31.810
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people when </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted with.</v>

223
00:11:31.811 --> 00:11:34.960
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to think that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

224
00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not actually sure how to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

225
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

226
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the linguistic skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the analytics behind me.</v>

227
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm supposed to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

228
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.454
<v Speaker 2>And so just listening to you and to Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris and the Jordan Peterson into </v>

229
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.673
<v Speaker 2>Brett and to Eric and to me and to many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many others I believe begins to give </v>

230
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:57.010
<v Speaker 2>people a sense of not only is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>doable,</v>

231
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 2>these are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable,</v>

232
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 2>smart people who are being respectful in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying,</v>

233
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.060
<v Speaker 2>but also it's not just tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually like phrase it,</v>

234
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what you can say.</v>

235
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.313
<v Speaker 2>These are the things that sort of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can say in response that are </v>

236
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.063
<v Speaker 2>still respectful and don't reject the </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity of the person on the other </v>

237
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do reject the argument.</v>

238
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost shows that</v>

239
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.110
<v Speaker 1>were you guys obviously were doing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well at a university level.</v>

240
00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:24.540
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what's needed at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>societal level.</v>

241
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:25.374
<v Speaker 1>Now talking about the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language to get these ideas across </v>

242
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.953
<v Speaker 1>is is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder is there a evolutionary </v>

243
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.710
<v Speaker 1>explanation for a little bit of what has</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened here with the left,</v>

244
00:12:37.711 --> 00:12:38.544
<v Speaker 1>like the way they've sort of closed off </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranks and then purge everyone because </v>

245
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.433
<v Speaker 1>it's just as I sit here with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the idea that you and Brett </v>

246
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.193
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be enough of whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want is so bananas and yet it </v>

247
00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:51.534
<v Speaker 1>is true.</v>

248
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.623
<v Speaker 2>So is there some way that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain that coming from the discipline </v>

249
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Speaker 2>you come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's.</v>

250
00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I think this is not going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly deep point,</v>

251
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:03.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basic ingroup outgroup dynamics and</v>

252
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.233
<v Speaker 2>we will always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will not get rid of of tribal </v>

253
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will not get rid of our sense of,</v>

254
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I are aligned,</v>

255
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

256
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a way in which there's a kind of</v>

257
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.790
<v Speaker 2>tribalism there even though we just met </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time today and you know,</v>

258
00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 2>and we definitely have political </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences for sure.</v>

259
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Which we can talk about if we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

260
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.743
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

261
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.940
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't the main thing.</v>

262
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're aligned and I,</v>

263
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:27.904
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel walking in here like you've got </v>

264
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:34.291
<v Speaker 2>my back and you've got my back and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people especially raised without</v>

265
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:39.244
<v Speaker 2>much experience with the physical world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and raised often in situations where </v>

266
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:45.904
<v Speaker 2>they're being given a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceuticals early on that are </v>

267
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:49.474
<v Speaker 2>disrupting development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrive at what should be the cusp of </v>

268
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 2>adulthood and aren't sure how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate,</v>

269
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.220
<v Speaker 2>aren't sure how to navigate the waters.</v>

270
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 2>And so when told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

271
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 2>if you just agree with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just become an idea log and go in</v>

272
00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:05.860
<v Speaker 2>lock step with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be with us.</v>

273
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.293
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity politics is appealing because </v>

274
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:09.814
<v Speaker 2>it provides an instant in group if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will only subjugate yourself and your </v>

275
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics on this side,</v>

276
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 2>b gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anti politics on this side of course,</v>

277
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 2>because anyone who shows up here and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>told no,</v>

278
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 2>you don't have enough of what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive stack tells us you made,</v>

279
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:23.523
<v Speaker 2>either you can totally subjugate </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself or go over there and we'll of </v>

280
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:27.640
<v Speaker 2>course we're going to get a rise over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and back and forth</v>

281
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.330
<v Speaker 1>when people criticize us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever this is for not focusing on that</v>

282
00:14:32.331 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>identity politics enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that,</v>

283
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.750
<v Speaker 1>the secondary one that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about here,</v>

284
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.550
<v Speaker 1>which is the identity politics of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

285
00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:40.550
<v Speaker 1>which is either which is based in actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism or,</v>

286
00:14:40.551 --> 00:14:41.384
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a white ethno state or ideas </v>

287
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:43.664
<v Speaker 1>that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the antithesis of the American </v>

288
00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:49.250
<v Speaker 1>experiment is to me they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ridiculous and have no real real</v>

289
00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:50.084
<v Speaker 1>world traction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we've this boogeyman </v>

290
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.850
<v Speaker 1>because we need it long since been </v>
<v Speaker 1>displayed.</v>

291
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

292
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Almost no one thinks that way anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

293
00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.571
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

294
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>so what's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your best argument against that?</v>

295
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:02.271
<v Speaker 1>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

296
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:03.104
<v Speaker 1>you're not focusing on that enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>because because everyone wants </v>

297
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:05.864
<v Speaker 1>everything to be equal all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're focusing on the identity </v>

298
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:10.100
<v Speaker 1>politics of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which clearly many of us see as.</v>

299
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly see it.</v>

300
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

301
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.073
<v Speaker 1>I really believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I view it as the greatest existential </v>

302
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 1>threat to western democracy that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

303
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:24.221
<v Speaker 1>I believe that if there's something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would cause us to be on the streets like</v>

304
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 1>killing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's that we're.</v>

305
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:30.020
<v Speaker 1>We'll have broken off and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities will will disappear,</v>

306
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.943
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is the best argument </v>

307
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:32.354
<v Speaker 1>for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not focusing on that one enough </v>

308
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 1>because I see that a lot now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

309
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think two things.</v>

310
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.880
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as big a group,</v>

311
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:39.981
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

312
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:40.814
<v Speaker 2>the white nationalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extent that they exist and they do </v>

313
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.770
<v Speaker 2>are better armed by and large than than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the far left,</v>

314
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.280
<v Speaker 2>but numerically they just don't exist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same numbers and they don't have the</v>

315
00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:53.844
<v Speaker 2>kind of play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the kind of cultural </v>

316
00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:57.990
<v Speaker 2>reach that the far left does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the second.</v>

317
00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's three points.</v>

318
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.793
<v Speaker 2>A secondary point then is everyone can </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk white nationalists that is </v>

319
00:16:04.921 --> 00:16:08.880
<v Speaker 2>completely acceptable and in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>demanded that you do when those sorts of</v>

320
00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:12.480
<v Speaker 2>ideas come up in conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the stuff on the far left,</v>

321
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.540
<v Speaker 2>increasingly it is demanded that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

322
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.540
<v Speaker 2>So there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the key right there.</v>

323
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.760
<v Speaker 2>So like we are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

324
00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:21.594
<v Speaker 2>actually we must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we must disagree with this just as much </v>

325
00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:24.630
<v Speaker 2>as we should.</v>

326
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.463
<v Speaker 2>Just as much as culturally we now know </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a norm to disagree with what's on </v>

327
00:16:28.081 --> 00:16:29.970
<v Speaker 2>the right we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the far right.</v>

328
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:34.770
<v Speaker 2>It should become a cultural norm to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with frankly the cryptic racism</v>

329
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.270
<v Speaker 2>and sexism and everything else that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening on the far left.</v>

330
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.373
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes packaged as if it's anti </v>

331
00:16:42.451 --> 00:16:44.190
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti sexist and all,</v>

332
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.100
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's racist and sexist against the other</v>

333
00:16:47.101 --> 00:16:47.934
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a flipping of the tables of </v>

334
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.250
<v Speaker 2>oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say the third point is,</v>

335
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.293
<v Speaker 2>for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as someone who has been on the left my </v>

336
00:16:56.581 --> 00:16:58.020
<v Speaker 2>whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

337
00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.883
<v Speaker 2>this has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this experience is going through the </v>

338
00:17:00.511 --> 00:17:03.630
<v Speaker 2>looking glass in the last year has not </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed my values,</v>

339
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.733
<v Speaker 2>but it has changed what I understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how people are using language to </v>

340
00:17:10.591 --> 00:17:12.840
<v Speaker 2>make other people out to be things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

341
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:13.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

342
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.790
<v Speaker 2>I no longer believe in a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>outright for instance.</v>

343
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

344
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.123
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boogeyman that are out there that </v>

345
00:17:21.301 --> 00:17:23.640
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to do things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to Fox News.</v>

346
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

347
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.750
<v Speaker 2>actually we should all be exposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves to,</v>

348
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.190
<v Speaker 2>to the media across the entire range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me on the left,</v>

349
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 2>it's actually my job much more so than </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go after people who I have nothing in</v>

350
00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:42.330
<v Speaker 2>common with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go after the people who claim to have</v>

351
00:17:42.331 --> 00:17:43.164
<v Speaker 2>values that are similar to mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I see that they are actually </v>

352
00:17:45.331 --> 00:17:46.440
<v Speaker 2>achieving goals that are different.</v>

353
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I love this conversation </v>

354
00:17:48.921 --> 00:17:53.921
<v Speaker 1>and don't get tired of it because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in on it at different levels.</v>

355
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:54.894
<v Speaker 1>We all have different realizations at </v>
<v Speaker 1>different times along the timeline and </v>

356
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I free for two years.</v>

357
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I kept saying I'm of the left and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I want to fix this.</v>

358
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:05.424
<v Speaker 1>I don't think realistically anymore I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can honestly say that I think I have </v>

359
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 1>more in common certainly with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians and I find it.</v>

360
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:11.783
<v Speaker 1>I find an intellectual openness with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives that I just don't find </v>

361
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On this other side,</v>

362
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and I know there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

363
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I know there's some people you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke at Heterodox,</v>

364
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 1>a Heterodox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan hates been on the show.</v>

365
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:23.004
<v Speaker 1>I think he's doing wonderful work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously people like Brett and </v>

366
00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:26.344
<v Speaker 1>like Eric and and Steven pinker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty and Sam and plenty of other that </v>

367
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:30.684
<v Speaker 1>exists still as sort of a same left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I see that just being whittled and </v>

368
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:35.934
<v Speaker 1>whittled and whittled away and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that it's not worth taking </v>

369
00:18:38.621 --> 00:18:39.454
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it means it's the most worthy </v>

370
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.243
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just see it as like an </v>

371
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:44.970
<v Speaker 1>increasingly untenable position to hold.</v>

372
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are actually many,</v>

373
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:50.700
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people out there who are not,</v>

374
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 2>who don't have public platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are waiting,</v>

375
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 2>who've been waiting for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are watching your.</v>

376
00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Most of these people would consider the </v>
<v Speaker 2>songs themselves Democrats,</v>

377
00:18:59.821 --> 00:19:02.040
<v Speaker 2>as I always did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

378
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to identify as a Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore given what they know,</v>

379
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 2>stand for a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most I think that and this,</v>

380
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as evidenced by my inbox.</v>

381
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.263
<v Speaker 2>So it's anecdotal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lot of anecdotes and you </v>

382
00:19:14.691 --> 00:19:15.524
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also my twitter feed a that there </v>

383
00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:18.744
<v Speaker 2>are a massive number of people out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are on the left who have values on </v>

384
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 2>the left and who find no one out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was making sense except now.</v>

385
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

386
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.350
<v Speaker 2>it has taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has taken this to,</v>

387
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.340
<v Speaker 2>you have this fever pitch that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrived at a for a number of people.</v>

388
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I really think and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Google starbucks,</v>

389
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.913
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just those big stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people writing to me and to </v>

390
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Brett from just average workplaces </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

391
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.103
<v Speaker 2>I'm in fear for my job because I cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak anything that doesn't fit the </v>

392
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:58.860
<v Speaker 2>dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just hired an equity advisor.</v>

393
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 2>We just hired an inclusion advisor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

394
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.563
<v Speaker 2>and it's hateful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hateful rhetoric that we are being </v>

395
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.304
<v Speaker 2>told to adopt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's happening across </v>

396
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.813
<v Speaker 2>corporate America now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course most Americans are not going </v>

397
00:20:12.151 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 2>to appreciate that.</v>

398
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it existed at the universities</v>

399
00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:16.354
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and finally it started </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbling out of there and those kids </v>

400
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.400
<v Speaker 1>took those ideas and started entering </v>
<v Speaker 1>the workforce.</v>

401
00:20:21.401 --> 00:20:22.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

402
00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:23.464
<v Speaker 1>people say you're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're focusing on college students too </v>

403
00:20:25.121 --> 00:20:25.954
<v Speaker 1>much and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do realize they get out of college </v>

404
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.423
<v Speaker 1>usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

405
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.393
<v Speaker 1>If they're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me a little bit more about sort </v>

406
00:20:32.351 --> 00:20:33.184
<v Speaker 1>of what you're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you just spoke at Heterodox and </v>

407
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or let's start.</v>

408
00:20:35.921 --> 00:20:36.754
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with that</v>

409
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.643
<v Speaker 2>heterodox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

410
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

411
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.710
<v Speaker 2>the Heterodox Academy's first </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>

412
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they and fire are really at the </v>

413
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:47.661
<v Speaker 2>forefront institutionally of defending </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint diversity on campuses.</v>

414
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.330
<v Speaker 2>A fire from sort of more of a legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and Heterodox at the faculty</v>

415
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.190
<v Speaker 2>administrative perspective and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

416
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.103
<v Speaker 2>It was an intense conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only conference I've ever been to </v>

417
00:20:57.731 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 2>where I thought they should have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>

418
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:01.190
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a daisy.</v>

419
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 2>All academics in the audience as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do they open that up?</v>

420
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.993
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there were probably </v>

421
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.953
<v Speaker 2>non-academics there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that there were a lot of </v>

422
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 2>journalists there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

423
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.600
<v Speaker 2>and most everyone I met were students or</v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty or Admin or journalists.</v>

424
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.730
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the,</v>

425
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.710
<v Speaker 2>what the entry rules were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

426
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 2>the panels were as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Jonathan Heit at the end of the day,</v>

427
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

428
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.353
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Count only three people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the panels of I guess 28 people who </v>

429
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 2>might be conservative.</v>

430
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.450
<v Speaker 2>So he himself pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 2>we're striving for viewpoint diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact is it's an uphill battle,</v>

432
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to get just,</v>

433
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.023
<v Speaker 2>just like we shouldn't expect a 50 slash</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 sex ratio amongst software software </v>

434
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:47.584
<v Speaker 2>engineers between men and women were </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to get a 50 slash 50 </v>

435
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 2>ratio of liberals and conservatives on </v>
<v Speaker 2>college campuses.</v>

436
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:54.843
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily the kind of work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that conservatives flocked to in the </v>

437
00:21:57.671 --> 00:21:58.504
<v Speaker 2>same numbers as liberals do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we need to be careful about </v>

438
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 2>imagining what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what equity would look like as in all of</v>

439
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 2>these arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At an ideal level,</v>

440
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:12.871
<v Speaker 2>why would it be that conservatives would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be less inclined to be doing academics?</v>

441
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I guess it depends on what our </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of conservative is.</v>

442
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.493
<v Speaker 2>One of stereotype that comes to mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I may regret saying is that a </v>

443
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:27.030
<v Speaker 2>liberal types take some odd pride and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not caring about making a good living,</v>

444
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.100
<v Speaker 2>making good money in faculty positions </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to tend to fit that right?</v>

445
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Certainly Evergreen did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

446
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

447
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:38.134
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if what if one of your primary goals is </v>

448
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:43.010
<v Speaker 2>not only to make a good living for </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

449
00:22:43.011 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 2>but potentially to leap out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>living you're making and you know,</v>

450
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:50.140
<v Speaker 2>really hit it big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're unlikely to do that in academia.</v>

451
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a,</v>

452
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.080
<v Speaker 2>there's a sort of a risk aversion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm to the prospect of making it</v>

453
00:22:59.231 --> 00:23:04.231
<v Speaker 2>big financially that academics tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that maybe,</v>

454
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe conservatives would be less likely</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

455
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.653
<v Speaker 2>to go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it could also be the </v>

456
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:11.170
<v Speaker 2>conservatives were just self selecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

457
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.360
<v Speaker 2>like they realized the hostile </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere.</v>

458
00:23:13.361 --> 00:23:15.220
<v Speaker 2>So they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would I do this?</v>

459
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.143
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is one of the explanations for </v>

460
00:23:17.441 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

461
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly in some fields,</v>

462
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an engineered the,</v>

463
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.130
<v Speaker 2>the less human focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the field,</v>

464
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 2>the more conservatives there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know this.</v>

465
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.180
<v Speaker 2>So in engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

466
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 2>in the physical sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly people don't speak their politics</v>

467
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 2>on college campuses if they are on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right because they're not welcome there.</v>

468
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.043
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

469
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.063
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those fields do have higher </v>

470
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:42.430
<v Speaker 2>representations of conservatives than </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals.</v>

471
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.770
<v Speaker 2>But most of the social sciences and </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanities,</v>

472
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:45.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all always tended liberal but are </v>

473
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 2>even more so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the numbers off the top</v>

474
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 2>of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more so now than they ever have</v>

475
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a problem to have,</v>

476
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

477
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a field that is trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand the nature of humans,</v>

478
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.913
<v Speaker 2>any of the social sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology or anthropology or sociology </v>

479
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:09.430
<v Speaker 2>to be entirely limited to people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left side of the political spectrum.</v>

480
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.993
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're missing something in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation of what humans are if you </v>

481
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:17.990
<v Speaker 2>don't have anyone who's willing to speak</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a different political position.</v>

482
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.380
<v Speaker 2>So when I've talked</v>

483
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.320
<v Speaker 1>to Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you referenced and my friend Peter,</v>

484
00:24:22.321 --> 00:24:24.660
<v Speaker 1>but goes in and a couple other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are professors,</v>

485
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably know Pete,</v>

486
00:24:26.521 --> 00:24:27.354
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

487
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of their argument is based</v>

488
00:24:30.751 --> 00:24:32.030
<v Speaker 1>around that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:32.913
<v Speaker 1>gender studies and these sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sort of new fueled basically have </v>

490
00:24:38.251 --> 00:24:42.370
<v Speaker 1>a completely separate set of standards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been.</v>

491
00:24:42.371 --> 00:24:43.204
<v Speaker 1>It had virtually nothing to do with any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the standards that you as an </v>

492
00:24:45.871 --> 00:24:50.550
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologist had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to and have to prescribe to,</v>

493
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.700
<v Speaker 1>to do your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that really the crux of it?</v>

494
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Sort of at the institutional level at </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools</v>

495
00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.773
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is at least one of the first site </v>

496
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.500
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have seen as well,</v>

497
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:06.210
<v Speaker 2>that there are many new fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of which end in the word studies,</v>

498
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like gender studies that are there.</v>

499
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.913
<v Speaker 2>They're made up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are based in postmodernism and not </v>

500
00:25:14.731 --> 00:25:15.564
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just postmodernism because at its </v>

501
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.860
<v Speaker 2>base originally there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some stuff of value there,</v>

502
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:20.723
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the new manifestations in critical </v>

503
00:25:23.881 --> 00:25:24.714
<v Speaker 2>theory and such are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are basically free of any fact checking </v>

504
00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:30.390
<v Speaker 2>apparatus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they are,</v>

505
00:25:30.391 --> 00:25:32.640
<v Speaker 2>they are anti science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti enlightenment,</v>

506
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.733
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're quite willing to say things </v>

507
00:25:35.401 --> 00:25:37.210
<v Speaker 2>like reason is a tool.</v>

508
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the new one.</v>

509
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.300
<v Speaker 1>This sort of popping up in the last six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

510
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

511
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

512
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.513
<v Speaker 2>you just have to know you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people who are not going to be </v>

513
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 2>playing in good faith and willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an.</v>

514
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

515
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.440
<v Speaker 2>viable argument at the point that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that,</v>

516
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:52.971
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

517
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 2>that there has been capture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

518
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:58.100
<v Speaker 2>pretty pretty solid capture and a few of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more traditional fields.</v>

519
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

520
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I met several people at Heterodox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

521
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.330
<v Speaker 2>who are sociologists who are fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>this from within,</v>

522
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:07.490
<v Speaker 2>but sociology is one of the captured </v>
<v Speaker 2>fields,</v>

523
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.653
<v Speaker 2>anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geography and cultural anthropology in </v>

524
00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:13.514
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the fact that it is that there </v>

525
00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:18.794
<v Speaker 2>are fields that students can go into and</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically never be exposed to the idea </v>

526
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:29.060
<v Speaker 2>of you're going to generate as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible explanations for the thing that</v>

527
00:26:29.061 --> 00:26:29.894
<v Speaker 2>you've observed as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do hypothesis generation </v>

528
00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:35.510
<v Speaker 2>first and then we're going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what would have to be true if</v>

529
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:36.344
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if each of those individual hypotheses </v>

530
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:41.150
<v Speaker 2>were true and then we're going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to test between them.</v>

531
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the scientific method and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inefficient.</v>

532
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.083
<v Speaker 2>It sometimes gets things wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is the only tool we have to over </v>

533
00:26:52.461 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 2>time get to a better and better </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the universe.</v>

534
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

535
00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 2>there's no method over in gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>

536
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how have you seen that way of </v>

537
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:04.524
<v Speaker 1>thinking leak into the harder sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this seems to be the next </v>

538
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:09.354
<v Speaker 1>frontier.</v>

539
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

540
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:12.703
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some schools now that when </v>

541
00:27:15.561 --> 00:27:17.910
<v Speaker 2>positions come open in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

542
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.670
<v Speaker 2>in science disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for most schools,</v>

543
00:27:21.671 --> 00:27:22.504
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't sure at Evergreen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at most schools through the hiring </v>

544
00:27:24.321 --> 00:27:25.830
<v Speaker 2>apparatus within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

545
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.130
<v Speaker 2>within department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

546
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.430
<v Speaker 2>someone in physics retires and physics </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to the society,</v>

547
00:27:31.431 --> 00:27:32.264
<v Speaker 2>the Physics Faculty and Department Chair</v>
<v Speaker 2>and such get to decide what kind of </v>

548
00:27:34.851 --> 00:27:35.684
<v Speaker 2>physicists they're going to hire next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow increasingly science educators </v>

549
00:27:40.491 --> 00:27:43.460
<v Speaker 2>are being as being hired rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists themselves.</v>

550
00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:44.294
<v Speaker 2>And science educator is a code word for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people coming out of Ed schools and </v>

551
00:27:48.201 --> 00:27:52.640
<v Speaker 2>education schools have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this pathogen very,</v>

552
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.503
<v Speaker 2>very badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm science educators being hired </v>

553
00:27:56.331 --> 00:27:57.164
<v Speaker 2>into positions that should have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists means that now you have a </v>

554
00:27:59.601 --> 00:28:00.434
<v Speaker 2>weakening of scientific voice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific method in science </v>

555
00:28:02.991 --> 00:28:05.900
<v Speaker 2>departments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have A.</v>

556
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.793
<v Speaker 2>I mean even was it just recently nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think published one of the two big </v>

557
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.090
<v Speaker 2>science journals published.</v>

558
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.073
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was a letter or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>article arguing that one of the primary </v>

559
00:28:19.581 --> 00:28:24.050
<v Speaker 2>things that science needs to be focusing</v>
<v Speaker 2>on is increasing diversity.</v>

560
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.030
<v Speaker 2>So you have two problems with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are your measures of diversity?</v>

561
00:28:29.031 --> 00:28:31.010
<v Speaker 2>It's the stuff that you can see on first</v>
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>

562
00:28:31.011 --> 00:28:31.844
<v Speaker 2>This is immutable characteristics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with actually all the </v>

563
00:28:34.341 --> 00:28:35.174
<v Speaker 2>other kinds of diversity that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and that you know and that </v>

564
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.060
<v Speaker 2>we can change things like political </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief and you know,</v>

565
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.903
<v Speaker 2>some things that we can't change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but things like being on the autism </v>

566
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:46.190
<v Speaker 2>spectrum or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like,</v>

567
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>colorblindness or dyslexia or lefthand </v>

568
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.520
<v Speaker 2>and is all of which provide your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>without us ever being conscious of it.</v>

569
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:53.443
<v Speaker 2>Some different way of approaching the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and that kind of diversity in a </v>

570
00:28:56.181 --> 00:28:58.040
<v Speaker 2>group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ads,</v>

571
00:28:59.150 --> 00:28:59.983
<v Speaker 2>ads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual intrigue and nuanced to </v>

572
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.150
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>

573
00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm a lefty with a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dyslexia.</v>

574
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lefty too.</v>

575
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

576
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lefty is like,</v>

577
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like many other members of these groups </v>

578
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:12.234
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I happened to happen at other lefty one </v>

579
00:29:13.441 --> 00:29:15.120
<v Speaker 2>because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done some research on it.</v>

580
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Lefties are overrepresented at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

581
00:29:17.331 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 2>in the National Academy of Sciences and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mental institution.</v>

582
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.303
<v Speaker 1>You've got this really big spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now I can see that there's really </v>

583
00:29:24.581 --> 00:29:27.640
<v Speaker 1>two options for your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

584
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.833
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about consciousness a little </v>

585
00:29:29.981 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had Sam Harrison,</v>

586
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.790
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about it quite extensively.</v>

587
00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I think you have some thoughts on </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

588
00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.690
<v Speaker 1>the nature of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

589
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably do this right.</v>

590
00:29:42.191 --> 00:29:43.024
<v Speaker 2>We would need to agree on a definition </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not sure that that's any </v>

591
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:46.714
<v Speaker 2>definition that we choose will </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately antagonized some amount of </v>

592
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 2>your audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like defining,</v>

593
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.410
<v Speaker 2>defining truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be tough these days.</v>

594
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

595
00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe,</v>

596
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe rather than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

597
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.200
<v Speaker 2>are humans the only conscious beings on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this planet?</v>

598
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we are the most conscious.</v>

599
00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:08.734
<v Speaker 2>We are the most fully conscious and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have better access to our own </v>

600
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:15.520
<v Speaker 2>consciousness obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we have access to the consciousness</v>

601
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.383
<v Speaker 2>of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins or elephants or other apes or </v>

602
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:25.650
<v Speaker 2>maybe a wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any of these long lived social organisms</v>

603
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:27.424
<v Speaker 2>with long childhoods and generational </v>
<v Speaker 2>overlap who lived sometimes with three </v>

604
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:31.954
<v Speaker 2>generations together at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's transmission of cultural </v>

605
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:34.924
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms that have theory of mind and </v>

606
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:41.680
<v Speaker 2>can imagine can put themselves in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other individual's position and think,</v>

607
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:43.720
<v Speaker 2>what do they think is going on right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

608
00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.553
<v Speaker 2>Even though I understand that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different thing than what I think is </v>

609
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:47.374
<v Speaker 2>going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we now know that certain monkeys </v>

610
00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:51.350
<v Speaker 2>and apes exactly do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

611
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:52.303
<v Speaker 2>theory of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a beautiful book called Baboon </v>

612
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.753
<v Speaker 2>Metaphysics by the husband and wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>team Chaney and Seyfarth that basically </v>

613
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:02.290
<v Speaker 2>explores theory of mind and baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

614
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:02.741
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

615
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:04.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

616
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 2>they're not the only spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

617
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we as humans find our </v>

618
00:31:10.181 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 2>consciousness best?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

619
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.293
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ways that we can hack into </v>

620
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.260
<v Speaker 2>what is sometimes been called flow </v>
<v Speaker 2>states or um,</v>

621
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

622
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.190
<v Speaker 2>that's the most common one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

623
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.540
<v Speaker 2>we can do so through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well through deep conversation,</v>

624
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through meditation,</v>

625
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 2>through music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sometimes through producing it,</v>

626
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:32.920
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes through experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially live music,</v>

627
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.210
<v Speaker 2>dance for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hallucinogens,</v>

628
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport,</v>

629
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:40.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intense physical or physiological or </v>

630
00:31:44.081 --> 00:31:49.081
<v Speaker 2>emotional experience in which we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just moving with others usually.</v>

631
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.880
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are those of us like myself,</v>

632
00:31:51.881 --> 00:31:52.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong introvert who will find so </v>

633
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 2>my deepest flow states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

634
00:31:55.571 --> 00:31:56.404
<v Speaker 2>access to consciousness alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're alone in the Amazon when I could </v>

635
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 2>sit and watch monkeys and write that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

636
00:32:02.531 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 2>That's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sport is also.</v>

637
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.870
<v Speaker 2>So when I talked about this with Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he was defining it,</v>

638
00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:10.180
<v Speaker 2>which I think is sort of similar to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying here,</v>

639
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.373
<v Speaker 2>it strikes me as just like an extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to maintain present in the </v>

640
00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 2>moment that that really sort of when a </v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball player.</v>

641
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:22.120
<v Speaker 2>So if we use the sport analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a basketball player when they're in</v>

642
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:23.020
<v Speaker 2>the zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

643
00:32:23.021 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 2>and Jordan scores 20 points in five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and he just,</v>

644
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.590
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

645
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.423
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I threw up just went in like </v>

646
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.473
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hit that level of consciousness or </v>

647
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:32.254
<v Speaker 2>for you to be outside enough out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to be able to write in that </v>

648
00:32:35.981 --> 00:32:38.180
<v Speaker 2>perfect moment or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is that it.</v>

649
00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.013
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it always seems about present more than </v>

650
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:40.930
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

651
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.770
<v Speaker 2>there is a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

652
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 2>time stopping both time stopping and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappearing on you at the same time,</v>

653
00:32:47.781 --> 00:32:50.880
<v Speaker 2>which I think is part of why entheogenic</v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucinogens can,</v>

654
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:51.743
<v Speaker 2>can capture that as well because their </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of time just disappearing on you </v>

655
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is remarkable.</v>

656
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

657
00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.313
<v Speaker 2>you both don't care about time and time </v>
<v Speaker 2>passes usually in ways that seemed </v>

658
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.640
<v Speaker 2>quicker than you were expecting them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

659
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a sport or um,</v>

660
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.830
<v Speaker 2>or right meditation that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

661
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.670
<v Speaker 2>that's not one that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

662
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:15.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam has a lot to say about that.</v>

663
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

664
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was doing mushrooms at</v>

665
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 2>least sort of in college age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat consistently,</v>

666
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:24.374
<v Speaker 2>maybe every six months or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would always want the clocks to be </v>

667
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 2>covered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

668
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Because I hated the numbers are no good.</v>

669
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.103
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely did one trip like five </v>

670
00:33:34.461 --> 00:33:35.730
<v Speaker 2>hours in a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget that,</v>

671
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:36.763
<v Speaker 2>but I always wanted the clocks to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered because the idea that time was </v>

672
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:43.400
<v Speaker 2>passing while I was in this state was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was very scary to me.</v>

673
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's scary.</v>

674
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Or just I just wanted nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

675
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe it doesn't matter what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that distinction is,</v>

676
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:51.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary or just not interested.</v>

677
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

678
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:53.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

679
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.793
<v Speaker 2>it's very different than the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness enhancing activities that </v>

680
00:33:58.131 --> 00:33:58.964
<v Speaker 2>we can engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including hallucinogens are very </v>

681
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:01.604
<v Speaker 2>different if you're inside in a room </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this where you have no access to </v>

682
00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:05.234
<v Speaker 2>what is going on climate illogically or </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather-wise outside as opposed to if </v>

683
00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:09.974
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are out and you can watch as the </v>

684
00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:16.430
<v Speaker 2>sunsets and as the moon comes up and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can think again,</v>

685
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.031
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

686
00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:18.680
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

687
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 2>it's a waxing moon.</v>

688
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:23.150
<v Speaker 2>It'll be full in four days and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

689
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:24.043
<v Speaker 2>or you're at a coast and you can watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tides and think about the shifting </v>

690
00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

691
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:29.323
<v Speaker 2>thinking about time that is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>being brought as clearly being revealed </v>

692
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.113
<v Speaker 2>by the planet we're on as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming at me through a clock is more </v>

693
00:34:40.101 --> 00:34:40.934
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and I'm willing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to think about time in that </v>

694
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:43.844
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but definitely not through clocks when </v>

695
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm writing hallucinogen sport,</v>

696
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.000
<v Speaker 2>any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

697
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:49.933
<v Speaker 2>And yet we have all of these devices now</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our men our time that are meant to </v>

698
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:59.630
<v Speaker 2>take our attention that are literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed this way.</v>

699
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:00.464
<v Speaker 2>Do you sense we're on so that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a digital assault on </v>

700
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:04.544
<v Speaker 2>consciousness because maybe that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>does explain so many of the other </v>

701
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 2>problems we're having in society right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

702
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.360
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the key pieces for sure.</v>

703
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think that phrase is brilliant at </v>
<v Speaker 2>digital assault on consciousness.</v>

704
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 2>This is something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Tristan Harris who I don't know,</v>

705
00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Speaker 2>but I've got them on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

706
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Talks talks about a lot and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

707
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.083
<v Speaker 2>he has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has been ringing the alarm bell for </v>

708
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:29.420
<v Speaker 2>years about the algorithms that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being put into our devices that are,</v>

709
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.660
<v Speaker 2>that are creating addicts out of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But more broadly,</v>

710
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the digital assault on consciousness is,</v>

711
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.390
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

712
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.313
<v Speaker 2>it's increasingly hard to find a space </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're just actually free and </v>

713
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:43.974
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

714
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is part of what I do for myself and</v>

715
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:49.650
<v Speaker 2>what I used to do for my students was </v>
<v Speaker 2>take them to places,</v>

716
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 2>not only that we're remote and where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could explore nature,</v>

717
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.670
<v Speaker 2>but where there was no cell signal where</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no internet.</v>

718
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.533
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deepest part of the Amazon that I </v>

719
00:35:58.501 --> 00:35:59.400
<v Speaker 2>took students to.</v>

720
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no email,</v>

721
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:02.490
<v Speaker 2>there's no internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no Wifi.</v>

722
00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:03.324
<v Speaker 2>We are a plane ride over the Andes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then a boat ride and then a truck ride </v>

723
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.423
<v Speaker 2>and then another five hours down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tributary of the Amazon to a place </v>

724
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 2>with no roads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no airstrips,</v>

725
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And boy does time feel different and you</v>

726
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:20.124
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sleeping in little cabins that </v>

727
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:22.404
<v Speaker 2>are screened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you wake up when the insects and </v>

728
00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:27.600
<v Speaker 2>the birds and the monkeys wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they start talking at you.</v>

729
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.190
<v Speaker 2>They're not talking to you the document </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

730
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.443
<v Speaker 2>but you getting a sense of the rhythms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the planet that we're on can return </v>

731
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.240
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to a real sense of self and also</v>

732
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:42.690
<v Speaker 2>to a sense of what they value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what their passions are.</v>

733
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 2>And this is a big thing I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing in many of the.</v>

734
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.400
<v Speaker 2>To return to what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>

735
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:47.891
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

736
00:36:47.891 --> 00:36:49.770
<v Speaker 2>the far left activists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

737
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.860
<v Speaker 2>the control left mostly I think lack </v>
<v Speaker 2>another passion.</v>

738
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.240
<v Speaker 2>And I've said before I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

739
00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.293
<v Speaker 2>the prediction I would make is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have very few rock climbers or scares </v>

740
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:03.383
<v Speaker 2>among the radical left activists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who have something that they can </v>

741
00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:10.290
<v Speaker 2>engage in that frees them from time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>devices from,</v>

742
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Speaker 2>from a response to time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be here then,</v>

743
00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:15.660
<v Speaker 2>or this my thing just pinged me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to look at it,</v>

744
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:17.183
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are better able to center themselves to </v>

745
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>find their own consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discover who,</v>

746
00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 2>who they are and what they want to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

747
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.450
<v Speaker 2>What does that say about the self?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think?</v>

748
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:28.973
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something there about like if </v>

749
00:37:30.031 --> 00:37:34.410
<v Speaker 2>you really believe in the self and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the individually and your ability to</v>

750
00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:35.244
<v Speaker 2>overcome things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need all of these external </v>

751
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:38.424
<v Speaker 2>processes to help define the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're sort of defining it </v>

752
00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:42.534
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

753
00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:43.443
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree and I think I do think for me </v>

754
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:50.880
<v Speaker 2>self sufficiency is one of my highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>values personally and I have a.</v>

755
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I have a very hard time understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who says,</v>

756
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you leave me on my own,</v>

757
00:37:56.431 --> 00:37:57.890
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

758
00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.640
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get this.</v>

759
00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't get why you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a lefty thing.</v>

760
00:38:01.551 --> 00:38:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

761
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:04.530
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would.</v>

762
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Why would you broadcast to the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would be helpless?</v>

763
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.210
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't make any sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

764
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.053
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are plenty of situations where I </v>

765
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:13.524
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't know what to do and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to do in situations that most </v>

766
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:17.490
<v Speaker 2>people wouldn't just because of where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've traveled and where I've lived,</v>

767
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.833
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that self sufficiency </v>
<v Speaker 2>require the idea that you want to be </v>

768
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:24.810
<v Speaker 2>self sufficient requires a concept of </v>
<v Speaker 2>self,</v>

769
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I think is is important here.</v>

770
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just maybe that.</v>

771
00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you give that up,</v>

772
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 2>well then boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're giving up a lot.</v>

773
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.620
<v Speaker 2>You give up so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the devices as,</v>

774
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 2>as heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Tristan Harris has argued,</v>

775
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.570
<v Speaker 2>are addicting us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no accident.</v>

776
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:46.991
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

777
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should not view ourselves actually as</v>

778
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:50.500
<v Speaker 2>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

779
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:54.430
<v Speaker 2>when we get addicted to the things we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should wean ourselves.</v>

780
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.900
<v Speaker 2>We should as much as possible to provide</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves zones,</v>

781
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:02.440
<v Speaker 2>periods of time when we have no access </v>
<v Speaker 2>to those things.</v>

782
00:39:02.441 --> 00:39:03.274
<v Speaker 2>And so we are actually free and clear to</v>
<v Speaker 2>let our minds do what they will because </v>

783
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:08.800
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>

784
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 2>when they have access to our brands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are designed to addict us.</v>

785
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.833
<v Speaker 2>So using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using the discipline that you're an </v>

786
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:16.264
<v Speaker 2>expert in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that we're in a unique </v>

787
00:39:20.201 --> 00:39:21.034
<v Speaker 2>position right now because of technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our brains are actually evolving </v>

788
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:29.530
<v Speaker 2>now evolving or I guess devolving </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on which way you look at it at</v>

789
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:33.700
<v Speaker 2>an extraordinarily high pace or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>

790
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:34.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

791
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.553
<v Speaker 2>the rate of change across almost every </v>
<v Speaker 2>sector in the economy and in human </v>

792
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 2>experience right now is higher than it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been.</v>

793
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Could you say that about any moment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>history maybe,</v>

794
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 2>but the rate of change itself is </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing as well.</v>

795
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's the important distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

796
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:52.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what is going on with technology is </v>

797
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 2>completely untested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is,</v>

798
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 2>this is a place where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

799
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:02.074
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I so certain that I'm still on </v>

800
00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:04.534
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though most of the people who say </v>

801
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:07.054
<v Speaker 2>they're on the left publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any interest in continuing </v>

802
00:40:09.521 --> 00:40:12.040
<v Speaker 2>to talk to them because they don't seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be making any sense.</v>

803
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I look at systems that are involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

804
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.510
<v Speaker 2>that are in stable state because they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved over millions,</v>

805
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:21.190
<v Speaker 2>tens of millions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of millions of years.</v>

806
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 2>And my instinct is don't mess with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you really,</v>

807
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:28.660
<v Speaker 2>really understand what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for instance,</v>

808
00:40:28.661 --> 00:40:29.494
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike many scientists and not feeding </v>

809
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:32.374
<v Speaker 2>my children gmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give them and myself organic food and </v>

810
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:37.990
<v Speaker 2>when we meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we do a lot of,</v>

811
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I want that meat to have been fed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass,</v>

812
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:45.640
<v Speaker 2>if it's the food of its ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what or what exactly is the harm?</v>

813
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.180
<v Speaker 2>We now know a little bit of this but 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago if you would ask me what's the</v>

814
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 2>harm and feeding cows grants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have no idea,</v>

815
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:53.583
<v Speaker 2>but I know that messing with a system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was working is more likely to </v>

816
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:02.440
<v Speaker 2>interfere with something in that animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>then not why,</v>

817
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you mess if you could not,</v>

818
00:41:05.261 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 2>and of course their economic reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mess.</v>

819
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.250
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

820
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't mess with systems that are working</v>

821
00:41:11.501 --> 00:41:14.230
<v Speaker 2>until you really have a solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what the,</v>

822
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:15.303
<v Speaker 2>what the effects are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The use of the precautionary principle </v>

823
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:20.620
<v Speaker 2>pretty widely is what puts me pretty far</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left,</v>

824
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.000
<v Speaker 2>but systems that we've created that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary,</v>

825
00:41:25.001 --> 00:41:25.834
<v Speaker 2>but people don't know that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulate in order to get them under </v>

826
00:41:29.711 --> 00:41:30.544
<v Speaker 2>control because nuclear energy isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna regulate itself and habitat loss </v>

827
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 2>throughout most of the world is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to regulate itself.</v>

828
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:38.683
<v Speaker 2>So there are some problems that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>created and that are bigger than </v>

829
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:42.920
<v Speaker 2>individuals can do anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

830
00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm not a libertarian.</v>

831
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

832
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:47.340
<v Speaker 1>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where I think we have.</v>

833
00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

834
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.553
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know that if you just leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody to do whatever the hell they </v>

835
00:41:51.871 --> 00:41:52.704
<v Speaker 1>want all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody isn't going to be doing </v>

836
00:41:53.671 --> 00:41:54.504
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of awful things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think generally the market does fix </v>

837
00:41:56.641 --> 00:41:58.140
<v Speaker 1>some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get what you're saying.</v>

838
00:41:58.141 --> 00:42:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Like these systems are I suppose often </v>
<v Speaker 1>precarious in nature too,</v>

839
00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.293
<v Speaker 1>to the point where anything can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tilted one way or the other and then </v>

840
00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.830
<v Speaker 1>we've got bigger problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

841
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:10.680
<v Speaker 1>So how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we fix some of this stuff?</v>

842
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.840
<v Speaker 1>How do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we actually scale this back?</v>

843
00:42:12.841 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

844
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my artists will get.</v>

845
00:42:14.941 --> 00:42:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we have to keep talking about it.</v>

846
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Should we have to wake more people up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

847
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 1>But what can you do using the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have in the study you've done?</v>

848
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.083
<v Speaker 2>I have less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have less insight right now at least </v>

849
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.030
<v Speaker 2>to answer in this amount of time for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult systems.</v>

850
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think I have a fair amount of </v>

851
00:42:34.901 --> 00:42:35.734
<v Speaker 2>clarity on what we should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be doing with children and with </v>

852
00:42:38.651 --> 00:42:40.060
<v Speaker 2>parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're really,</v>

853
00:42:40.061 --> 00:42:42.940
<v Speaker 2>really not doing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

854
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.670
<v Speaker 1>when you say the adult systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean like economic system?</v>

855
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:46.743
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

856
00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.730
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more specifically,</v>

857
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:53.260
<v Speaker 2>how do you get adults who were already </v>
<v Speaker 2>who they are to behave differently.</v>

858
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

859
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:58.980
<v Speaker 2>it's less clear to me what we can do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll show them for the purpose of,</v>

860
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.550
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the CIS.</v>

861
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also also,</v>

862
00:43:02.081 --> 00:43:03.720
<v Speaker 2>it's true that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

863
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.760
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not going to wade into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

864
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.650
<v Speaker 2>what we should do a better economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>system here.</v>

865
00:43:08.651 --> 00:43:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Now with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might do it later,</v>

866
00:43:09.701 --> 00:43:11.500
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

867
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.660
<v Speaker 2>but with regard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

868
00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

869
00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.560
<v Speaker 2>most people I think have never thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what childhood is and if you don't</v>

870
00:43:20.561 --> 00:43:22.090
<v Speaker 2>have children yourself and you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>adult,</v>

871
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.140
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't have to.</v>

872
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:24.063
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe it just doesn't matter to </v>

873
00:43:25.991 --> 00:43:27.940
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a parent,</v>

874
00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:29.763
<v Speaker 2>you need to think about why it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have literally the longest childhood </v>

875
00:43:34.571 --> 00:43:37.000
<v Speaker 2>relative to lifespan of any organism on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>

876
00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.313
<v Speaker 2>This is a feature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a way for us to learn how to </v>

877
00:43:41.081 --> 00:43:43.360
<v Speaker 2>become humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not,</v>

878
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.160
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a point that Brett has made very</v>

879
00:43:45.161 --> 00:43:47.050
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not blank slates,</v>

880
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.700
<v Speaker 2>but we are the blanket slates of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms on the planet.</v>

881
00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.460
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are more software than hardware.</v>

882
00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.990
<v Speaker 2>And so what we're doing for these first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

883
00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:02.890
<v Speaker 2>11 to 25 years of our lives right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the forties.</v>

884
00:44:02.891 --> 00:44:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I think it depends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but depending on culture,</v>

885
00:44:05.621 --> 00:44:06.454
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when do you start calling yourself an </v>

886
00:44:07.181 --> 00:44:08.014
<v Speaker 2>adult in the room?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're doing is learning how </v>

887
00:44:10.241 --> 00:44:11.074
<v Speaker 2>to be human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're learning how to be human by </v>

888
00:44:12.761 --> 00:44:13.594
<v Speaker 2>direct exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to be learning how to be </v>

889
00:44:15.401 --> 00:44:19.240
<v Speaker 2>human through instruction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>direct instruction by our parents,</v>

890
00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:22.360
<v Speaker 2>through observing our parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through observing our siblings,</v>

891
00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:25.270
<v Speaker 2>through interacting with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including fighting with our siblings and</v>

892
00:44:25.271 --> 00:44:27.790
<v Speaker 2>having them smack us down both sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>

893
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:30.220
<v Speaker 2>but definitely metaphorically when we do</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid things.</v>

894
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better yet,</v>

895
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.233
<v Speaker 2>if our parents have lots of adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends around and they have lots of </v>

896
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 2>kids and there's a whole mess of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity that we are learning from.</v>

897
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:40.223
<v Speaker 2>And then we're also in that very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>developmental period supposed to be </v>

898
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 2>learning from direct physical experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

899
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 2>So the example I like to go to here is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

900
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

901
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.113
<v Speaker 2>the roadrunner cartoons when Wiley </v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyote scoots is way off a cliff and he </v>

902
00:44:57.391 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fall until he realizes there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing below him.</v>

903
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.500
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

904
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Like it's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course it's funny because we know</v>

905
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:06.390
<v Speaker 2>the gravity doesn't really work that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

906
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.823
<v Speaker 2>Increasingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that a lot of kids and now </v>

907
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:16.070
<v Speaker 2>into the Ihn and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of the younger millennials kind</v>

908
00:45:16.071 --> 00:45:17.040
<v Speaker 2>of art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

909
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.173
<v Speaker 2>Like they were protected so much by </v>
<v Speaker 2>their helicopter parents and they were </v>

910
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:23.454
<v Speaker 2>behind screens rather than having real </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and to the extent that they </v>

911
00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 2>played sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was totally regulated and overseen by</v>

912
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:30.444
<v Speaker 2>adults and they didn't have any free </v>
<v Speaker 2>time to go and get themselves into </v>

913
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:34.314
<v Speaker 2>trouble and maybe even like burn </v>
<v Speaker 2>something down or hurt themselves or </v>

914
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:37.374
<v Speaker 2>break an arm or whatever it is and learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it that they arrive at the cusp of </v>

915
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 2>what should have been adulthood.</v>

916
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Totally unclear on what that supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>

917
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.823
<v Speaker 2>Does this absolutely to you because as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing you say that this is the </v>

918
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:51.930
<v Speaker 2>bell going off in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

919
00:45:51.931 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 2>I've been on tour where Peterson for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last six weeks.</v>

920
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Everything that you just said there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically what he is saying.</v>

921
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:00.144
<v Speaker 2>He is trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent that what he's trying to do at </v>

922
00:46:03.121 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 2>the most personal level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

923
00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:05.214
<v Speaker 2>He talks about society as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the most personal level he's </v>

924
00:46:07.771 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 2>trying to retool young people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even retool.</v>

925
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:15.210
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to give them the tools in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place that they clearly should</v>

926
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:16.450
<v Speaker 2>have gotten before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

927
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 2>so that's what's so fascinating to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like,</v>

928
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:21.810
<v Speaker 2>how did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

929
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.190
<v Speaker 2>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did this happen?</v>

930
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:24.024
<v Speaker 2>And we can point to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can point to pharmaceuticals being </v>

931
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 2>given to kids to make boys less boy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

932
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.610
<v Speaker 2>and to some degree to make girls less </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl like,</v>

933
00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:33.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give great,</v>

934
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.190
<v Speaker 2>let's give speed to boys.</v>

935
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 2>So they'll sit and face forward and </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn what.</v>

936
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.413
<v Speaker 2>So they'll calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm down and not do rough and tumble </v>

937
00:46:41.881 --> 00:46:44.250
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's insane.</v>

938
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.870
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's give antianxiety meds to girls and</v>

939
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.660
<v Speaker 2>SSR rise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

940
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.553
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just the model of schooling is </v>

941
00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:54.241
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

942
00:46:54.241 --> 00:46:55.074
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have schools that have gotten rid of </v>

943
00:46:56.101 --> 00:47:01.101
<v Speaker 2>recess because recess is dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who's ever been in school,</v>

944
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:02.843
<v Speaker 2>even if like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you happen to have been a good fit for </v>

945
00:47:04.741 --> 00:47:05.574
<v Speaker 2>the model of schools that you were in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is pretty rare actually </v>

946
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:10.043
<v Speaker 2>knows that you also need to have time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out there and play and move your </v>

947
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:14.664
<v Speaker 2>body and experience it and not have it </v>
<v Speaker 2>being overseen by some adult who's </v>

948
00:47:18.181 --> 00:47:21.300
<v Speaker 2>decided in advance what isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not safe for you to experience.</v>

949
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:21.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

950
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.420
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I used to say to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>students in advance,</v>

951
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.523
<v Speaker 2>we did a lot of team building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like actual team building and planning </v>

952
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.730
<v Speaker 2>with them in advance that these long </v>
<v Speaker 2>study abroad trips,</v>

953
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:31.564
<v Speaker 2>we would have spent weeks together on </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus in advance of going on these </v>

954
00:47:33.941 --> 00:47:34.774
<v Speaker 2>trips.</v>

955
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I wanted to do before we left </v>

956
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 2>was established with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your relationship with risk?</v>

957
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.230
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you view yourself,</v>

958
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.990
<v Speaker 2>your relationship with the risk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we would do this in round lake and I</v>

959
00:47:46.991 --> 00:47:48.990
<v Speaker 2>would answer the question to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I would say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I happen to love risk.</v>

961
00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 2>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the leader on this trip,</v>

962
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.513
<v Speaker 2>but I will keep all of you safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I'm going to go do things like </v>

963
00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:58.843
<v Speaker 2>I am going to walk alone in the forest a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot and do things because it happens to </v>

964
00:48:02.771 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 2>be one of the ways that I find my </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that I,</v>

965
00:48:05.441 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 2>that I find my truest self and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect any of you to do that also.</v>

966
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:11.104
<v Speaker 2>But you need to be comfortable with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that your leader is going to be </v>

967
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:13.570
<v Speaker 2>doing that sort of thing.</v>

968
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.600
<v Speaker 2>And one of the other things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would talk about was,</v>

969
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your relationship with comfort?</v>

970
00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to,</v>

971
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you can say in advance </v>

972
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.973
<v Speaker 2>you're okay with the bugs and the mud </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the not having a phone doesn't mean </v>

973
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 2>you actually will be when you're faced </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

974
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:35.160
<v Speaker 2>But maybe most important is we are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to leave ourselves open to serendipity.</v>

975
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 2>I cannot tell you everything that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do or learn on this trip.</v>

976
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:40.294
<v Speaker 2>If I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be the point of going we're </v>

977
00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 2>going to go and some interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to happen.</v>

978
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.263
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a couple of near death </v>

979
00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 2>experiences on these trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want them.</v>

980
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:53.130
<v Speaker 2>My didn't know and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

981
00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:54.143
<v Speaker 2>I was a learning experience where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a learning experience and frankly on </v>

982
00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.043
<v Speaker 2>the most recent one on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a boat in the galapagos with eight </v>

983
00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:04.720
<v Speaker 2>students in which the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't survive was the boat,</v>

984
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.000
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really touch and go.</v>

985
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really did almost die.</v>

986
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Those eight students and I are friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>for life.</v>

987
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

988
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.183
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some of them that I'm not an </v>

989
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:15.870
<v Speaker 2>active contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

990
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I know where they are and that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bonds you and no,</v>

991
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to pitch a trip with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew might die.</v>

992
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.053
<v Speaker 2>That's not what the goal is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that it could happen and </v>

993
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.560
<v Speaker 2>you should have the tools on board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physical tools,</v>

994
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.480
<v Speaker 2>psychological tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emotional tools,</v>

995
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:35.314
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual tools to figure out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>real time as your boat is being flipped </v>

996
00:49:39.461 --> 00:49:43.060
<v Speaker 2>by a 15 foot wave and now you're trapped</v>
<v Speaker 2>under it.</v>

997
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:48.690
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A uniquely Evergreen type of teaching?</v>

998
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Was that something that you and Brett </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

999
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.693
<v Speaker 2>that was a unique name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their knee kind of teaching and then </v>

1000
00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:55.690
<v Speaker 2>this last trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brett was there with me as well.</v>

1001
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.553
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a way in which I think what </v>

1002
00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:00.070
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I said about childhood,</v>

1003
00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:01.803
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1004
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:05.620
<v Speaker 2>my interest originally in evolution was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the evolution of parental care and</v>

1005
00:50:05.621 --> 00:50:06.454
<v Speaker 2>territoriality and social systems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual selection and long before I ever </v>

1006
00:50:11.081 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 2>had kids myself long before I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

1007
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.420
<v Speaker 2>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1008
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.273
<v Speaker 2>one sprint and I did have kids and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching these amazing creatures began </v>

1009
00:50:18.911 --> 00:50:19.900
<v Speaker 2>to grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1010
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:25.480
<v Speaker 2>let's think then about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the best way to do this?</v>

1011
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.793
<v Speaker 2>And we could put them a little boxes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make absolutely sure that they survive </v>

1012
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:32.744
<v Speaker 2>till the age of 18 and then we open up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boxes and we let them out and they </v>

1013
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:36.704
<v Speaker 2>have basically no chance of being adults</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even of knowing how to be adults or </v>

1014
00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:41.924
<v Speaker 2>we could expose them to ever greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk having first made absolutely sure </v>

1015
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:49.604
<v Speaker 2>that they know that they are loved and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have their backs and that we </v>

1016
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:57.230
<v Speaker 2>will do anything to come in and get them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to protect them if we can,</v>

1017
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 2>but that they are going to start going </v>
<v Speaker 2>out into the world pretty early,</v>

1018
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biking it too.</v>

1019
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.013
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we took him to the Amazon at seven and </v>

1020
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:07.550
<v Speaker 2>nine the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1021
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:10.430
<v Speaker 2>something could have gone wrong and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

1022
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I've known parents who lost kids and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how you survive that,</v>

1023
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:19.780
<v Speaker 2>but you need to be willing to take risks</v>
<v Speaker 2>such that when your kids do hit 18 or 20</v>

1024
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:21.494
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that they're actually already </v>

1025
00:51:23.301 --> 00:51:24.134
<v Speaker 2>on their way to being adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is gonna require backing off </v>

1026
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.653
<v Speaker 2>and letting them do some of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning on their own and knowing that </v>

1027
00:51:31.731 --> 00:51:32.564
<v Speaker 2>that's going to result in some harm </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to them and it's going to be </v>

1028
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 2>physical harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be psychological harm,</v>

1029
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:41.090
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be intellectual harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but frankly the lack of any kind of harm</v>

1030
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:44.320
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of kids are experiencing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of why they're now saying speeches,</v>

1031
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:45.810
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1032
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of how we get there.</v>

1033
00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.053
<v Speaker 1>If some of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extension of the success of the West </v>

1034
00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:53.714
<v Speaker 1>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you take the set of kids who </v>

1035
00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.190
<v Speaker 1>however old they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say we go from.</v>

1036
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Although now there's a lot of studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are showing that young,</v>

1037
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:04.430
<v Speaker 1>the generation younger than millennials </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually leaning more conservative.</v>

1038
00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:05.264
<v Speaker 1>But let's say we take 16 to 30 roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So generation y ish that you see that </v>

1039
00:52:10.851 --> 00:52:14.420
<v Speaker 1>most of their parents were baby boomers </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were the most successful,</v>

1040
00:52:14.421 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 1>at least financially generation ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the baby boomers,</v>

1041
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.434
<v Speaker 1>parents all went to war and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived through depression and all sorts </v>

1042
00:52:21.441 --> 00:52:22.274
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that because the baby boomer is </v>

1043
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:24.794
<v Speaker 1>basically where the biggest middle class</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because there was such upward </v>

1044
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:28.940
<v Speaker 1>mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had it so well,</v>

1045
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.983
<v Speaker 1>they kind of got their eye off the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started focusing on things that didn't </v>

1046
00:52:32.721 --> 00:52:33.554
<v Speaker 1>matter as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting kids from things that a kid </v>

1047
00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 1>would have used to have to have done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is sort of what led us here.</v>

1048
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:40.514
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like an economic backing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for what ended up happening </v>

1049
00:52:44.241 --> 00:52:45.074
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>

1050
00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1051
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I think that's apt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1052
00:52:47.051 --> 00:52:49.870
<v Speaker 2>there are so many things feeding into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and yes,</v>

1053
00:52:49.871 --> 00:52:51.950
<v Speaker 2>the wealth of America Post World War </v>
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>

1054
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.433
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that those are most of the </v>

1055
00:52:54.551 --> 00:52:58.780
<v Speaker 2>parents of the generation that seems the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most confused,</v>

1056
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I think definitely there's a causal link</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1057
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you toss in the Internet and </v>

1058
00:53:04.391 --> 00:53:06.780
<v Speaker 2>you toss on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1059
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1060
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't go back obviously,</v>

1061
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:12.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1062
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:14.583
<v Speaker 2>but we need to understand that it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary system and then it's going </v>

1063
00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:22.531
<v Speaker 2>to run away from us and that we are all </v>
<v Speaker 2>prone to be addicted to dopamine hits.</v>

1064
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:29.260
<v Speaker 2>We were going to the quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quick likes rather than,</v>

1065
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even.</v>

1066
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:32.214
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So take internet out of the picture for </v>

1067
00:53:32.971 --> 00:53:37.200
<v Speaker 2>a moment if you don't know what you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>for physical activity.</v>

1068
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I bike you play basketball.</v>

1069
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:39.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe with basketball it's going to </v>

1070
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 2>be different for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked video games too.</v>

1071
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:45.383
<v Speaker 2>Is that better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1072
00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.200
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the opposite.</v>

1073
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.493
<v Speaker 2>Probably the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I used to play a lot of ultimate </v>

1074
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:52.600
<v Speaker 2>frisbee and you could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1075
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:54.470
<v Speaker 2>like anytime there was a pickup game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1076
00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1077
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:56.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was playing five,</v>

1078
00:53:56.581 --> 00:53:57.414
<v Speaker 2>six times a week for awhile and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruptured my Achilles tendon playing on </v>

1079
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:02.010
<v Speaker 2>an Oregon beach with students a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1080
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1081
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.620
<v Speaker 2>but biking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I love and I find meditative.</v>

1082
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.193
<v Speaker 2>I have a very hard time convincing </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself to get on my bike even though </v>

1083
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:14.130
<v Speaker 2>while I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1084
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.203
<v Speaker 2>And after I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel better and I'm more productive </v>

1085
00:54:17.221 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 2>and a more creative and I just am more </v>
<v Speaker 2>in love with life,</v>

1086
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:26.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's a pain in the ass and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit physically uncomfortable.</v>

1087
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:28.980
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things are true.</v>

1088
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:31.760
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we prioritize the,</v>

1089
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.640
<v Speaker 2>the pleasure of now over even something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for me,</v>

1090
00:54:35.641 --> 00:54:36.474
<v Speaker 2>I know not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even that I'm going to feel </v>

1091
00:54:37.891 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 2>better after I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually love the activity itself.</v>

1092
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:45.120
<v Speaker 2>But getting over that sort of activation</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy to do the thing.</v>

1093
00:54:45.121 --> 00:54:45.954
<v Speaker 2>And I suspect that sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like actual team sports is a little bit </v>

1094
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:49.650
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little different.</v>

1095
00:54:49.651 --> 00:54:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you're ready to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ready to go.</v>

1096
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1097
00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.800
<v Speaker 2>people are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready.</v>

1098
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to the gym.</v>

1099
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:55.704
<v Speaker 2>I would like into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know that when I work out I like </v>

1100
00:54:57.851 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 2>doing it and I feel great after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

1101
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get in my car.</v>

1102
00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I got to drive over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a bark and blah blah blah.</v>

1103
00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:04.134
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a chore.</v>

1104
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you yet,</v>

1105
00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:06.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

1106
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:08.820
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're always fighting our nature sort</v>

1107
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 2>of we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1108
00:55:10.351 --> 00:55:11.184
<v Speaker 2>We're always fighting her nature and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't surprise us that we're going </v>

1109
00:55:13.311 --> 00:55:14.144
<v Speaker 2>to need to fight our nature with regard </v>
<v Speaker 2>to responding to the Internet and </v>

1110
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:18.923
<v Speaker 2>responding to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially especially the little </v>

1111
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.430
<v Speaker 2>computers we carry around in our pockets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1112
00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.293
<v Speaker 2>learning to restrict our access to those</v>
<v Speaker 2>training ourselves to restrict their </v>

1113
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:30.534
<v Speaker 2>access to those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think anyone with the ability to </v>

1114
00:55:32.551 --> 00:55:36.390
<v Speaker 2>train themselves to meditate or to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything on a regular basis should,</v>

1115
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.540
<v Speaker 2>should be able to train themselves that </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way with regard to devices.</v>

1116
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.690
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we've done about an hour here and I</v>

1117
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:46.590
<v Speaker 2>was going to demand that you come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know,</v>

1118
00:55:46.591 --> 00:55:47.424
<v Speaker 2>I know we can do way more of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate just because my schedule is </v>

1119
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:49.890
<v Speaker 2>so nuts at the moment.</v>

1120
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:50.723
<v Speaker 2>We have to kind of stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But can you give me one more thing that </v>

1121
00:55:52.561 --> 00:55:53.394
<v Speaker 2>you're just really excited about right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that you've been thinking about or </v>

1122
00:55:55.951 --> 00:55:59.280
<v Speaker 2>working on or anything else that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really just giving you a little bit,</v>

1123
00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:00.114
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of juice at the moment </v>

1124
00:56:01.321 --> 00:56:03.690
<v Speaker 2>while you're in this interesting space </v>
<v Speaker 2>for yourself?</v>

1125
00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:04.770
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1126
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.580
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of things I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1127
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.983
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a piece I wrote a number of </v>

1128
00:56:09.841 --> 00:56:13.140
<v Speaker 2>years ago that is supposed to be out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the literary magazine just about now,</v>

1129
00:56:13.141 --> 00:56:13.974
<v Speaker 2>ish about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been mugged at knife point and </v>

1130
00:56:16.651 --> 00:56:17.484
<v Speaker 2>Quito at one of these on one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>study abroad trips which prompt and I </v>

1131
00:56:20.701 --> 00:56:23.590
<v Speaker 2>was with three students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Quito the capital of Ecuador.</v>

1132
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1133
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the very,</v>

1134
00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:29.800
<v Speaker 2>it was before the first day of one of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>six week study abroad trips.</v>

1135
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 2>So 20 students just made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brent wasn't there on this one.</v>

1136
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the experience in which,</v>

1137
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd been,</v>

1138
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.290
<v Speaker 2>we'd been to get the three students that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been together all day.</v>

1139
00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:42.124
<v Speaker 2>We come to the top of the stairs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly two guys with with knives run </v>

1140
00:56:47.141 --> 00:56:47.974
<v Speaker 2>around the corner and pin me and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>female student up against a wall and do </v>

1141
00:56:51.191 --> 00:56:54.400
<v Speaker 2>this sort of knife dance in front of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then relieve.</v>

1142
00:56:54.401 --> 00:56:55.234
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anything on me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know how to walk around Latin American </v>

1143
00:56:57.611 --> 00:56:58.444
<v Speaker 2>cities and one of my students didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but two of my students had all of their </v>

1144
00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:02.134
<v Speaker 2>stuff taken off of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including this really nice dslr that </v>

1145
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Michelle and my student had and they run</v>
<v Speaker 2>off and the next thing I realize I am on</v>

1146
00:57:14.471 --> 00:57:18.070
<v Speaker 2>one of these guys in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street pulling on the backpack.</v>

1147
00:57:18.071 --> 00:57:19.630
<v Speaker 2>He's stolen from another one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>

1148
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:20.583
<v Speaker 2>Another one of my students has chased </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the other guy and thought how did </v>

1149
00:57:25.361 --> 00:57:29.290
<v Speaker 2>that happen and why is everything now so</v>
<v Speaker 2>loud and so colorful?</v>

1150
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And I thought back immediately thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1151
00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:33.364
<v Speaker 2>the entire experience that I just had </v>
<v Speaker 2>was somehow in black and white and was </v>

1152
00:57:38.471 --> 00:57:40.910
<v Speaker 2>without sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1153
00:57:40.911 --> 00:57:43.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting long story that,</v>

1154
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.373
<v Speaker 2>that I basically explored in this essay </v>
<v Speaker 2>by going into and doing a dive into the </v>

1155
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:48.634
<v Speaker 2>literature on the nature of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the nature of sensory memory in </v>

1156
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:55.150
<v Speaker 2>particular and what it is that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cannot perceive in the moment,</v>

1157
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:58.960
<v Speaker 2>what our brains take in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why time seems to slow down.</v>

1158
00:57:58.961 --> 00:58:00.940
<v Speaker 2>So just to go back to our early </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about time,</v>

1159
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:05.020
<v Speaker 2>why 10 time seems to slow down in </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of intensity.</v>

1160
00:58:05.021 --> 00:58:05.854
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it time slows down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically our frame rate increases </v>

1161
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:09.753
<v Speaker 2>and not only our frame rate increases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amount that we remember and you </v>

1162
00:58:13.061 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move into short term memory.</v>

1163
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.320
<v Speaker 2>And then in this case into longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory increases.</v>

1164
00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:19.990
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things that I've been</v>

1165
00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:24.520
<v Speaker 2>thinking about lately is sort of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how memory and the senses and in fact,</v>

1166
00:58:24.521 --> 00:58:26.200
<v Speaker 2>how all of us are a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>synesthesia.</v>

1167
00:58:26.201 --> 00:58:29.170
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are experiencing our world in ways that,</v>

1168
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:30.603
<v Speaker 2>that we don't usually have language for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that it was the purpose of the </v>

1169
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:34.300
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how did this all end?</v>

1170
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 2>It ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got,</v>

1171
00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:38.320
<v Speaker 2>we got the stuff back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got the stuff back,</v>

1172
00:58:38.321 --> 00:58:39.154
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as the student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy and I gave Tracy these guys and </v>

1173
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 2>got the stuff back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the police showed up,</v>

1174
00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:51.790
<v Speaker 2>then doppler it up from the end and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole were watching.</v>

1175
00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:53.790
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was remarkable actually.</v>

1176
00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.660
<v Speaker 2>It was totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no one on this walk.</v>

1177
00:58:55.661 --> 00:58:56.494
<v Speaker 2>We'd send no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These two guys run up to US Magus </v>

1178
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.083
<v Speaker 2>runoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We give chase and then the entire </v>

1179
00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:03.004
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood comes alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly there were hundreds of people </v>

1180
00:59:05.201 --> 00:59:05.891
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1181
00:59:05.891 --> 00:59:07.210
<v Speaker 2>where were you guys?</v>

1182
00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 1>There's some sort of study to be done on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1183
00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they've done studies on that.</v>

1184
00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:13.780
<v Speaker 1>You know when people see the bad thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

1185
00:59:13.781 --> 00:59:15.850
<v Speaker 1>but nobody calls the police and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>

1186
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been an absolute pleasure.</v>

1187
00:59:17.201 --> 00:59:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad that we finally got to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in person and we will do it again.</v>

1188
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:23.720
<v Speaker 1>You guys can follow heather on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

1189
00:59:23.721 --> 00:59:27.770
<v Speaker 1>She does tweet a decent amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not a unhealthy addicted amount.</v>

1190
00:59:27.771 --> 00:59:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's at heather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hiding.</v>
