<v Speaker 1>Rubin report presidents week with five </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows in five days on five former </v>

2
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>presidents of the United States in </v>
<v Speaker 1>partnership with learn.</v>

3
00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:17.261
<v Speaker 1>Liberty continues today and joining me </v>
<v Speaker 1>now is a professor of history at Western</v>

4
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:18.284
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut State University and author </v>
<v Speaker 1>of James Madison and the making of </v>

5
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:23.800
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin got made.</v>

6
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to be here.</v>

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to talk to you because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is big because you are both an expert in</v>

8
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:32.744
<v Speaker 1>James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now everyone that's watching this knows </v>

9
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>that Thomas Jefferson is my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>founder.</v>

10
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you a little room here</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play and by the end,</v>

11
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>see if you can convince me that James </v>
<v Speaker 1>Madison should be my favorite founder.</v>

12
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

13
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:48.944
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I want to play that game </v>
<v Speaker 2>because actually the reason I wrote a </v>

14
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:52.034
<v Speaker 2>book about Madison is because over time </v>
<v Speaker 2>I had come to think that his reputation </v>

15
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:56.774
<v Speaker 2>was generally exaggerated among scholars</v>
<v Speaker 2>that although he did very important </v>

16
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 2>things and I think he should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>remembered,</v>

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't as important as people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>remembering him as having been.</v>

18
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.980
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

19
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:07.814
<v Speaker 2>he's similar to Alexander Hamilton who </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't deserve all the accolades he's </v>

20
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 2>received from the musical Hamilton.</v>

21
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>you're shooting everywhere</v>

23
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying they were admirable people,</v>

24
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 2>but there's a tendency among biographers</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make their guys the central guys.</v>

25
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 2>So Hamilton becomes the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>American ever.</v>

26
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Madison becomes the smartest man ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

27
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.840
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you make him the real fellow,</v>

28
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.700
<v Speaker 2>he's still extremely interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

29
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.583
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that really is what your </v>

30
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.224
<v Speaker 1>book is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making him the real value in showing </v>

31
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>some of the flaws and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes he made along the way.</v>

32
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>And we're gonna get into all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just start at the beginning.</v>

33
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>What should we know about James </v>
<v Speaker 1>Madison's childhood?</v>

34
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.491
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

35
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:49.324
<v Speaker 2>Madison was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the first child of the most </v>

36
00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Speaker 2>important man in his county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was Piedmont Virginia,</v>

37
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Orange County in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Piedmont region,</v>

38
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 2>which is the area just off the coast of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia,</v>

39
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:01.204
<v Speaker 2>just out of tidewater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the western most extent of European </v>

40
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 2>settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his father,</v>

41
00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:10.180
<v Speaker 2>James Madison senior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the wealthiest man in the county.</v>

42
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:13.330
<v Speaker 2>He was the largest land holder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the largest slave holder.</v>

43
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.433
<v Speaker 2>He was the county lieutenant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means he was the commander of the </v>

44
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 2>county militia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was ahead of the vestry,</v>

45
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 2>which means he was the head of the lay </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization that ran the county,</v>

46
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Speaker 2>a parish of the established church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just the most important person.</v>

47
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 2>What this meant for James Madison junior</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he was set.</v>

48
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 2>He was going to inherit all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to be able to have the kind</v>

49
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:38.230
<v Speaker 2>of education that virtually nobody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Orange County would get.</v>

50
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's maybe the only person in his cohort</v>

51
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:44.230
<v Speaker 2>of Virginians who went off to Princeton </v>
<v Speaker 2>to college.</v>

52
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Most people would go to the colonial </v>
<v Speaker 2>college in Virginia,</v>

53
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:50.800
<v Speaker 2>William and Mary far inferior </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution in those days to Princeton.</v>

54
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 2>We could talk about whether it still is </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

55
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.910
<v Speaker 2>That's probably a different show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a different show.</v>

56
00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting question.</v>

57
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

58
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.900
<v Speaker 2>and James Madison Junior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of his tie to his father and his</v>

59
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.030
<v Speaker 2>father's eminent place ended up having </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

60
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.943
<v Speaker 2>not only a more elite kind of education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also a different outlook when it </v>

61
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.314
<v Speaker 2>came to human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between government and </v>

62
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.674
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual rights and especially what I </v>

63
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 2>think is the area in which he was most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

64
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of religion than other people.</v>

65
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was key in making sure that </v>

66
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>separation of church and state was part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the US Constitution.</v>

67
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Everything that's were we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to all that.</v>

68
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.033
<v Speaker 1>Do we know anything about his father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics or even just with even </v>

69
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>interested in politics when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>young?</v>

70
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.470
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't what we would call politics</v>

71
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.990
<v Speaker 2>in colonial Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

72
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.510
<v Speaker 2>there weren't parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't kind of party division.</v>

73
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were uh,</v>

74
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.190
<v Speaker 2>more or less all the same elite group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a common interest.</v>

75
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Virtually everybody who lived in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia was either tobacco grower,</v>

76
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 2>a slave on tobacco plantation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who lived in.</v>

77
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:03.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a small town that's the only kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of towns there were in Virginia and sold</v>

78
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:04.524
<v Speaker 2>tobacco or was a lawyer who worked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>tobacco farmers notice a common theme </v>

79
00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:08.814
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because people had a very similar </v>

80
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:11.484
<v Speaker 2>kind of economic life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have the kind of political </v>

81
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:15.810
<v Speaker 2>division we think of as normal.</v>

82
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost,</v>

83
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>it sorta sounds pre politics all </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

84
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>They were just sort of local and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda had to do what you did.</v>

85
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>

86
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.053
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes off to school and is this </v>

87
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>where he starts becoming more political?</v>

88
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.343
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what happened was he went off to </v>

89
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:35.720
<v Speaker 2>school in New Jersey and unlike William </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mary,</v>

90
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:36.554
<v Speaker 2>which was Episcopalian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the established Church of Virginia was </v>

91
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.250
<v Speaker 2>the Church of England.</v>

92
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.423
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of the reasons he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go there because we're going to </v>

93
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.730
<v Speaker 1>get into a little more about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings about religion,</v>

94
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>but obviously he wanted to go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger school,</v>

95
00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but was it also very much about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious school?</v>

96
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have any indication that that </v>

97
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:51.964
<v Speaker 2>had anything to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems that the reason he went off to </v>

98
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.053
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey was because of the very crude</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of scientific knowledge in those </v>

99
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if like James Madison Junior,</v>

100
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 2>who remains the smallest man who's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>been president,</v>

101
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 2>if you had what he called a sickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>

102
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 2>than you would want to avoid the vapors </v>
<v Speaker 2>around Williamsburg.</v>

103
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.643
<v Speaker 2>People thought there was something in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the air that made you sick and they had </v>

104
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>no idea of mosquito born illnesses or </v>
<v Speaker 2>any anything to do with sanitation.</v>

105
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.263
<v Speaker 2>So he went off to New Jersey because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was afraid he'd get sick if he went to </v>

106
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Williamsburg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is on the James near the coast.</v>

107
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

108
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.503
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of fortuitous that he ended </v>
<v Speaker 2>up at Princeton under the tutelage of </v>

109
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>somebody who was a minister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not an episcopalian.</v>

110
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.023
<v Speaker 2>And so were episcopalians at the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a kind of latitude and area in a </v>

111
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:45.124
<v Speaker 2>very liberal religious understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's motives and people's </v>

112
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

113
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had gone to Princeton and studied</v>

114
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:54.814
<v Speaker 2>under John Witherspoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would also be a signer of the </v>

115
00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:58.360
<v Speaker 2>declaration of independence in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

116
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 2>you would have been under the tutelage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of somebody who was a presbyterian.</v>

117
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 2>That is somebody who took calvinism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

118
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who thought men were naturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt,</v>

119
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.813
<v Speaker 2>somebody who was skeptical of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motives of other people and taught that </v>

120
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 2>this is the way a Christian should </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand human psychology.</v>

121
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.283
<v Speaker 2>And so if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're familiar with and think about </v>

122
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Madison's key political writings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

123
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 2>famous federalist number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>51 where he says if men were angels,</v>

124
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>no government would be necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but until we're governed by angels,</v>

125
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 2>let ambition counteract ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like John Witherspoon.</v>

126
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't have been saying that if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had gone to school at William and Mary.</v>

127
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of his individualism was really</v>

128
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 2>born there.</v>

129
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing about that is </v>

130
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.024
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that although the various elements of </v>

131
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 2>what I've been saying have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>weather spoons,</v>

132
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the religion of Princeton,</v>

133
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 2>generally madison was not in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Presbyterian.</v>

134
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.043
<v Speaker 2>We have very limited information about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what Madison's own personal religious </v>

135
00:06:57.921 --> 00:06:58.754
<v Speaker 2>beliefs were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it happened that he came back to </v>

136
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Virginia and within a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was serious.</v>

137
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:03.794
<v Speaker 2>There was one of the intermittent waves </v>
<v Speaker 2>of persecution of non episcopalians and </v>

138
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 2>then he ended up in a correspondence </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a fellow he had known at Princeton.</v>

139
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 2>This guy was from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Pennsylvania,</v>

140
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>so he had gone back home to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>

141
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.343
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like New Jersey had been founded by </v>

142
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 2>quakers and so never had any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>established church.</v>

143
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Quakers disbelieved in established </v>
<v Speaker 2>churches.</v>

144
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.283
<v Speaker 2>So Madison ends up writing to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of his from Princeton who's in </v>

145
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

146
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm ashamed of what's going on here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

147
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.493
<v Speaker 2>In a nearby county.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have half a dozen men who are in </v>

148
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

149
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 2>close jail for no other offense than </v>
<v Speaker 2>just preaching the Gospel.</v>

150
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Teaching people the Baptist </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of a spiritual reality,</v>

151
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 2>and of course that was illegal in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia.</v>

152
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 2>So they were thrown in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison in this fellow.</v>

153
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Then think through the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

154
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.613
<v Speaker 2>how ot government to be involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual's religious lives and the </v>

155
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 2>conclusion that Madison came to was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't.</v>

156
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.253
<v Speaker 2>That is he thought and he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to this conclusion and helping to </v>

157
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.004
<v Speaker 2>write the first American Declaration of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rights to the Virginia Declaration of </v>

158
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:10.034
<v Speaker 2>rights of 1776 that the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>English liberal and in Anglo American </v>

159
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:14.714
<v Speaker 2>liberal position on religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is we should have toleration in </v>

160
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:18.404
<v Speaker 2>England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a rule that you could be any </v>

161
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 2>kind of Protestant you wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sounds very,</v>

162
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 2>very oppressive to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slim version of the thing is though that</v>

163
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 2>in the context in the 18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were French,</v>

164
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 2>you had to be a catholic.</v>

165
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 2>If you are Turkish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to be a Muslim.</v>

166
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 2>If you were in England and you were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>an episcopalian,</v>

167
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't be in the House of Lords or</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be in the House of Commons.</v>

168
00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:39.014
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't go to Oxford or Cambridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general the English role was </v>

169
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:44.264
<v Speaker 2>we'll tolerate you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We won't punish you for not being an </v>

170
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Episcopalian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not like France or Spain or or</v>

171
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.143
<v Speaker 2>Turkey and I'm Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ends up with this idea that toleration </v>

172
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.183
<v Speaker 2>isn't enough and so when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>drafting the Virginia Declaration of </v>

173
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first American bill of rights,</v>

174
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.363
<v Speaker 2>the committee version of a religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>article of the declaration of Rights of </v>

175
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 2>said Virginians will be entitled to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fullest toleration matters of religion.</v>

176
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:10.614
<v Speaker 2>That was George Mason's formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a very liberal fellow when it </v>

177
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 2>came to these questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Madison,</v>

178
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 2>age 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the youngest man in the room says,</v>

179
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 2>I disapprove of this.</v>

180
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.243
<v Speaker 2>I think that toleration implies that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government one knows more than the </v>

181
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 2>individual to is in a supervisory role </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the individual.</v>

182
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>And I think these are both incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

183
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 2>The government should just stay out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

184
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.333
<v Speaker 2>So Madison said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I propose an alternative that we should </v>

185
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 2>say Virginia's are entitled to the Free </v>
<v Speaker 2>Exercise of religion.</v>

186
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.220
<v Speaker 2>And when Mason heard this explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

187
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I endorse this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the committee,</v>

188
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.233
<v Speaker 2>the whole convention voted and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>voted unanimously for Madison is </v>

189
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 2>formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in my book I say,</v>

190
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 2>and this is not a common view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

191
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the most important thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>madison ever did.</v>

192
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 2>He came up with this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>government should,</v>

193
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 2>should not be telling people what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the afterlife,</v>

194
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 2>about religious ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what church to attend.</v>

195
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't say we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerant of you if you're wrong,</v>

196
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to have our own right </v>
<v Speaker 2>views as was going on in England.</v>

197
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.940
<v Speaker 2>And he would of course later be the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>who ensured that this phrase,</v>

198
00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 2>ology free exercise will be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federal constitution.</v>

199
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gave me a lot to work with.</v>

200
00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:23.800
<v Speaker 1>They're so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such an.</v>

201
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It's such an interesting point though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're making,</v>

202
00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:26.824
<v Speaker 1>because we talked so much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance these days and he was saying </v>

203
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:30.281
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

204
00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:30.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

205
00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:31.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance isn't enough.</v>

206
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.150
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need true freedom.</v>

207
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Here was he really worked through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

208
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Mason and everybody heard it and </v>

209
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.210
<v Speaker 1>that quickly or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

210
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.930
<v Speaker 2>they agreed to include it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>declaration of rights and they agreed as</v>

211
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:45.764
<v Speaker 2>soon as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they got to this question of </v>

212
00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:50.960
<v Speaker 2>formulating their own new form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government during the revolution,</v>

213
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.123
<v Speaker 2>they agreed that they would discontinue </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxing people to support the Anglican </v>

214
00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the episcopal church,</v>

215
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:01.700
<v Speaker 2>but it was going to be a long struggle </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have formal this establishment of the</v>

216
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Church of England in Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Madison was central to that too.</v>

217
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.523
<v Speaker 2>He and Jeff Jefferson wrote a bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the Virginia statutes religious </v>

218
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 2>freedom now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he proposed it.</v>

219
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:10.644
<v Speaker 2>It was defeated Madison 10 years later </v>
<v Speaker 2>ensured that an alternative taxing </v>

220
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:16.004
<v Speaker 2>people to support whatever form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity you wanted would be </v>

221
00:11:18.471 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 2>defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he brushed off Jefferson's bill</v>

222
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:22.060
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>

223
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.350
<v Speaker 2>we need to pass this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it happened.</v>

224
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Virginia became the first officially </v>
<v Speaker 2>secular society ever anywhere.</v>

225
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.970
<v Speaker 2>It's really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was 25 when he started this.</v>

226
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.910
<v Speaker 2>So how old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I done?</v>

227
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm 41.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 54 and I've done nothing right.</v>

228
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.610
<v Speaker 2>The Madison came up with this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he had dropped dead when he was 25,</v>

229
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.950
<v Speaker 2>he would still be one of the 10 most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important American.</v>

230
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is incredible,</v>

231
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's such as we're going to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other things.</v>

232
00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:48.970
<v Speaker 1>He did that through line to all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms that we have right now.</v>

233
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.260
<v Speaker 1>You briefly said that we don't know much</v>
<v Speaker 1>about his actual religious beliefs.</v>

234
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Do we know anything actually because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

235
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be this debate these days</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what they want.</v>

236
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Most of the founders actually believed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

237
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:02.224
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about rights from God </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet so many of them obviously </v>

238
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:06.994
<v Speaker 1>Madison but Jefferson included and </v>
<v Speaker 1>others were also so it was so important </v>

239
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.863
<v Speaker 1>to talk about a separation of church and</v>
<v Speaker 1>state where they all just deists do we </v>

240
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>have a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any insight into that?</v>

241
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have information about some people,</v>

242
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 2>but the term founders is very nebulous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by that?</v>

243
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So often people say,</v>

244
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:27.724
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the founders believed this and </v>

245
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about six guys or eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

246
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

247
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.193
<v Speaker 2>my own view is that that term should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood to include people who signed </v>

248
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:37.114
<v Speaker 2>the declaration of independence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were involved in Philadelphia </v>

249
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Convention and writing the constitution </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were in the ratification conventions</v>

250
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:43.324
<v Speaker 2>and agreed to the constitution who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the congress that proposed the bill </v>

251
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.740
<v Speaker 2>of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

252
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 2>who were involved in the debate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether to adopt the bill of rights.</v>

253
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.223
<v Speaker 2>So I use that term far more broadly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you understand the term broadly as </v>

254
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:55.144
<v Speaker 2>I've just been most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most overwhelmingly Americans were very </v>

255
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:58.444
<v Speaker 2>religious in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were evangelical Christians and so </v>

256
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:05.000
<v Speaker 2>they did not have this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 2>to each his own attitude about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that Madison or Jefferson did</v>

258
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.083
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in an interesting way was their </v>

259
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.660
<v Speaker 1>reasoning for church and state to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated.</v>

260
00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Not so much that they were anti religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

261
00:13:16.731 --> 00:13:17.564
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they saw the way religion </v>

262
00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:20.920
<v Speaker 1>was so intertwined with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.500
<v Speaker 1>the monarchy and the government back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>England without.</v>

264
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.493
<v Speaker 1>Was that really the key of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't necessarily an anti religious </v>

265
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:28.450
<v Speaker 1>stance.</v>

266
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't only in England.</v>

267
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Madison wrote a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

268
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pamphlet.</v>

269
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.563
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the seventies and eighties called</v>
<v Speaker 2>memorial and remonstrance against </v>

270
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:36.874
<v Speaker 2>religious assessments and there he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>answering that proposal I mentioned </v>

271
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:41.674
<v Speaker 2>before for having a general tax in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia to support the Christian </v>

272
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 2>congregation of one's choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

273
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:49.144
<v Speaker 2>So Patrick Henry had said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had a decline in morals in </v>

274
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:52.414
<v Speaker 2>Virginia during the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to resuscitate them in one way </v>

275
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:55.744
<v Speaker 2>to have that happen would be to return </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a situation in which people actually </v>

276
00:13:58.841 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 2>go to church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they support a church,</v>

277
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.163
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to say not that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to support the church of England </v>

278
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to choose something.</v>

279
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 2>You have to choose one and designated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Madison in response to this,</v>

280
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.003
<v Speaker 2>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a pamphlet called Memorial </v>

281
00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:14.554
<v Speaker 2>remonstrance against religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>assessments where he argued against </v>

282
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 2>having the government support any </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion at all.</v>

283
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.200
<v Speaker 2>And his grounds for making that argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that this had been a harmful.</v>

284
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 2>A tendency of governments forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

285
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't only in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't only particular time.</v>

286
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.670
<v Speaker 2>He argued that it had been harmful to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people into societies in general,</v>

287
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 2>wherever it had been tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was essentially everywhere.</v>

288
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 2>And he wanted that to stop.</v>

289
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Do we know anything about what they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought this whole crew,</v>

290
00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:47.924
<v Speaker 1>whether you count the founders as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>six to eight or sort of the broader </v>

291
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 1>group that you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they really</v>

292
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 2>realized how important the work they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing was?</v>

293
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

294
00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

295
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.883
<v Speaker 2>although a John Adams in Massachusetts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Thomas Jefferson in Virginia didn't </v>

296
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:05.144
<v Speaker 2>know each other at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each of them when he was very young man </v>

297
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 2>wrote a letter in which he closed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

298
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 2>save this letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are gonna.</v>

299
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Want to read my letters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson was a teenager when he,</v>

300
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.690
<v Speaker 2>when he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the time he died,</v>

301
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.950
<v Speaker 2>68 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 67,</v>

302
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time he died,</v>

303
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 2>he'd saved over 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>documents he'd written and the same John</v>

304
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Adams and attorney writing to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>beloved Abigail Smith.</v>

305
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Later Abigail Adams said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saved this letter.</v>

306
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:36.014
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to read my letters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually people like Jefferson </v>

307
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Madison and Alexander Hamilton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

308
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 2>they saved all their documents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They saved all their notes.</v>

309
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 2>They had the idea that what they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing was really important and they also</v>

310
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:51.280
<v Speaker 2>had the idea that there was inadequate </v>
<v Speaker 2>information about the,</v>

311
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:56.610
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental commitments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions of most other societies.</v>

312
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.300
<v Speaker 2>So they wanted to make a record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just fascinating to think about it.</v>

313
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:01.803
<v Speaker 2>It's truly before the birth of a nation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're doing this in places where </v>

314
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.893
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't tweet at each other or get</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the phone with each other and I </v>

315
00:16:07.991 --> 00:16:09.800
<v Speaker 2>haven't really figured this well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they have been able to tweet,</v>

316
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have written much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

317
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:12.720
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know now,</v>

318
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.093
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel kind of sorry as a historian of </v>

319
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 2>late 18th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19th centuries for people who want</v>

320
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 2>to work on contemporary stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen.</v>

321
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if the law says save all your </v>

322
00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:25.410
<v Speaker 2>emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might find $60,000</v>

323
00:16:25.411 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 2>and just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

324
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:27.764
<v Speaker 2>who knows what happened in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the plan is that nobody will ever </v>

325
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:30.951
<v Speaker 2>read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

326
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the special council found it,</v>

327
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 2>but for most people I have a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just,</v>

328
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.283
<v Speaker 2>just reams of this stuff is trashed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that means future historians have no </v>

329
00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:40.694
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

330
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.983
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have a cascade of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are big libraries full of </v>

331
00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:45.854
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the secret things we'd </v>

332
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.270
<v Speaker 2>actually like to be able to read that </v>
<v Speaker 2>went into their decision making.</v>

333
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.253
<v Speaker 2>They've intentionally wrecked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's such richness to </v>

334
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:54.960
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

335
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.180
<v Speaker 2>hundred year period or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

336
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.370
<v Speaker 2>do we know anything about who the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>formative people were around him?</v>

337
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Who were the other people that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced his ideas?</v>

338
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

339
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.410
<v Speaker 2>there are people he read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a witherspoon is in a place for him,</v>

340
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:12.680
<v Speaker 2>like William Small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a professor at William and Mary,</v>

341
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:13.514
<v Speaker 2>who had the most influence on Jefferson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Madison had particular past </v>

342
00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:21.620
<v Speaker 2>writers who were really influential with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

343
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.783
<v Speaker 2>One was the borrower and a French </v>
<v Speaker 2>political scientist who wrote a book </v>

344
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:27.314
<v Speaker 2>called the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirit of the laws in which he </v>

345
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.284
<v Speaker 2>examined Roman history in British </v>
<v Speaker 2>history and tried to deduce rules of </v>

346
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>political science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Madison carefully considered,</v>

347
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.610
<v Speaker 2>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse writing,</v>

348
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:41.444
<v Speaker 2>and adopted some of it as his own and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then morphed other parts of it so that </v>

349
00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't recognize them as having </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from Montesquieu.</v>

350
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.153
<v Speaker 2>But you can see that the influence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of skin is very significant for </v>

351
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:53.170
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

352
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.400
<v Speaker 2>that's one example there Sir William </v>
<v Speaker 2>Blackstone and who was a leading,</v>

353
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.473
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>English legal thinker was influential </v>

354
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.493
<v Speaker 2>virtually across the spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>American legal and political thought </v>

355
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.050
<v Speaker 2>that Jefferson said negative things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about him,</v>

356
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:08.650
<v Speaker 2>but he was influenced by him anyway.</v>

357
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historians,</v>

358
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Greek and Roman writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 2>if you have little kids reading the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceased to see spot run,</v>

360
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 2>they're going to learn that when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>

361
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:19.194
<v Speaker 2>if you have little kids reading about </v>
<v Speaker 2>cincinnatus and his is a short lived </v>

362
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:25.284
<v Speaker 2>dictatorship in Rome and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a renunciation of dictatorial </v>

363
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:30.330
<v Speaker 2>authority at the end of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to learn that kind of</v>

364
00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:31.164
<v Speaker 2>thing when they're little a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is one reason why I think see </v>

365
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:35.870
<v Speaker 2>spot run is very harmful to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

366
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.923
<v Speaker 2>even if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our youngest children learning </v>

367
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:40.950
<v Speaker 2>to read that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might think,</v>

368
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best way to have the kid come</v>

369
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:43.374
<v Speaker 2>out with a 3000 word vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he gets through he hasn't </v>

370
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 2>learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know anything.</v>

371
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

372
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point was that there are,</v>

373
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.763
<v Speaker 2>there are a few roman historians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek historians when we can see having </v>

374
00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 2>influenced virtually all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

375
00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:00.060
<v Speaker 2>They were all influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

376
00:19:00.061 --> 00:19:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all educated by learning Greek</v>

377
00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 2>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin,</v>

378
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.030
<v Speaker 2>reading the Greek poets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the Roman poets,</v>

379
00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:07.790
<v Speaker 2>reading the Greek historians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman historians,</v>

380
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.903
<v Speaker 2>Greek philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually argue about which Greek </v>

381
00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:12.780
<v Speaker 2>philosophers they like and don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so can you imagine,</v>

382
00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:14.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have a debate between,</v>

383
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.193
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Biden and Mitt Romney over your </v>

384
00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:18.290
<v Speaker 2>favorite Roman historian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

385
00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.383
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just know nowadays people who are </v>

386
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:22.884
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in our supposedly finest </v>

387
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:27.990
<v Speaker 2>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't come out of it knowing much.</v>

388
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

389
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 1>that's why I like asking these questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>

390
00:19:31.501 --> 00:19:32.334
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys really were the thinkers of </v>

391
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:34.794
<v Speaker 1>their time to read all the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>work to become the people they are </v>

392
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.160
<v Speaker 1>versus now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

393
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.083
<v Speaker 2>and it just happened that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the educational establishment of their </v>

394
00:19:44.331 --> 00:19:45.164
<v Speaker 2>time was pumping stuff into their brains</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be not only useful for </v>

395
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:52.880
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also useful to make a man,</v>

396
00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:55.700
<v Speaker 2>a good man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help him decide what good meant,</v>

397
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.160
<v Speaker 2>to help him decide how he might follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>that path.</v>

398
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.750
<v Speaker 2>And today again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

399
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.943
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the education system of which I'm part </v>

400
00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:04.710
<v Speaker 2>is kind of void of this consideration </v>
<v Speaker 2>even</v>

401
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.793
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could probably do a whole show on </v>

402
00:20:07.301 --> 00:20:08.500
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

403
00:20:08.501 --> 00:20:10.720
<v Speaker 1>We talk a lot about the education system</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general here.</v>

404
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.033
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned his wife briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else do we have to know about his </v>

405
00:20:13.121 --> 00:20:16.090
<v Speaker 1>personal life as he's somewhere in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties now,</v>

406
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.070
<v Speaker 1>before we get to all the other stuff?</v>

407
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Madison was slight.</v>

408
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.470
<v Speaker 2>He was reserved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was quiet.</v>

409
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.460
<v Speaker 2>There are various people who met him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said he was unattractive.</v>

410
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.060
<v Speaker 2>He was not good in a group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he ended up in,</v>

411
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.710
<v Speaker 2>when he was in his thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a kind of flirtation,</v>

412
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:35.544
<v Speaker 2>which apparently became serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least on his end with a much younger </v>

413
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:39.980
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

414
00:20:39.981 --> 00:20:40.814
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems from his cryptic statements to </v>

415
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:43.614
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson that maybe he was planning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>engagement and then that fell through </v>

416
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 2>and then later on we all know of Dolly </v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison,</v>

417
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 2>who was a widow whom he ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>marrying.</v>

418
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 2>She had been married and had children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of whom had died.</v>

419
00:20:55.781 --> 00:20:56.614
<v Speaker 2>And then she had a surviving son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two of them were married for very </v>

420
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who saw them together,</v>

421
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 2>so they seem very happy somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never had any offspring,</v>

422
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.283
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess were left to deduce that more </v>

423
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 2>likely than not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was physically incapable,</v>

424
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know that.</v>

425
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any event,</v>

426
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:14.014
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have any fiscal offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the nature of his friendship </v>

427
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:18.360
<v Speaker 2>with Thomas Jefferson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they,</v>

428
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.443
<v Speaker 2>they definitely had a lot in common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was definitely stark </v>

429
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:23.540
<v Speaker 2>differences as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

430
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

431
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.083
<v Speaker 2>they had quite a lot in common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think nowadays it's interesting for </v>

432
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 2>scholars to ponder the extent to which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were divergent.</v>

433
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 2>And I think if either of them recognize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the divergence that was more Madison who</v>

434
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 2>realized that they weren't exactly a </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

435
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:38.853
<v Speaker 2>can we just briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do some of the things that they </v>

436
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:41.490
<v Speaker 2>basically agreed on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

437
00:21:41.491 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Well what did they agree on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they agreed on?</v>

438
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Republicanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They agreed on freedom of conscience.</v>

439
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.460
<v Speaker 2>They agreed that the state and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>church shouldn't be related.</v>

440
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.743
<v Speaker 2>They agreed that in general you'd like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a nowadays what we call a non </v>

441
00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 2>interventionist foreign policy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had all kinds of,</v>

442
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 2>or I should say that the opposite of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>non interventionist foreign policy would</v>

443
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 2>have all kinds of negative political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical,</v>

444
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:05.260
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic consequences.</v>

445
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.363
<v Speaker 2>So both of them agreed where possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay of wars where possible just have </v>

446
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 2>free trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

447
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.400
<v Speaker 2>don't try to jigger your economy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your network of trade relationships to,</v>

448
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 2>to favor yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

449
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.353
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two of them agreed about a monarchy </v>

450
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:26.280
<v Speaker 2>and how harmful it had been over time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and various European countries and that,</v>

451
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.500
<v Speaker 2>that was to be avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are the main things.</v>

452
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:31.300
<v Speaker 2>And I think also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I said before,</v>

453
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Speaker 2>we don't have good proof of Madison's </v>
<v Speaker 2>own religious commitments,</v>

454
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson was one who you may know </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like this who didn't have,</v>

455
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.493
<v Speaker 2>who didn't have any friends who </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreed with him about major </v>

456
00:22:43.751 --> 00:22:44.880
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

457
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:45.963
<v Speaker 2>somebody like Madison or John Marshall </v>
<v Speaker 2>or John Randolph of roanoke or some </v>

458
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:50.674
<v Speaker 2>other contemporaries of theirs had </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends with whom they had market </v>

459
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:55.510
<v Speaker 2>disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Jefferson.</v>

460
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.670
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very much against my ethos.</v>

461
00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're moving.</v>

462
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Speaker 2>So I think the thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

463
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:05.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in so far as Jefferson </v>

464
00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:10.030
<v Speaker 2>understood it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must have been pretty close when it</v>

465
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:13.090
<v Speaker 2>came to these kinds of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what were those divergent?</v>

466
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson was a more radical thinker.</v>

467
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:22.390
<v Speaker 2>He was less trepidatious about trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>the novel,</v>

468
00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:26.740
<v Speaker 2>about overthrowing the established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

469
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.843
<v Speaker 2>he wrote that he thought that every </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution should be void after 19 </v>

470
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

471
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Madison had played the key role in </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing the US Constitution.</v>

472
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.400
<v Speaker 2>He thought had been a near run thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one point he said he thought it was a</v>

473
00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 2>miracle by which he meant it was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>unlikely that you'd end up with any kind</v>

474
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:46.460
<v Speaker 2>of agreement in Philadelphia in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>summer of 17,</v>

475
00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:47.294
<v Speaker 2>87,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone that will be ratified by all </v>

476
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:49.970
<v Speaker 2>13 states within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 2>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he didn't,</v>

478
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.470
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want to try that again.</v>

479
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.833
<v Speaker 2>For Jefferson and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the practical pragmatic question of </v>

480
00:23:59.451 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 2>whether this was feasible was less an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue than,</v>

481
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a good idea?</v>

482
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.893
<v Speaker 2>Is this what we should do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we want to be able to say that you </v>

483
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 2>have literal consent from everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>every once in a while.</v>

484
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 2>And so where did the 19 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

485
00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:15.160
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson had come,</v>

486
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:19.070
<v Speaker 2>had calculated that had a generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was more or less 19 years.</v>

487
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 2>So he thought that if you had an end to </v>
<v Speaker 2>every constitution every 19 years,</v>

488
00:24:22.971 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 2>then every person who lived in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

489
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of a standard,</v>

490
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.653
<v Speaker 2>a lifespan would have least once or </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice when he was involved in agreeing </v>

491
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 2>to a constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeing to a political system.</v>

492
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 2>And in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should live under a political system</v>

493
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 2>to which you had agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nowadays we have the idea that,</v>

494
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

495
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:42.764
<v Speaker 2>society in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans agreed to the US Constitution </v>

496
00:24:45.771 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 2>even though you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't.</v>

497
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess if you're an immigrant,</v>

498
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 2>you have to agree to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

499
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're born here,</v>

500
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:53.144
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that Jefferson thought this was a </v>

501
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:55.244
<v Speaker 2>problem and we want to avoid this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to figure a way around it from </v>

502
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Addison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't talk about that.</v>

503
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 2>This was really hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:04.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's not likely it'll be better if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to remake it.</v>

505
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.833
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

506
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:07.983
<v Speaker 1>he's feeling they're really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we would sort of forget about the </v>

507
00:25:09.961 --> 00:25:10.794
<v Speaker 1>freedoms that we started with and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every generation would kind of forget </v>

508
00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:15.750
<v Speaker 1>and we'd sort of keep wiggling.</v>

509
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was that too,</v>

510
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.150
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said at one point,</v>

511
00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:21.550
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could recall the exact words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said something like,</v>

512
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.670
<v Speaker 2>from the moment the revolution ends will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be on the decline.</v>

513
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.043
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his feeling was that people's </v>

514
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.750
<v Speaker 2>attentiveness to these questions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political legitimacy,</v>

515
00:25:31.751 --> 00:25:32.584
<v Speaker 2>the proper structure of government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extent to which an individual's </v>

516
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.880
<v Speaker 2>humanity ought to be respected by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and society,</v>

517
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.463
<v Speaker 2>the acuteness of people's awareness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things would immediately drop off </v>

518
00:25:45.251 --> 00:25:46.084
<v Speaker 2>and then we'd continue to drop off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how do you prevent that from </v>

519
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.040
<v Speaker 2>ending in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

520
00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:52.490
<v Speaker 2>the people in government pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

521
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Periodically you have a new constitution</v>

522
00:25:55.691 --> 00:25:57.520
<v Speaker 2>to create it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go through the whole process</v>

523
00:25:57.521 --> 00:25:59.050
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going to be involved,</v>

524
00:25:59.051 --> 00:25:59.884
<v Speaker 2>it'll be a hot topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for Madison this is speculative </v>

525
00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:05.950
<v Speaker 2>and wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could have really bad results.</v>

526
00:26:05.951 --> 00:26:06.784
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

527
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I think you can</v>

528
00:26:08.881 --> 00:26:12.060
<v Speaker 1>make probably really strong arguments on</v>
<v Speaker 1>either side of that.</v>

529
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.220
<v Speaker 1>So this must have really been a point </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the two of them.</v>

530
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

531
00:26:14.701 --> 00:26:18.960
<v Speaker 1>they disagreed about it in print and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

532
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So James Madison wrote,</v>

533
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so much stuff that either</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was directly writing,</v>

534
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:28.380
<v Speaker 1>like the federalist papers that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>editing and zillion other things.</v>

535
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Is this a good point to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>federalist papers we need to live up you</v>

536
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:32.684
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else we should lead </v>

537
00:26:33.181 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

538
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Let me just say about them in general </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are highly.</v>

539
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.633
<v Speaker 2>Their influences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Highly exaggerated in the general </v>

540
00:26:39.371 --> 00:26:40.950
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really the.</v>

541
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.823
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I told got a bottle of wine </v>

542
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 2>that's called the federalists Madison's </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture on.</v>

543
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a standard issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a silhouette of Madison.</v>

544
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:52.614
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I is celebrate the person who designed </v>

545
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:56.094
<v Speaker 2>the logo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is among those of us who </v>

546
00:26:58.681 --> 00:26:59.514
<v Speaker 2>are specialists in this area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of consensus that the </v>

547
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:05.760
<v Speaker 2>federalist did not persuade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We cannot prove.</v>

548
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:06.594
<v Speaker 2>We cannot identify one person who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>persuaded to vote yes in a ratification </v>

549
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:13.110
<v Speaker 2>convention because he read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federalist and was persuaded.</v>

550
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.363
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you're kind of taught in </v>

551
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 2>eighth grade and then in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

552
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 2>and then law school if to do that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

553
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:23.424
<v Speaker 2>here are these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are these papers that were used to </v>

554
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 2>go out and get the people to support the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

555
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:28.563
<v Speaker 2>That was their purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know that they did and in </v>

556
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:34.950
<v Speaker 2>fact by the time the last of them was </v>
<v Speaker 2>published,</v>

557
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 2>that is by the time the last of them was</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen by anybody anywhere.</v>

558
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Eight states had already ratified the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>

559
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 2>so clearly our eight states that weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>persuaded by at least those last ones,</v>

560
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.313
<v Speaker 2>and then there were all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some states where none of </v>

561
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:49.194
<v Speaker 2>them were published in any of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers and there was no state other </v>

562
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>than New York where they were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>published besides which in New York.</v>

563
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 2>It was not the federalists that persuade</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to ratify the constitution.</v>

564
00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 2>We know that for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

565
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:03.714
<v Speaker 2>what happened was that by the time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York came around to considering and </v>

566
00:28:06.071 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 2>it okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe people don't know,</v>

567
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 2>but the constitution says in article </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven that the constitution will go into</v>

568
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:13.590
<v Speaker 2>effect among the ratifying states.</v>

569
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.470
<v Speaker 2>As soon as nine states have ratified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there were 13.</v>

570
00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:18.540
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as two thirds of the states </v>
<v Speaker 2>have ratified,</v>

571
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.673
<v Speaker 2>and what that meant was that each state </v>
<v Speaker 2>was supposed to have like a state </v>

572
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:23.784
<v Speaker 2>legislative election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except it would be an election just for </v>

573
00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:28.980
<v Speaker 2>delegates to this convention that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide one question.</v>

574
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Do we agree yes or no to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution?</v>

575
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.820
<v Speaker 2>So by the time New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

576
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.550
<v Speaker 2>met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

577
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were already there.</v>

578
00:28:39.181 --> 00:28:42.120
<v Speaker 2>We're already a eight states that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratified the constitution.</v>

579
00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Then Wild New York convention was </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting New Hampshire.</v>

580
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Ratified that made nine in Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did that,</v>

581
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:51.441
<v Speaker 2>made 10 New York was going to be 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when they had their election in New</v>

582
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.970
<v Speaker 2>York state for delegates to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratification convention,</v>

583
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:54.804
<v Speaker 2>two thirds of them were people who had </v>
<v Speaker 2>promised a vote for me and I'll vote no </v>

584
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.100
<v Speaker 2>in the convention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when they had the convention,</v>

585
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.253
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got word while they're out at that </v>

586
00:29:04.671 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 2>New Hampshire had agreed that made nine.</v>

587
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.073
<v Speaker 2>So now it's going to go into effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they heard Virginia had that made </v>

588
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:10.044
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's really going to go into effect </v>

589
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 2>because George Washington can be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

590
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that leaves us North Carolina and</v>

591
00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

592
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.203
<v Speaker 2>if we stay out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have an independent </v>

593
00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:20.580
<v Speaker 2>country of New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina,</v>

594
00:29:20.581 --> 00:29:21.414
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the federalists from New York </v>

595
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 2>City had a newspaper published an </v>
<v Speaker 2>article that said in case New York votes</v>

596
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 2>no on ratification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York City will succeed from New York</v>

597
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:31.404
<v Speaker 2>state and joined the Union as a state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you'd have the independent </v>

598
00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 2>country of upstate New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at that point the one of the leading</v>

599
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>anti federalists and the convention made</v>
<v Speaker 2>a speech in which he said,</v>

600
00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a choice.</v>

601
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Now we have to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

602
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 2>So notice I didn't mention the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federalist and this whole discussion,</v>

603
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had nothing to do with it.</v>

604
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 2>That's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was going to ask you at before</v>

605
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 2>you started answering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna ask you well with the states</v>

606
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:56.050
<v Speaker 2>that had said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would they have had any recourse.</v>

607
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:58.040
<v Speaker 2>But basically you're saying their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

608
00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.553
<v Speaker 2>Actually by the time George Washington </v>
<v Speaker 2>was inaugurated president in April of </v>

609
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>89,</v>

610
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.400
<v Speaker 2>there were 11 states that are read by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution.</v>

611
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.443
<v Speaker 2>So there were 22 senators that are 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>states represented in the House of </v>

612
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:10.684
<v Speaker 2>Representatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two of the 13 states were independent </v>

613
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina and Rhode Island,</v>

614
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.340
<v Speaker 2>and they were treated as independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

615
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.860
<v Speaker 2>And eventually they talked in Congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

616
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:21.970
<v Speaker 2>The question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

617
00:30:21.971 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 2>what should we do about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island won't join the Union?</v>

618
00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:25.084
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should cut off trade with Rhode</v>
<v Speaker 2>Island and make it a little little dot </v>

619
00:30:27.641 --> 00:30:29.700
<v Speaker 2>on North American map that doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fridge.</v>

620
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At any way.</v>

621
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

622
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:32.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else are we going to do?</v>

623
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:33.274
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island agreed to the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they first had their election </v>

624
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 2>in Rhode Island about instead of having </v>
<v Speaker 2>an election for ratification convention,</v>

625
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>as soon as the Philadelphia convention </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended and said,</v>

626
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:42.574
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you need to ratify the </v>

627
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:44.800
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become a member of the union.</v>

628
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island had a referendum on should </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an election for a convention?</v>

629
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And they voted like 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

630
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.180
<v Speaker 2>we don't even want to vote on whether to</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>

631
00:30:55.181 --> 00:30:56.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just know.</v>

632
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.433
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when they finally got around to </v>

633
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.820
<v Speaker 2>having a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

634
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 2>most people were overwhelmingly opposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

635
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 2>but they finally ended up agreeing to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what else are we going to do?</v>

636
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:07.864
<v Speaker 2>The other 12 states are already in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States and besides that are </v>

637
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:11.164
<v Speaker 2>staying out means they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like creating the judicial </v>

638
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:15.970
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recommending a bill of rights.</v>

639
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.833
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island's got no congressman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not participating in any of </v>

640
00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:20.224
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to end up in the union </v>

641
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they finally joined.</v>

642
00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:23.843
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has nothing to do with the </v>

643
00:31:24.401 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 2>federalist papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still want to get great version of the</v>

644
00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:28.954
<v Speaker 2>federalist papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what have been the argument for </v>

645
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:31.650
<v Speaker 2>people saying no at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

646
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Rhode Island.</v>

647
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

648
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the,</v>

649
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is gonna be hard for people who are</v>

650
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:40.660
<v Speaker 2>listening to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the 18th century,</v>

651
00:31:40.661 --> 00:31:41.494
<v Speaker 2>if you said money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I say money and you think of </v>

652
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 2>an image in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

653
00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what they thought of.</v>

654
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I thought of gold and silver coins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

655
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:49.503
<v Speaker 2>What that's called Specie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they had begun to do in Rhode </v>

656
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Island was print notes Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were called bank notes.</v>

657
00:31:56.501 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 2>We get paper money and a printing.</v>

658
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 2>This notes is just a way to inflate your</v>
<v Speaker 2>way out of debt.</v>

659
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.633
<v Speaker 2>And so there were a lot of debtors in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island who liked this printing </v>

660
00:32:06.431 --> 00:32:07.264
<v Speaker 2>money and getting them out of debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just kept voting for people in </v>

661
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:11.170
<v Speaker 2>the legislature who would do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

662
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:12.004
<v Speaker 2>the constitution said that a state could</v>
<v Speaker 2>not make anything but gold or silver </v>

663
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.340
<v Speaker 2>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>

664
00:32:18.341 --> 00:32:20.110
<v Speaker 2>if you joined the union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep printing money.</v>

665
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island had this paper money party </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was not going to agree to this.</v>

666
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they put it off forever.</v>

667
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:28.323
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

668
00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 2>90 17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 was when they joined the union.</v>

669
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:34.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over a year after Washington was </v>

670
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:37.190
<v Speaker 2>inaugurated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

671
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 2>So I want to do the eighth grade version</v>
<v Speaker 2>has of the federalist papers.</v>

672
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 2>That's why I want to circle back there </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a second.</v>

673
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really fascinating.</v>

674
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think most people know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't have the influence that</v>

675
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:52.460
<v Speaker 2>we now believe them to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the eighth grade version of this,</v>

676
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:53.743
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just trying to get people on </v>

677
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:57.450
<v Speaker 2>board signing the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

678
00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 2>that was the general idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what actually was in there,</v>

679
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.850
<v Speaker 2>was it a real sales pitch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that just really don't know.</v>

680
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a know about the federal?</v>

681
00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Actually the people who you keep saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>the federalist papers,</v>

682
00:33:08.691 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 2>and I keep seeing the federalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the term,</v>

683
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.833
<v Speaker 2>the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the federalists papers was not given to </v>

684
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:16.490
<v Speaker 2>this document until 1961.</v>

685
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Originally it was just called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federalists author was Publius,</v>

686
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.280
<v Speaker 2>which was a pseudonym for John Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Madison and Alexander Hamilton.</v>

687
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wrote different essays.</v>

688
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.730
<v Speaker 2>There are two or three where we think </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably Hamilton cooperative.</v>

689
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

690
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.850
<v Speaker 2>so that was the only thing that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>compilation.</v>

691
00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.470
<v Speaker 2>So they put them all together and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one series under the pseudonym.</v>

692
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Nobody will not make that error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

693
00:33:42.591 --> 00:33:43.424
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of the series was that </v>

694
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton lived in New York and he knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned a few minutes ago,</v>

695
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 2>that they had their election for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratification convention in New York.</v>

696
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:52.844
<v Speaker 2>And two thirds of the people they </v>
<v Speaker 2>elected voted no so or promised to vote </v>

697
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:58.310
<v Speaker 2>no on the convention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do we do about this?</v>

698
00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the Philadelphia Convention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton had been one of three delegates</v>

699
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 2>from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other two left.</v>

700
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:05.474
<v Speaker 2>After a few weeks they gave speeches in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which they explained we were sent here </v>

701
00:34:08.181 --> 00:34:10.490
<v Speaker 2>to propose amendments to the articles of</v>
<v Speaker 2>confederation,</v>

702
00:34:10.491 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 2>not create a new government.</v>

703
00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 2>One of the two who left was the chief </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice of New York.</v>

704
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.673
<v Speaker 2>And when they got home to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the governor of New York was entirely </v>

705
00:34:18.201 --> 00:34:19.040
<v Speaker 2>against this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

706
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:19.874
<v Speaker 2>He agreed with them entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to have a new </v>

707
00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want any of this stuff.</v>

708
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:24.950
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to transfer a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority out of New York.</v>

709
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 2>And so no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're against it.</v>

710
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:30.800
<v Speaker 2>So Hamilton knew that most people in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>

711
00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:35.000
<v Speaker 2>political establishment didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had elections voted against it.</v>

712
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.000
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

713
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.033
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could go directly to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his idea was to have a series of </v>

714
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 2>newspaper essays maybe to get voters to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change their minds.</v>

715
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to persuade the governor </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the chief justice.</v>

716
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.713
<v Speaker 2>They're both definitely set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe through a newspaper series we </v>

717
00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:53.600
<v Speaker 2>could get people to change their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of interesting.</v>

718
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.070
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went to a friend of his name,</v>

719
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:55.904
<v Speaker 2>Gouverneur Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who actually wrote the </v>

720
00:34:56.841 --> 00:35:00.200
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think of the expression,</v>

721
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.333
<v Speaker 2>the actual constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that fancy Henry Gouverneur </v>

722
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.311
<v Speaker 2>Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his handwriting.</v>

723
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:06.950
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the delegates from New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York and Philadelphia Convention,</v>

724
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean from Pennsylvania in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia Convention,</v>

725
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.160
<v Speaker 2>and he wrote the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton asked Morris,</v>

726
00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:13.994
<v Speaker 2>will you please help me write this </v>
<v Speaker 2>series of essays for the papers to </v>

727
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:19.460
<v Speaker 2>persuade New Yorkers is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

728
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:21.830
<v Speaker 2>And Morris said not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't write for newspapers.</v>

729
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.413
<v Speaker 2>So then he went to another friend of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>former congressman named William durer </v>

730
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.580
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you please write some essays?</v>

731
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 2>So Dora wrote three essays that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be in this series in Hamilton,</v>

732
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 2>read them and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now these aren't good enough.</v>

733
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.890
<v Speaker 2>So dual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>republished them as a separate pamphlet.</v>

734
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.240
<v Speaker 2>And then he talked to John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay.</v>

735
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 2>John Jay was actually probably the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous New Yorker at the time,</v>

736
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:43.501
<v Speaker 2>and Jay said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

737
00:35:43.501 --> 00:35:44.334
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

738
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 2>But after he wrote a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got extremely sick.</v>

739
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.983
<v Speaker 2>He was bedridden for weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he ended up writing only five of </v>

740
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:55.260
<v Speaker 2>the 85 essays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now Hamilton's now what?</v>

741
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.210
<v Speaker 2>And it turned out that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

742
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 2>a Virginian congressman who had been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Philadelphia convention,</v>

743
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Madison was back in New York City where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress was meeting.</v>

744
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:06.960
<v Speaker 2>He was a member of Congress too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he asked Madison,</v>

745
00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 2>will you help me write these for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers?</v>

746
00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I got to do something in Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

747
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:11.784
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

748
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.773
<v Speaker 2>So that's why Madison ends up being kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of second most important author of the </v>

749
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:17.290
<v Speaker 2>series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

750
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the series is in my book</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Madison,</v>

751
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.773
<v Speaker 2>James Madison and making America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I devote a lot of space to the </v>

752
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:25.014
<v Speaker 2>federalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because it was important at the </v>

753
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for two reasons.</v>

754
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important now.</v>

755
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.650
<v Speaker 2>People tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even people in Congress,</v>

756
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.170
<v Speaker 2>the presidents of people who are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>federal courts,</v>

757
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 2>they tend to start to answer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

758
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 2>how do you understand the constitution </v>
<v Speaker 2>by saying,</v>

759
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:41.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what federalist 48 says.</v>

760
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one thing,</v>

761
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.490
<v Speaker 2>but another thing is that this is one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important things Madison did.</v>

762
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.533
<v Speaker 2>Even if he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if no one had read them their </v>

763
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:51.530
<v Speaker 2>brilliance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

764
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.373
<v Speaker 2>if you have a painter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you writing a book about a painter and </v>

765
00:36:54.331 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 2>he made a brilliant painting and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw it until last week.</v>

766
00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.170
<v Speaker 2>You'd have a chapter on it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

767
00:37:01.171 --> 00:37:02.004
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting part of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the fact that Madison was as </v>

768
00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:09.440
<v Speaker 2>brilliant political scientists sheds </v>
<v Speaker 2>light on the rest of his career.</v>

769
00:37:09.441 --> 00:37:10.274
<v Speaker 2>He had an extremely important political </v>
<v Speaker 2>career besides his career in the short </v>

770
00:37:13.801 --> 00:37:14.634
<v Speaker 2>lived career as a political scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I paid them a lot of </v>

771
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:20.010
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>

772
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.200
<v Speaker 2>and I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this book about Madison,</v>

773
00:37:22.201 --> 00:37:23.034
<v Speaker 2>partly because we thought is his </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance has been exaggerated in </v>

774
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 2>several ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the federalists didn't,</v>

775
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.550
<v Speaker 2>didn't sell the constitution actually in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the play Hamilton,</v>

776
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.730
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the play Hamilton,</v>

777
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:33.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

778
00:37:33.781 --> 00:37:35.370
<v Speaker 2>you sold it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wrote it,</v>

779
00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:38.340
<v Speaker 2>and all this stuff about Hamilton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also totally exaggerated.</v>

780
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the same thing goes for Hamilton,</v>

781
00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same series.</v>

782
00:37:42.331 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 2>It didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't sell it.</v>

783
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:44.963
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't make people ratify the </v>

784
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:48.210
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two of them.</v>

785
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now that you've changed the lore of</v>

786
00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:51.894
<v Speaker 1>the federalist or the federalist papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what year we're talking </v>

787
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 1>that we're referencing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

788
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about some of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that he drafted.</v>

789
00:37:58.531 --> 00:38:02.490
<v Speaker 1>So he actually did draft the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution and the bill of rights.</v>

790
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.773
<v Speaker 1>I think people are very confused what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually means or how many people </v>

791
00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:07.734
<v Speaker 1>actually did this together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they all sitting in a room where </v>

792
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:14.040
<v Speaker 1>they mailing pieces back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were they sending edits to people?</v>

793
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 1>How did the whole process actually go?</v>

794
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

795
00:38:17.731 --> 00:38:19.750
<v Speaker 2>you mean you want to start with us </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

796
00:38:19.751 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

797
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:25.470
<v Speaker 2>So Madison is often called the father of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution.</v>

798
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I think this is exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did he,</v>

799
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.633
<v Speaker 2>in his own lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people gave him accolades like that and </v>

800
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:33.720
<v Speaker 2>he would always reject them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

801
00:38:33.721 --> 00:38:35.690
<v Speaker 2>at one point he said the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

802
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.730
<v Speaker 2>the constitution was the work of many </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands heads and many hands.</v>

803
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.043
<v Speaker 2>And what he meant by that was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution was largely unlike what he </v>

804
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 2>had proposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

805
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially he had an idea and he wasn't</v>

806
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 2>the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was part of a movement in 17,</v>

807
00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 2>seventies and eighties called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federalists movement,</v>

808
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.293
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of confusing because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have different groups in American </v>

809
00:38:57.161 --> 00:38:59.950
<v Speaker 2>history are called federalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a federalist party,</v>

810
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 2>not the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who were the federalists who were behind</v>

811
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.550
<v Speaker 2>creating the US Constitution.</v>

812
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Who were that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were those original?</v>

813
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

814
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

815
00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:13.630
<v Speaker 2>The Labor Party is the one that congeals</v>
<v Speaker 2>around Alexander Hamilton in 17 counties</v>

816
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.220
<v Speaker 2>over his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

817
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 2>his platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his program,</v>

818
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:19.870
<v Speaker 2>his treasury secretary in the Washington</v>
<v Speaker 2>ministration.</v>

819
00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:20.704
<v Speaker 2>But before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there had been people who wanted to </v>

820
00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:25.330
<v Speaker 2>strengthen the central government in 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies and the eighties.</v>

821
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:29.620
<v Speaker 2>They're called federalists too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have Hamilton,</v>

822
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.453
<v Speaker 2>Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

823
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Richard Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the chief financial expert in the</v>

824
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:34.804
<v Speaker 2>continental congress in the Secretary </v>
<v Speaker 2>for finance of the Confederation </v>

825
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who has to pay for the war,</v>

826
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 2>basically a general Washington was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>federalist.</v>

827
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Various other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally people who were federalists in</v>

828
00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:46.804
<v Speaker 2>this first sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who want to strengthen the </v>

829
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:48.900
<v Speaker 2>central government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>

830
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 2>seventies and eighties had either been </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Congress or they had been officers in</v>

831
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 2>the military or some of them had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>diplomats.</v>

832
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.220
<v Speaker 2>So they saw that during the revolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

833
00:39:57.221 --> 00:40:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I literally had American soldiers who </v>
<v Speaker 2>starved to death in the field,</v>

834
00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.940
<v Speaker 2>went into battle literally without </v>
<v Speaker 2>muskets who,</v>

835
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the winter,</v>

836
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:09.220
<v Speaker 2>didn't have boots and their feet broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bled a,</v>

837
00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:10.480
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have blankets.</v>

838
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:11.503
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were people who were diplomats </v>

839
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 2>like John Jay and Thomas Jefferson who </v>
<v Speaker 2>went overseas and John Jay,</v>

840
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:16.924
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the seventies and eighties when he </v>

841
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:21.220
<v Speaker 2>was American minister to Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up in Spain.</v>

842
00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing he had to ask the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign ministers assistant was,</v>

843
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.950
<v Speaker 2>can you loan me some money so I can buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>some food?</v>

844
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to borrow money.</v>

845
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:31.320
<v Speaker 2>So I can get myself a place to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

846
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 2>so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the federal government had no money.</v>

847
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also,</v>

848
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:39.490
<v Speaker 2>during the revolution it had not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it have to ask Congress for money to</v>

849
00:40:39.491 --> 00:40:40.930
<v Speaker 2>pay for things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it had to ask,</v>

850
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it have to ask the states to pay for</v>

851
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:43.660
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

852
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.720
<v Speaker 2>the congress had to ask the states for </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and always they got less.</v>

853
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 2>They have less money than they had asked</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

854
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 2>They had less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fewer men than they had asked for.</v>

855
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.250
<v Speaker 2>And there were some times when states </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

856
00:40:57.251 --> 00:40:58.450
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not sending anything.</v>

857
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 2>So by the time the Philadelphia </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention met in 17,</v>

858
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:03.004
<v Speaker 2>87,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single state had sometimes sent </v>

859
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:09.520
<v Speaker 2>less than requested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them had sent nothing in some in</v>

860
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:12.040
<v Speaker 2>response to some of these requests from </v>
<v Speaker 2>men or money.</v>

861
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.990
<v Speaker 2>And was there a punishment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can we do?</v>

862
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 2>There was no as if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if today,</v>

863
00:41:17.591 --> 00:41:18.424
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this situation of president </v>

864
00:41:19.931 --> 00:41:20.764
<v Speaker 2>trump made famous in 2016 campaign in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which we have 27 members of NATO and </v>

865
00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:27.730
<v Speaker 2>only five of them meet the two percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of GDP threshold of,</v>

866
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:28.780
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

867
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:29.613
<v Speaker 2>military spending that they have all </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed to what can the other 22 of </v>

868
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 2>including the Americans who pay more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anybody,</v>

869
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:36.163
<v Speaker 2>what can the rest of us do to Germany or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands or Spain for not </v>

870
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:41.400
<v Speaker 2>spending two percent of GDP on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military?</v>

871
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing we can do.</v>

872
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.623
<v Speaker 2>The same thing was going on and actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst a transgressor in this regard </v>

873
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:51.320
<v Speaker 2>was Rhode Island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which repeatedly sent nothing.</v>

874
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.673
<v Speaker 2>And these guys were the real rebels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were scofflaws and actually they </v>

875
00:41:55.281 --> 00:41:56.114
<v Speaker 2>were going to send,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were the only state that didn't </v>

876
00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:58.064
<v Speaker 2>send anybody to the Philadelphia </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention because they didn't want to </v>

877
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:01.670
<v Speaker 2>strengthen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not paying.</v>

878
00:42:01.671 --> 00:42:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Why should we want a straight from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would mean we'd have to pay.</v>

879
00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.140
<v Speaker 2>And they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

880
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.960
<v Speaker 2>what economists call a free rider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They realized that if Massachusetts,</v>

881
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia,</v>

882
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:10.724
<v Speaker 2>we're going to defend themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be defending Rhode </v>

883
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

884
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.930
<v Speaker 2>so why should we pay for this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

885
00:42:15.931 --> 00:42:20.660
<v Speaker 2>so people like Washington who had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>commander and chief of the army and seen</v>

886
00:42:20.661 --> 00:42:21.494
<v Speaker 2>his men in these dire straits in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>field and Madison who had been in </v>

887
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Congress and tried to get money to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

888
00:42:26.271 --> 00:42:29.960
<v Speaker 2>to send to Washington or men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realize this is inadequate.</v>

889
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.873
<v Speaker 2>We have to have something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Madison drafted what's called the </v>

890
00:42:33.471 --> 00:42:34.304
<v Speaker 2>Virginia plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which envisioned a new national </v>

891
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:39.620
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike the one we have now,</v>

892
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 2>unlike the one that was created by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

893
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.560
<v Speaker 2>So people credit him with having written</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution.</v>

894
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.500
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a rough draft that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

895
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of major features were made </v>

896
00:42:51.441 --> 00:42:52.274
<v Speaker 2>part of a new constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many of the major features were </v>

897
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:55.424
<v Speaker 2>rejected over and over in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them met after he repeatedly </v>

898
00:42:58.431 --> 00:42:59.570
<v Speaker 2>brought them up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

899
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 2>when they get to the last week of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia Convention,</v>

900
00:43:01.641 --> 00:43:02.474
<v Speaker 2>they voted on and one of his major pet </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and every single state including </v>

901
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:06.674
<v Speaker 2>Virginia voted no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was not the author of the </v>

902
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

903
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played a very important role,</v>

904
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:13.844
<v Speaker 2>which should be remembered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it makes them look </v>

905
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:18.470
<v Speaker 2>better to make up something that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't actually do.</v>

906
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:19.341
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so interesting.</v>

907
00:43:19.341 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group of federalist,</v>

908
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 2>at the time they were really trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthen the federal government.</v>

909
00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:26.750
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like it really was mostly for </v>
<v Speaker 2>military purposes.</v>

910
00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean you mentioned the main function </v>
<v Speaker 2>for some overseas post.</v>

911
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Well you had to have diplomats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to have a military,</v>

912
00:43:32.711 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 2>you want to have diplomats overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mainly what the diplomats were doing was</v>

913
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 2>trying to get alliances to help fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>the war,</v>

914
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.730
<v Speaker 2>to get foreign countries to loan the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States money.</v>

915
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.630
<v Speaker 2>So it was all one cause essentially it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was about foreign policy.</v>

916
00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what the federal government was </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

917
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:48.650
<v Speaker 2>This is classic federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:43:48.651 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 2>where you have some countries that can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>defend themselves,</v>

919
00:43:51.471 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 2>and so they leave together for mutual </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense.</v>

920
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

921
00:43:55.701 --> 00:43:56.534
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if he wasn't the author of the </v>

922
00:43:57.951 --> 00:44:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Constitution in the way that we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the contributions that we need</v>

923
00:44:02.481 --> 00:44:03.314
<v Speaker 2>to know about?</v>

924
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:04.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first he was one of the main people </v>

925
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 2>behind the fact that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia convention.</v>

926
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.003
<v Speaker 2>So if there ended up being this meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>have delegates from 12 states to talk </v>

927
00:44:13.641 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Speaker 2>about amending the articles of </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederation so that the congress would</v>

928
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:19.070
<v Speaker 2>be able to raise men and money to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.113
<v Speaker 2>send diplomats and raise an army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison was one of the two or three </v>

930
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:26.390
<v Speaker 2>people most responsible for there being </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Philadelphia convention.</v>

931
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:27.693
<v Speaker 2>And then when they got to Philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he persuaded the other Virginia </v>

932
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:33.240
<v Speaker 2>delegates who included some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>prominent men in the country,</v>

933
00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to propose what's called the Virginia </v>

934
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:37.224
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which laid out that there should be </v>

935
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 2>three branches of the federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

936
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.020
<v Speaker 2>that the legislature should be by </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras.</v>

937
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.120
<v Speaker 2>It should have a taxing power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are very important ideas.</v>

938
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:50.960
<v Speaker 2>These are all the ideas that ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it into,</v>

939
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.290
<v Speaker 2>these are some ideas that ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it into the constitution at all.</v>

940
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.110
<v Speaker 2>These are important ideas that made it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the constitution,</v>

941
00:44:58.111 --> 00:44:58.980
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

942
00:44:58.981 --> 00:44:59.814
<v Speaker 2>if we had time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could go through many other ideas of </v>

943
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Madison proposed that were rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

944
00:45:03.871 --> 00:45:04.810
<v Speaker 2>one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

945
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Give me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me one.</v>

946
00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:07.413
<v Speaker 2>One example is madison proposed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be three branches of a new </v>

947
00:45:11.641 --> 00:45:12.474
<v Speaker 2>national government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should have a national legislature </v>

948
00:45:14.141 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 2>and national executive under national </v>
<v Speaker 2>judiciary.</v>

949
00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:18.200
<v Speaker 2>The national legislature should be by </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera.</v>

950
00:45:18.201 --> 00:45:19.034
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So far this sounds like the US </v>

951
00:45:19.621 --> 00:45:20.750
<v Speaker 2>constitution so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

952
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.593
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the lower house shall be elected by </v>

953
00:45:22.381 --> 00:45:23.214
<v Speaker 2>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The upper house shall be elected by the </v>

954
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:25.464
<v Speaker 2>lower house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both houses should be apportioned by </v>

955
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:28.224
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The congress should have a veto overall </v>

956
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.133
<v Speaker 2>state laws that Congress should be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to to legislate about anything they </v>

957
00:45:33.721 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About half of what I just said is not in</v>

958
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the veto overall state laws.</v>

959
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Madison said was his favorite proposal </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

960
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:43.764
<v Speaker 2>and it sounds so counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was essential for the </v>

961
00:45:46.801 --> 00:45:49.500
<v Speaker 2>central government to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Rhode Island,</v>

962
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to print paper money,</v>

963
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 2>no veto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't print paper money.</v>

964
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 2>So that was one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this must've been one of those points</v>

965
00:45:57.541 --> 00:45:59.220
<v Speaker 2>that he and Jefferson had a major </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>

966
00:45:59.221 --> 00:45:59.821
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

967
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson was in France while the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution was being written,</v>

968
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.260
<v Speaker 2>so he only saw it afterward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't have been thrilled.</v>

969
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.453
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of funny because it's good </v>

970
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:13.731
<v Speaker 2>that you asked me this because when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Jefferson received the constitution</v>

971
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:15.114
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Philadelphia convention ends on </v>

972
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 2>September 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>

973
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:18.204
<v Speaker 2>87.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have 11 states signed the </v>

974
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:23.640
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island never showed up,</v>

975
00:46:23.641 --> 00:46:24.474
<v Speaker 2>so they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York couldn't sign because two of </v>

976
00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 2>their three delegates had left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Hamilton signed it,</v>

977
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:29.544
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't vote Yes for New York </v>

978
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.610
<v Speaker 2>because he was only one of three </v>
<v Speaker 2>delegates.</v>

979
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:36.100
<v Speaker 2>So he was not a quorum himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 11 states sign it.</v>

980
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.253
<v Speaker 2>And then Madison waited from September </v>
<v Speaker 2>17th until October 24th to send </v>

981
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:41.874
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson a copy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually two of them are writing each </v>

982
00:46:43.381 --> 00:46:44.214
<v Speaker 2>other all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He waits a month and a week before he </v>

983
00:46:46.051 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 2>sends him a copy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does he wait so long?</v>

984
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two parts of the answer.</v>

985
00:46:49.531 --> 00:46:50.364
<v Speaker 2>One is he's writing a very long letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are hundreds and hundreds of </v>

986
00:46:53.521 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 2>surviving letters between the two of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them over the 50 year friendship.</v>

987
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Very long body of very large body of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of missives,</v>

988
00:47:02.401 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 2>back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he waited a long time.</v>

989
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:07.230
<v Speaker 2>One thing he did was he wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>description of the convention,</v>

990
00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.093
<v Speaker 2>which is several pages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but another thing seems to been he </v>

991
00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:12.540
<v Speaker 2>probably knew that Jefferson wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to like this thing,</v>

992
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.673
<v Speaker 2>so Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time he got Madison's letter </v>

993
00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:16.533
<v Speaker 2>cover letter in copy of the Constitution</v>
<v Speaker 2>has already received it from someone </v>

994
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:20.130
<v Speaker 2>else and then when he read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

995
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 2>he looked at it and he wrote to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend John Adams,</v>

996
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:24.240
<v Speaker 2>who in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson's and France.</v>

997
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.193
<v Speaker 2>Adams is in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jefferson sends Adam's a letter and </v>

998
00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:28.164
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen.</v>

999
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the product of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia Convention?</v>

1000
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I own that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1001
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:32.303
<v Speaker 2>I'm disappointed in the car in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have expected more from the </v>

1002
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 2>people who were in the Philadelphia </v>
<v Speaker 2>Convention.</v>

1003
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:37.744
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether it's more good or </v>

1004
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:39.900
<v Speaker 2>more bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1005
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:40.743
<v Speaker 2>So that's his original response to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when he finally gets it from </v>

1006
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Madison he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1007
00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I liked bicameralism and I liked that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress has a taxing power and I,</v>

1008
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I liked that there was an independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>executive and you have a judiciary,</v>

1009
00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 2>but there are a couple of things I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1010
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 2>One is perpetual eligibility of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

1011
00:47:57.551 --> 00:47:58.384
<v Speaker 2>That's terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>President will be able to make friends </v>

1012
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:01.234
<v Speaker 2>all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll be able to hand out contracts and </v>

1013
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 2>make appointments and pretty soon a </v>
<v Speaker 2>president will serve for life.</v>

1014
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have a term limit.</v>

1015
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 2>He thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second thing was he says there's</v>

1016
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:12.850
<v Speaker 2>no bill of rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then he had madison.</v>

1017
00:48:12.851 --> 00:48:15.370
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the other areas where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a serious disagreement.</v>

1018
00:48:15.371 --> 00:48:16.204
<v Speaker 2>They went back and forth over this </v>
<v Speaker 2>question whether there should be a bill </v>

1019
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 2>of rights and Madison's answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1020
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.391
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1021
00:48:21.391 --> 00:48:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I like the principles you would include </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your bill of rights,</v>

1022
00:48:23.441 --> 00:48:24.880
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1023
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't think a bill of rights really is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to bind anybody.</v>

1024
00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.940
<v Speaker 2>So over time the government will ignore </v>
<v Speaker 2>or violate or in some sense,</v>

1025
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.010
<v Speaker 2>practically void the bill of rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what will people learn from that?</v>

1026
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:36.873
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's better that the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have their insistence on </v>

1027
00:48:39.671 --> 00:48:40.504
<v Speaker 2>particular rights and when they vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should ensure that their </v>

1028
00:48:42.821 --> 00:48:44.510
<v Speaker 2>representatives stand for these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1029
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't want to put them in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>

1030
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.520
<v Speaker 2>and Jefferson says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1031
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true that occasionally that,</v>

1032
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.713
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who hold office will violate the </v>

1033
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:56.020
<v Speaker 2>provisions of bill of rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>

1034
00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.570
<v Speaker 2>it's something you can point to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

1035
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 2>this guy shouldn't be reluctant because </v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1036
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.320
<v Speaker 2>fourth amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he violated it.</v>

1037
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:03.154
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care about it all you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they went back and forth and Madison </v>

1038
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well these,</v>

1039
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Virginia we have a declaration of </v>

1040
00:49:08.141 --> 00:49:08.974
<v Speaker 2>rights and it's ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The legislature violates at Madison and </v>

1041
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson says that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you and I are both complaining about</v>

1042
00:49:14.021 --> 00:49:15.850
<v Speaker 2>it and other people complain about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too and we,</v>

1043
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least we can point to that.</v>

1044
00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson says,</v>

1045
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I think a bill of rights has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>instructive.</v>

1046
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:22.684
<v Speaker 2>It's got an educational function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People maybe they don't think about </v>

1047
00:49:25.841 --> 00:49:28.630
<v Speaker 2>these kinds of questions and if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't mention them to them,</v>

1048
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.740
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might.</v>

1049
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:30.933
<v Speaker 2>They might never come to mind for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have a bill of rights </v>

1050
00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:34.324
<v Speaker 2>listing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular rights that people should be </v>

1051
00:49:35.681 --> 00:49:36.514
<v Speaker 2>able to count on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'll realize that somebody is </v>

1052
00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:39.934
<v Speaker 2>violating one of their important rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll care when otherwise </v>

1053
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 2>they would never notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he says,</v>

1054
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>I think even if only for that a bill of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights was good idea.</v>

1055
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Madison comes back and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1056
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.823
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would take a lot of work and </v>

1057
00:49:51.701 --> 00:49:52.534
<v Speaker 2>probably people are going to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointed if they think that we're </v>

1058
00:49:55.481 --> 00:49:56.314
<v Speaker 2>going to have to amend the Constitution </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jefferson finally you can tell he </v>

1059
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:02.350
<v Speaker 2>gets angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at his answer to that is look,</v>

1060
00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:03.773
<v Speaker 2>Bill of rights is what the people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled to against every government in </v>

1061
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 2>the world general or particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by this point,</v>

1062
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Madison has already gone to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia Convention.</v>

1063
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.260
<v Speaker 2>He's worked through the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention.</v>

1064
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.273
<v Speaker 2>When they got to the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his friend George Mason and his friend </v>

1065
00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Edmund Randolph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both from Virginia ones,</v>

1066
00:50:19.271 --> 00:50:20.104
<v Speaker 2>George the George Mason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leading constitutional thinker in </v>

1067
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:23.794
<v Speaker 2>Virginia and the other one is at Miranda</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the governor of Virginia and former </v>

1068
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 2>attorney general of Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both refused to sign it,</v>

1069
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 2>partly because it didn't have bill of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

1070
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Now was Thomas Jefferson and </v>
<v Speaker 2>corresponding with them,</v>

1071
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.100
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know that he was in and I think</v>

1072
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:39.800
<v Speaker 2>if he had been either here they would've</v>
<v Speaker 2>saved letters.</v>

1073
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is.</v>

1074
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.153
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is Jefferson insisting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this follows on Mason and randolph </v>

1075
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.743
<v Speaker 2>insisting on this and refusing to sign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to kind of imagine madison </v>

1076
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1077
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:52.423
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is that important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think it would have that </v>

1078
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:55.274
<v Speaker 2>much impact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's going to mean that Mason </v>

1079
00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:58.453
<v Speaker 2>Randolph and Jefferson are opposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could mean that we don't get the </v>

1080
00:51:00.951 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 2>thing ratified.</v>

1081
00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 2>So finally he's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree to this.</v>

1082
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1083
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.793
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing you can rightly call Madison </v>

1084
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:09.854
<v Speaker 2>is the author of the bill of rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting to look at the way </v>

1085
00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:13.154
<v Speaker 2>he introduced this in Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go to Congress after he's been </v>

1086
00:51:15.831 --> 00:51:17.680
<v Speaker 2>elected to Congress on the ground that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he put,</v>

1087
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.570
<v Speaker 2>he promised he would seek amendments in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>

1088
00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.970
<v Speaker 2>And then when he finally introduces </v>
<v Speaker 2>these amendments,</v>

1089
00:51:22.971 --> 00:51:24.950
<v Speaker 2>here's how he introduces them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1090
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some men who would otherwise be willed,</v>

1091
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.843
<v Speaker 2>disposed toward our new government are </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to it because it doesn't have a </v>

1092
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:31.964
<v Speaker 2>bill of rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that he says this in his speech in </v>

1093
00:51:33.831 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Congress and I don't think it can hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1094
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.190
<v Speaker 2>So why don't we add these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1095
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:40.203
<v Speaker 2>So he's not persuaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he thinks it's a good political </v>

1096
00:51:42.891 --> 00:51:44.900
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nowadays we think,</v>

1097
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:46.580
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Madison gave us,</v>

1098
00:51:46.581 --> 00:51:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basis of every lawsuit in America.</v>

1099
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:49.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1100
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 2>he grudgingly did this because his </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends wanted him to.</v>

1101
00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:54.860
<v Speaker 2>And he was afraid they would never agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1102
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:57.590
<v Speaker 2>to support the constitution if he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1103
00:51:57.591 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have these.</v>

1104
00:51:58.731 --> 00:51:59.564
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're going to hurt </v>

1105
00:51:59.871 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

1106
00:52:00.921 --> 00:52:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Let's agree to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get,</v>

1107
00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:03.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get people like Randolph and Mason </v>

1108
00:52:03.831 --> 00:52:07.640
<v Speaker 2>and Jefferson to be enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically he was a realist at that.</v>

1109
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:08.503
<v Speaker 2>He was all the time a realist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He in Jefferson kind of Yin and Yang </v>

1110
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:12.750
<v Speaker 2>right once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

1111
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.020
<v Speaker 2>kind of impractical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical,</v>

1112
00:52:15.021 --> 00:52:16.940
<v Speaker 2>philosophical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very,</v>

1113
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:17.833
<v Speaker 2>they're both very bookish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both know you can name 50 books and </v>

1114
00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:21.904
<v Speaker 2>political science in Greek and Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>into English classics and a couple of </v>

1115
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.660
<v Speaker 2>freshmen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both know every page,</v>

1116
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:27.703
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they come out of this entirely </v>

1117
00:52:29.331 --> 00:52:30.164
<v Speaker 2>different and yet they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just very affectionate friends </v>

1118
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:36.230
<v Speaker 2>because they have this common interests </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they both think,</v>

1119
00:52:36.231 --> 00:52:37.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have kind of the same goal.</v>

1120
00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.100
<v Speaker 2>We want Americans to be free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we want to republic,</v>

1121
00:52:40.101 --> 00:52:42.500
<v Speaker 2>we want stability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want prosperity,</v>

1122
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:44.840
<v Speaker 2>we don't want wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot in common.</v>

1123
00:52:44.841 --> 00:52:47.510
<v Speaker 2>But I hope you've already gotten that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very different.</v>

1124
00:52:47.511 --> 00:52:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's fascinating and it's like,</v>

1125
00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:53.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>241 some odd years later,</v>

1126
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.030
<v Speaker 2>the idea that Jefferson was pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>their up.</v>

1127
00:52:56.031 --> 00:52:56.864
<v Speaker 2>We need people to be able to point to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and say that's one thing that </v>

1128
00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:04.460
<v Speaker 2>actually does seem to work the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as everyone watching this knows,</v>

1129
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm constantly yammering about </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech and the first amendment.</v>

1130
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:08.893
<v Speaker 2>We know what the First Amendment is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know the second amendment is the </v>

1131
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:11.474
<v Speaker 2>right to bear arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know the fourth amendment is the </v>

1132
00:53:12.831 --> 00:53:13.670
<v Speaker 2>right to privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1133
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:14.623
<v Speaker 2>so that point really does seem like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that truly translated over </v>

1134
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.740
<v Speaker 2>time and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of had to be dragged into it.</v>

1135
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.960
<v Speaker 2>So they had to be completely had to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragged into it.</v>

1136
00:53:23.961 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also was defeated for election to the</v>

1137
00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:29.244
<v Speaker 2>first US Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because of his having resisted </v>

1138
00:53:33.151 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 2>having a bill of rights in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

1139
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Speaker 2>That's why he ends up in the House of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Representatives.</v>

1140
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 2>So not only are people in Virginia who </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want a new constitution,</v>

1141
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:41.304
<v Speaker 2>they didn't like Madison for having this</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia Convention and the rest of </v>

1142
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:44.424
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also were very skeptical about </v>

1143
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 2>his willingness to amend the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

1144
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:51.510
<v Speaker 2>So they kept him out of the Senate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he ends up being narrowly elected.</v>

1145
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.420
<v Speaker 2>The House of Representatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much</v>

1146
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.680
<v Speaker 1>fighting was there once they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1147
00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.990
<v Speaker 1>well once he conceded the point on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill of rights,</v>

1148
00:53:57.991 --> 00:53:58.824
<v Speaker 1>how much writing was there as to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually was going to be in the bill of </v>

1149
00:54:01.021 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 1>rights?</v>

1150
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People weren't really interested because</v>

1151
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 2>the first congress was completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated by federalists.</v>

1152
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:08.363
<v Speaker 2>So you have most historians now who've </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent a lot of attention on the process </v>

1153
00:54:13.381 --> 00:54:15.630
<v Speaker 2>of creating the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In ratifying it.</v>

1154
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Think probably most voters didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1155
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.433
<v Speaker 2>So if we had time to go through it state</v>
<v Speaker 2>by state and kind of talk about how it </v>

1156
00:54:22.591 --> 00:54:23.424
<v Speaker 2>came to be ratified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I could persuade you that it </v>

1157
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:27.204
<v Speaker 2>seems like most American voters did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>want the constitution it had to do with </v>

1158
00:54:30.781 --> 00:54:31.614
<v Speaker 2>better tactics on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federalists that it ended up being </v>

1159
00:54:33.781 --> 00:54:35.430
<v Speaker 2>agreed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1160
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.303
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1161
00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.840
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there anything that once the bill of</v>

1162
00:54:40.841 --> 00:54:45.220
<v Speaker 1>rights was actually being written that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jefferson and Madison or any of them had</v>

1163
00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.720
<v Speaker 1>read?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this has to be in here,</v>

1164
00:54:46.721 --> 00:54:48.790
<v Speaker 1>but we're not really fighting over any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that?</v>

1165
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:51.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>several estates that had close </v>

1166
00:54:53.041 --> 00:54:56.390
<v Speaker 2>ratification contest with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcements.</v>

1167
00:54:56.391 --> 00:54:59.870
<v Speaker 2>We've ratified since proposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendments.</v>

1168
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.700
<v Speaker 2>So at an early point after five states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1169
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia convention in September 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>

1170
00:55:06.051 --> 00:55:06.884
<v Speaker 2>87,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five states immediately ratified within </v>

1171
00:55:08.991 --> 00:55:12.560
<v Speaker 2>weeks for them were small states like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhode Island that new.</v>

1172
00:55:12.561 --> 00:55:14.360
<v Speaker 2>This is the sweetest table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyday we're equal.</v>

1173
00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.330
<v Speaker 2>We're equal to fill to Virginia and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>

1174
00:55:17.331 --> 00:55:18.740
<v Speaker 2>in the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1175
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:19.603
<v Speaker 2>that means we're going to be heavier </v>
<v Speaker 2>than we ought to be in the electoral </v>

1176
00:55:21.531 --> 00:55:23.210
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means we're going to be having more</v>

1177
00:55:23.211 --> 00:55:24.044
<v Speaker 2>of a voice in choosing presidents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>judges and we better hurry up and agree </v>

1178
00:55:26.271 --> 00:55:27.104
<v Speaker 2>to this same thing happened in Georgia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a couple of other small states </v>

1179
00:55:29.301 --> 00:55:31.190
<v Speaker 2>besides Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an odd case.</v>

1180
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the next state up,</v>

1181
00:55:33.141 --> 00:55:36.890
<v Speaker 2>the first big state that considered this</v>
<v Speaker 2>question was Massachusetts in there.</v>

1182
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.843
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't clear who had more votes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the convention of federalist or anti </v>

1183
00:55:40.371 --> 00:55:40.910
<v Speaker 2>federalists.</v>

1184
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.420
<v Speaker 2>So finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the federalist society that,</v>

1185
00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:42.861
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1186
00:55:42.861 --> 00:55:44.420
<v Speaker 2>we don't really know that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>win here.</v>

1187
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:47.210
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we could say if you will vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this thing,</v>

1188
00:55:47.211 --> 00:55:50.150
<v Speaker 2>we will promise in the first congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>will propose amendments.</v>

1189
00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.330
<v Speaker 2>So this became the kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts strategy.</v>

1190
00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.253
<v Speaker 2>So the later states that had close </v>
<v Speaker 2>contests did the same thing and that's </v>

1191
00:55:57.921 --> 00:55:59.890
<v Speaker 2>what Virginia did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison's thing.</v>

1192
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know whether we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get.</v>

1193
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.353
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get this thing ratified </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Virginia will promise in the first </v>

1194
00:56:04.851 --> 00:56:08.240
<v Speaker 2>congress will propose amendments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why he's doing this right?</v>

1195
00:56:08.241 --> 00:56:11.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not because we liked the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1196
00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.280
<v Speaker 2>several of the states that had these </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>

1197
00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:16.370
<v Speaker 2>convention contests with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcements,</v>

1198
00:56:16.371 --> 00:56:17.204
<v Speaker 2>we've officially ratified the thing per </v>
<v Speaker 2>article seven also sent along here are </v>

1199
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:21.654
<v Speaker 2>our proposed amendments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what Madison did was he took the </v>

1200
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Virginia Declaration of Rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we said earlier,</v>

1201
00:56:26.891 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 2>he helped to write and he took the </v>
<v Speaker 2>English bill of rights from 1689,</v>

1202
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:31.774
<v Speaker 2>which was a kind of a pattern for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the other American declarations of </v>

1203
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:35.674
<v Speaker 2>rights and he took these proposals from </v>
<v Speaker 2>various ratification conventions and </v>

1204
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:42.010
<v Speaker 2>found most of what's now in the bill of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights in those sources.</v>

1205
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as if he kind of made them up.</v>

1206
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:44.623
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eighth amendment comes directly out </v>

1207
00:56:45.941 --> 00:56:46.774
<v Speaker 2>of the Virginia Declaration of Rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which got it directly from the English </v>

1208
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 2>bill of Rights of 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 nine.</v>

1209
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.380
<v Speaker 2>It's word for word the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1210
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The eighth amendment is directly from </v>

1211
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.750
<v Speaker 2>the Virginia Declaration directly from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the English bill of rights.</v>

1212
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.290
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've got obviously a ton here.</v>

1213
00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:02.143
<v Speaker 2>Lead it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.293
<v Speaker 2>his whole life and all the work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>founding the nation that we're governed </v>

1215
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:06.880
<v Speaker 2>by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not done yet though.</v>

1216
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:07.571
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1217
00:57:07.571 --> 00:57:08.404
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk a little bit about his </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidency since we're doing presidents </v>

1218
00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.233
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the most important thing we need </v>

1219
00:57:14.111 --> 00:57:14.711
<v Speaker 2>to know about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1220
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:17.260
<v Speaker 2>this is the worst part of his career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1221
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.800
<v Speaker 2>it's his foreign policy is a debacle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1222
00:57:20.801 --> 00:57:21.634
<v Speaker 2>he had the idea in the early seventies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eighties that America could some </v>

1223
00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 2>extent substitute economic coercion for </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional military,</v>

1224
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calculations in international relations.</v>

1225
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:34.990
<v Speaker 2>So he persuaded Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1226
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:35.441
<v Speaker 2>in Eighteen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1227
00:57:35.441 --> 00:57:36.274
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could adopt an embargo instead of </v>

1228
00:57:37.631 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 2>building up the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising taxes,</v>

1229
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:40.294
<v Speaker 2>buying warships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending American merchant ships off </v>

1230
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:46.120
<v Speaker 2>the coast of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll just tell foreigners,</v>

1231
00:57:46.121 --> 00:57:46.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you won't,</v>

1232
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.440
<v Speaker 2>if you won't treat us right at sea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't trade with you.</v>

1233
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:55.890
<v Speaker 2>This will make them do what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the reason he had this idea was</v>

1234
00:57:56.321 --> 00:57:59.290
<v Speaker 2>because it had worked before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution in 17,</v>

1235
00:57:59.291 --> 00:58:01.030
<v Speaker 2>65,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>

1236
00:58:01.031 --> 00:58:03.130
<v Speaker 2>67,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17 slash 70.</v>

1237
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:06.370
<v Speaker 2>The British past tax laws and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonies boycotted.</v>

1238
00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:08.680
<v Speaker 2>And they repeal the laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so madison thinks,</v>

1239
00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:09.251
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1240
00:58:09.251 --> 00:58:10.084
<v Speaker 2>now we're better able to organize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can be a national boycott will </v>

1241
00:58:12.941 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 2>use the government to keep any Americans</v>
<v Speaker 2>from trading with foreigners.</v>

1242
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 2>They'll do what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem he had an 18,</v>

1243
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 2>12 was there was a world war going on.</v>

1244
00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Napoleon has armies of 3 million men in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the field,</v>

1245
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.770
<v Speaker 2>which today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1246
00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.990
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't sound like much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have 325 million Americans.</v>

1247
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:31.720
<v Speaker 2>3 million is more than we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can have them if we wanted.</v>

1248
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.390
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 18,</v>

1249
00:58:34.391 --> 00:58:36.970
<v Speaker 2>12 francis population was like $25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

1250
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.320
<v Speaker 2>It was the biggest country in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain had like 15 million people,</v>

1251
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 2>3 million men in the army was </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

1252
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And Britain had over 500 warships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1253
00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Main line warships like the dreadnoughts</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the pirates of the Caribbean movies.</v>

1254
00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So America is not going to compete.</v>

1255
00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Madison thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then we shouldn't even try.</v>

1256
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:00.940
<v Speaker 2>We should just say we're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade with you.</v>

1257
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:03.550
<v Speaker 2>And so they tried when he was secretary </v>
<v Speaker 2>of state under Jefferson,</v>

1258
00:59:03.551 --> 00:59:07.660
<v Speaker 2>they tried this boycott idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had no effect at all on the French,</v>

1259
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.553
<v Speaker 2>on the British.</v>
<v Speaker 2>France had complete military control of </v>

1260
00:59:11.861 --> 00:59:16.861
<v Speaker 2>Europe and Britain had complete control </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all the oceans and it was a battle to</v>

1261
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:18.910
<v Speaker 2>the death.</v>

1262
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 2>If the polling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're able to cross channel,</v>

1263
00:59:21.441 --> 00:59:23.050
<v Speaker 2>he would conquer England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1264
00:59:23.051 --> 00:59:24.620
<v Speaker 2>If the British wanted to defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1265
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:27.110
<v Speaker 2>they had to maintain their navy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are they going to do that?</v>

1266
00:59:27.111 --> 00:59:27.944
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way was they were going to continue </v>

1267
00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:34.790
<v Speaker 2>to force people into their navy if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought there were Britain's in American</v>

1268
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:36.043
<v Speaker 2>ships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to force them into the </v>

1269
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:38.143
<v Speaker 2>Royal Navy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing was they weren't </v>

1270
00:59:38.571 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 2>going to let the United States trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>with France.</v>

1271
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:44.210
<v Speaker 2>They weren't gonna let Americans carry </v>
<v Speaker 2>products from British of,</v>

1272
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from French colonies in the Caribbean to</v>

1273
00:59:46.101 --> 00:59:48.350
<v Speaker 2>France or anywhere else in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on the other hand,</v>

1274
00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:49.184
<v Speaker 2>the French policy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to let the Americans </v>

1275
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 2>trade with Europe because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trading with the British.</v>

1276
00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So both neither France nor Britain could</v>

1277
00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:00.044
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could possibly be persuaded to give up </v>

1278
01:00:02.781 --> 01:00:05.150
<v Speaker 2>it's Po,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strategy in this world,</v>

1279
01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:07.520
<v Speaker 2>war with the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was to the death.</v>

1280
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>But what the US government could do was </v>
<v Speaker 2>it can wreck America,</v>

1281
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.840
<v Speaker 2>which is what it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was terrible.</v>

1282
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 2>The war of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 following this boycott.</v>

1283
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:22.580
<v Speaker 2>The boycott was an economic disaster in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States and then comes,</v>

1284
01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:23.870
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to declare war.</v>

1285
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:24.704
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the leading spokesman for </v>

1286
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.433
<v Speaker 2>republicanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old Jeffersonian Thinking was a </v>

1287
01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:33.560
<v Speaker 2>congressman from Virginia named John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Randolph of Roanoke,</v>

1288
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 2>and when this idea of war with Britain </v>
<v Speaker 2>came up,</v>

1289
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.630
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go to war with Britain.</v>

1290
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any warships where we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>no money.</v>

1291
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:43.310
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding?</v>

1292
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>This is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course the.</v>

1293
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 2>The result was they burned down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital.</v>

1294
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:50.150
<v Speaker 2>They burned down the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They burn a library of Congress,</v>

1295
01:00:50.151 --> 01:00:52.250
<v Speaker 2>they bring the war department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They burned the State Department.</v>

1296
01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:53.084
<v Speaker 2>They bring the Treasury Department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just madison has to hop on a </v>

1297
01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 2>horse and ride out of DC.</v>

1298
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.560
<v Speaker 2>This is totally predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not only predictable,</v>

1299
01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:01.394
<v Speaker 2>it was predicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a disaster and the only </v>

1300
01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:04.304
<v Speaker 2>reason it didn't lead to the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States is because the British </v>

1301
01:01:06.801 --> 01:01:08.780
<v Speaker 2>decided it's not really worth the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort.</v>

1302
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:14.510
<v Speaker 2>So at one point the prime minister of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United Kingdom went to the greatest,</v>

1303
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.090
<v Speaker 2>a British general ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Duke of Wellington.</v>

1304
01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:17.924
<v Speaker 2>This was before waterloo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was already the greatest general </v>

1305
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 2>British history and he said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1306
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:23.163
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I give you an army and I send you to </v>

1307
01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:27.020
<v Speaker 2>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Wellington says,</v>

1308
01:01:27.021 --> 01:01:27.854
<v Speaker 2>well then I conquered the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what we're going to stay there </v>

1309
01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 2>going to occupy the country were good as</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1310
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.140
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the prime minister says,</v>

1311
01:01:36.141 --> 01:01:36.591
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1312
01:01:36.591 --> 01:01:41.480
<v Speaker 2>then we'll negotiate a piece so that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just a complete debacle.</v>

1313
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>You could not exaggerate the extent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>which this is a mess.</v>

1314
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.593
<v Speaker 2>The people really didn't know many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who write about Madison though </v>

1315
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:48.920
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1316
01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>this is a pitfall that biographers tend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fall into.</v>

1317
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:52.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing about this guy,</v>

1318
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:55.340
<v Speaker 2>so he's my hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can I say that's good about him?</v>

1319
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing you can say that's good </v>

1320
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:59.060
<v Speaker 2>about Madison is a war president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1321
01:01:59.061 --> 01:01:59.620
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

1322
01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:03.260
<v Speaker 2>His strategy was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He picked totally inept in competent,</v>

1323
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.680
<v Speaker 2>unqualified people to be his war </v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary and he's navy secretary.</v>

1324
01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 2>He just did a terrible job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is as a military leader,</v>

1325
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:15.530
<v Speaker 2>but the one thing you can say about him </v>
<v Speaker 2>is he didn't repress descent.</v>

1326
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:20.780
<v Speaker 2>He didn't jail people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have the army attack a militia</v>

1327
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:22.254
<v Speaker 2>units in states that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by this time openly trading with the </v>

1328
01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:26.274
<v Speaker 2>British.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't put down domestic dissension </v>

1329
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:31.710
<v Speaker 2>the way that Lincoln did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Wilson did,</v>

1330
01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:32.210
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

1331
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't know that.</v>

1332
01:02:33.501 --> 01:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So states we're actually just bucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1333
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1334
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:39.480
<v Speaker 2>In New England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were trading with Canada,</v>

1335
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:40.314
<v Speaker 2>which was part of the British empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the New England was talking about </v>

1336
01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:45.540
<v Speaker 2>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we should declare independence.</v>

1337
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:46.523
<v Speaker 2>There were leading people including a </v>
<v Speaker 2>felony and pickering who was a senator </v>

1338
01:02:49.471 --> 01:02:50.304
<v Speaker 2>by this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had been secretary of state under </v>

1339
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1340
01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 2>new English would be an independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1341
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:56.490
<v Speaker 2>were rightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be aligned with the British,</v>

1342
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:57.324
<v Speaker 2>not with this pro French Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy that Jefferson and Madison have </v>

1343
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.960
<v Speaker 2>wrecked our economy with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for this.</v>

1344
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>So the argument that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1345
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 2>sick of fence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Madison make as well,</v>

1346
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln would have jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>

1347
01:03:13.591 --> 01:03:15.720
<v Speaker 2>he would have wrecked their presses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what he did.</v>

1348
01:03:15.721 --> 01:03:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Or Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would've jail all these people,</v>

1349
01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:19.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have sent the army and shot </v>

1350
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 2>militia units that were resisting </v>
<v Speaker 2>American policy.</v>

1351
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:24.391
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1352
01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:25.490
<v Speaker 2>You can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1353
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.630
<v Speaker 2>The burden of the Capitol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the White House Treasury state,</v>

1354
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:30.620
<v Speaker 2>but at least he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't hang dissenters.</v>

1355
01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

1356
01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a terrible though the again,</v>

1357
01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:34.914
<v Speaker 2>the only reason that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to exist was because Britain </v>

1358
01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:38.000
<v Speaker 2>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

1359
01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not worth the effort that we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

1360
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.181
<v Speaker 2>Wellington's said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1361
01:03:42.181 --> 01:03:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I conquer them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what?</v>

1362
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a great line.</v>

1363
01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the truth.</v>

1364
01:03:47.431 --> 01:03:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Nobody thinks that the then what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks about it.</v>

1365
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My final question for you,</v>

1366
01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean this has been really chock full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1367
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 1>of Info here because we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents week weekend,</v>

1368
01:03:57.691 --> 01:04:02.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing five different presidents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in five different days in the 2018 lens,</v>

1369
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.733
<v Speaker 1>what do you think James Madison's </v>
<v Speaker 1>political outlook would be because it's </v>

1370
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:09.024
<v Speaker 1>interesting they all sort of in the lens</v>
<v Speaker 1>of now they all sort of look like </v>

1371
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians and small government </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1372
01:04:14.071 --> 01:04:14.904
<v Speaker 1>But you have said several things here </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he wanted a stronger federal </v>

1373
01:04:17.551 --> 01:04:18.384
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a kind of tricky question </v>

1374
01:04:20.251 --> 01:04:21.084
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because our parties are so crazy right </v>

1375
01:04:22.111 --> 01:04:22.944
<v Speaker 1>now and everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can give you some sense of </v>

1376
01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:28.050
<v Speaker 1>where he might fall now or what he might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think these days.</v>

1377
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1378
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:29.183
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're all libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Washington or at Hamilton </v>

1379
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:33.500
<v Speaker 2>is a libertarian today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1380
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.733
<v Speaker 2>but I do think people like Jefferson and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison to the extent that you can kind </v>

1381
01:04:38.671 --> 01:04:40.530
<v Speaker 2>of extrapolate from what they thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1382
01:04:40.531 --> 01:04:45.531
<v Speaker 2>which they're a foreboding about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>result of a foreign policy.</v>

1383
01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Like the one we've had has proven </v>
<v Speaker 2>justified.</v>

1384
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.313
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have huge economic distortions </v>

1385
01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:56.600
<v Speaker 2>because of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1386
01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>

1387
01:04:58.441 --> 01:04:59.274
<v Speaker 2>we have a gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a remaking of the nature of our </v>

1388
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:04.194
<v Speaker 2>governments and we have huge diminution </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the role of the average citizen in </v>

1389
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.960
<v Speaker 2>making his own life or shaping his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>community are.</v>

1390
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.160
<v Speaker 2>And so it's turned out kind of the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought it might in that sense.</v>

1391
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.453
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the union has proven </v>

1392
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.390
<v Speaker 2>stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1393
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.960
<v Speaker 2>the main freedoms have been enduring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is somewhat surprising.</v>

1394
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>People thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this had been true,</v>

1395
01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:33.923
<v Speaker 2>republican isn't with short lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there never been a long lasting </v>

1396
01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 2>significant republic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we still have a republic,</v>

1397
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.313
<v Speaker 2>even if it has a lot of the elements </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people like Jefferson and Madison </v>

1398
01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:46.990
<v Speaker 2>and wanted to forestall or prevent it </v>
<v Speaker 2>still republican.</v>

1399
01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:49.420
<v Speaker 2>We have freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have freedom of religion,</v>

1400
01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:53.770
<v Speaker 2>we have input into what the policies </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1401
01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's somewhat attenuated.</v>

1402
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:58.650
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1403
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I think Jefferson would be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointed,</v>

1404
01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:05.140
<v Speaker 2>but Jefferson was disappointed by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time he died,</v>

1405
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 2>but I think he'd be more disappointed </v>
<v Speaker 2>than Madison surely.</v>

1406
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1407
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really interesting takeaway and</v>

1408
01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I think a perfect point edits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thoroughly enjoyed this.</v>

1409
01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.773
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard is acknowledge you just gave me </v>

1410
01:06:16.321 --> 01:06:17.610
<v Speaker 1>a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff I'm going to have</v>

1411

<v Speaker 1>so thank you so much for more of Kevin's</v>
