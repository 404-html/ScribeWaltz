00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.943
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Co founder and president of </v>

2
00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:09.364
<v Speaker 1>environmental progress.org</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a candidate to be the next governor </v>

3
00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>of the great state of California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike shellenberger.</v>

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just having me.</v>

5
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am very jealous of your beard.</v>

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.773
<v Speaker 1>Even the amount of gray here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just added that before I do the </v>

7
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>

8
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just for men usually takes the gray</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

9
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.453
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do the training of the baby boomer </v>

10
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Added some gray in.</v>

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited to talk to you because </v>

12
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I think this is going to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>political discussion,</v>

13
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.340
<v Speaker 1>but also we'll get to some environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I've wanted to touch on and a</v>

14
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>little bit about the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

15
00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:45.424
<v Speaker 1>this highly regulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly tax state that we're in and all </v>

16
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>kinds of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first you live in Berkeley.</v>

17
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.873
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is going on or what's </v>

18
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's become one.</v>

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was once the home for free speech and</v>

20
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 1>real liberalism and it seems like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>become this sort of hysterical,</v>

21
00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>crazy silencing mob up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening?</v>

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean in some ways it's funny because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

23
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:12.214
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be an outlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in some ways it's similar to what's </v>

24
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 2>happening in the rest of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People aren't,</v>

25
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

26
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.923
<v Speaker 2>it's so striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the social media gives </v>

27
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 2>people a lot of confidence in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>reviews.</v>

28
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.394
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot of information available</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them and so people are just not </v>

29
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 2>listening and I find that everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Know,</v>

30
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.973
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley is certainly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been smug for a long time though </v>

31
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 2>in Berkeley we pioneered it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have you seen a change</v>

32
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.263
<v Speaker 1>say in the last five or 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has something actually changed or was </v>

33
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>this all just sort of what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationally?</v>

34
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.463
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I sort of changed my views in </v>

35
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 2>particular of nuclear and dealt with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the backlash against that,</v>

36
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.483
<v Speaker 2>that gave me a different point of view </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the broader kind of culture and the </v>

37
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 2>ways in which people are intolerant to </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to hear it,</v>

38
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.323
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because of my age I think and I </v>

39
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

40
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I had a think tank in Oakland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in Berkeley,</v>

41
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:02.264
<v Speaker 2>but I hadn't really had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction with the students until </v>

42
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 2>recently so I didn't even know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger warnings like into like a couple</v>

43
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 2>of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like what are those?</v>

44
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>So live in Berkeley had a think tank in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oakland.</v>

45
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to think for the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't know,</v>

46
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come from the left,</v>

47
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>the area and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before we get into the nuclear stuff,</v>

48
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your,</v>

49
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your key thing.</v>

50
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Tell me just a little bit about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

51
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>What do I need to know about you before </v>
<v Speaker 1>we get into the meeting?</v>

52
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a gen x or a born 19,</v>

53
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:31.594
<v Speaker 2>71.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raised you in that fear of the Cold War </v>

54
00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 2>as you probably had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 2>saw the day after on television when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in whatever,</v>

56
00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:44.311
<v Speaker 2>12 terrified of nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents were Christian pacifists,</v>

57
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.950
<v Speaker 2>but they also divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was a kid of divorce,</v>

58
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.120
<v Speaker 2>a suburban Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very left wing kid,</v>

59
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had very,</v>

60
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:57.790
<v Speaker 2>my parents were pretty liberal and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved to the bay area after college to</v>

61
00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>work with a left activist group called </v>
<v Speaker 2>global exchange.</v>

62
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:01.954
<v Speaker 2>So it was always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been sort of a man of the </v>

63
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>left and when my views of nuclear in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular change in the environment,</v>

64
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.913
<v Speaker 2>then I sort of was able to kind of start</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give myself permission to rethink </v>

65
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:11.914
<v Speaker 2>other things and not not believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I thought so to speak and to </v>

66
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 2>start to question some of those things.</v>

67
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I thought you'd be a </v>

68
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>perfect guest because what we're about </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about now,</v>

69
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:20.314
<v Speaker 1>your sort of evolution and know you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing against and where are you get </v>

70
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.563
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of fits a lot of sort of where </v>

71
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm at and a lot of what some of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>other guests who have dealt with.</v>

72
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>So tell me as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you woke up to nuclear.</v>

73
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.283
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the sort of base </v>

74
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:37.860
<v Speaker 1>environmental thinking when you just got</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of college and we're working in?</v>

75
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

76
00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:40.184
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had sort of that sort of basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplistic kind of lefty view that all </v>

77
00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:45.764
<v Speaker 2>of the problems in the world due to big </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations and capitalism and that </v>

78
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:51.710
<v Speaker 2>that's what was wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

79
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.160
<v Speaker 2>And I had this picture I think that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people have still,</v>

80
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:55.994
<v Speaker 2>which is that a more beautiful world </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be solar panels on your roof and </v>

81
00:03:58.881 --> 00:04:01.910
<v Speaker 2>electric car in the driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

82
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.240
<v Speaker 2>and we wrote about how to achieve that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the more we were writing about it,</v>

83
00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:06.074
<v Speaker 2>the more we realized the limitations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>solar and wind in particular as energy </v>

84
00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:10.634
<v Speaker 2>sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had a bunch of friends who were </v>

85
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.140
<v Speaker 2>if you're concerned about climate change</v>
<v Speaker 2>and air pollution,</v>

87
00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:18.050
<v Speaker 2>why not nuclear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had to go through a process,</v>

88
00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:21.290
<v Speaker 2>really took several years to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally answered that question and go,</v>

89
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:22.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to have nuclear,</v>

90
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.960
<v Speaker 2>we're going to deal with climate.</v>

91
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before we fully get there,</v>

92
00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:28.440
<v Speaker 1>what are some of the limitations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think most people,</v>

93
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.393
<v Speaker 1>even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you're saying this was a </v>

94
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>couple of years ago for you sure now </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people I think have that idea if we</v>

95
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>just all had solar panels on our roof </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you'll,</v>

96
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.750
<v Speaker 1>if we had more wind turbines and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

97
00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:43.770
<v Speaker 1>then everything actually would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's actually not what you argued.</v>

98
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.903
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's in and my views sort of have </v>

99
00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:47.844
<v Speaker 2>evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the biggest problem that people are </v>

100
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:49.704
<v Speaker 2>aware of is that you only get </v>
<v Speaker 2>electricity out of wind and solar when </v>

101
00:04:52.201 --> 00:04:53.850
<v Speaker 2>the sun is shining and the wind is </v>
<v Speaker 2>blowing.</v>

102
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people kind of go,</v>

103
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:56.454
<v Speaker 2>well maybe there the sun is shining when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wind's not blowing or the way you </v>

104
00:04:58.691 --> 00:04:59.640
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

105
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not really true either.</v>

106
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 2>So you always have to have power plants </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to run at any minute.</v>

107
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually natural gas because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire them up so quickly and people go,</v>

108
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:11.820
<v Speaker 2>what about batteries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Batteries are really expensive.</v>

109
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Just getting enough of them to store the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount electricity you need.</v>

110
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:15.804
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We calculated that if you took all of </v>

111
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:18.324
<v Speaker 2>the batteries in California and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stored all of electricity would have </v>

112
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:22.950
<v Speaker 2>like a couple of hours Max,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:25.410
<v Speaker 2>so and that would be taken all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>batteries out of cars and trucks.</v>

114
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot of that.</v>

115
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.613
<v Speaker 2>A lot of batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.333
<v Speaker 2>I think these batteries are terrible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment and there's another </v>

117
00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:33.144
<v Speaker 2>problem with renewables which is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they take a lot of space because the </v>

118
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 2>sunlight and water and wind are energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>diffuse.</v>

119
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.333
<v Speaker 2>There's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get a lot of wind to get </v>

120
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.763
<v Speaker 2>enough electricity out of them or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to cover a lot of area to get </v>

121
00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:50.250
<v Speaker 2>enough concentrated sunlight to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficient quantities of electricity.</v>

122
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.503
<v Speaker 2>You actually have big land use impacts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the whole point is to save the </v>

123
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:54.924
<v Speaker 2>natural environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up doing things like a lot of </v>

124
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:58.394
<v Speaker 2>desert tortoises in the mojave and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a big waste problem that we </v>

125
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.164
<v Speaker 2>haven't solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both solar panels and batteries contain </v>

126
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.550
<v Speaker 2>high levels of toxic waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

127
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.403
<v Speaker 2>about two to 300 more toxic waste from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same amount of energy in solar </v>

128
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:15.610
<v Speaker 2>panels then is created from nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you kind of.</v>

129
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.543
<v Speaker 2>It's really the big problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>renewables are actually environmental </v>

130
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 2>problems and it also tends to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>more expensive.</v>

131
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.793
<v Speaker 1>Do you think then that there's no place </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them or is there some place like if </v>

132
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.693
<v Speaker 1>if you were to drive from La here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were to drive towards like palm </v>

133
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>springs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are in the hills you see plenty of</v>

134
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.114
<v Speaker 1>wind turbines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously here in la because of the </v>

135
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.544
<v Speaker 1>amount of sunshine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see plenty of people with solar </v>

136
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:36.434
<v Speaker 1>panels on their roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I go to home depot there's </v>

137
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>only five people that try to accost me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get me on panels and all that.</v>

138
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's any place for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

139
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.371
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

140
00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:46.204
<v Speaker 2>And there's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one place for them as in my </v>

141
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:48.070
<v Speaker 2>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

142
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:06:50.441 --> 00:06:51.274
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that solar was traditionally </v>

144
00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:53.464
<v Speaker 2>used for remote applications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so places where you don't have </v>

145
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.720
<v Speaker 2>electrical wire or it doesn't make sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have electrical wire,</v>

146
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.570
<v Speaker 2>their solar panels are really cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies.</v>

147
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:03.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with them.</v>

148
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.443
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something wrong when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are subsidizing the most affluent </v>

149
00:07:07.901 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 2>members of our society to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

150
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.503
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So California has seen our electricity </v>

151
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 2>prices went up 40 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

152
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.290
<v Speaker 2>at a period where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

153
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.143
<v Speaker 2>they went up four times more than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did in the rest of the country over the </v>

154
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:21.004
<v Speaker 2>last seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a big part of that was we were </v>

155
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:25.090
<v Speaker 2>subsidizing people to get solar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wind.</v>

156
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're doing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental work,</v>

157
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:29.410
<v Speaker 2>some r and d perfectly important role </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the government.</v>

158
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.620
<v Speaker 2>That's how we got jet turbines and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the technologies in our iphones.</v>

159
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.560
<v Speaker 2>But when you're kind of constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidizing them,</v>

160
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:37.930
<v Speaker 2>the people that get punished is working </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

161
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.973
<v Speaker 2>middle class people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor people because their electricity </v>

162
00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>prices go up and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that starts to have a,</v>

163
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.340
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concern that a universal concern,</v>

164
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:46.360
<v Speaker 2>whether you're liberal or Conservative,</v>

165
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.213
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to get a little more to that </v>

166
00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:50.530
<v Speaker 1>and government's role in whether that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer will,</v>

167
00:07:50.531 --> 00:07:51.364
<v Speaker 1>we'll show that for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm very much aware of that because </v>

168
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:55.830
<v Speaker 1>even right now is I've looked into it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

169
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that a lot of subsidies have </v>

170
00:07:57.721 --> 00:07:58.554
<v Speaker 1>actually run out in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot that are expiring at the </v>

171
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.463
<v Speaker 1>end of the year and all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

172
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.860
<v Speaker 1>And also just by a function of having </v>
<v Speaker 1>this studio,</v>

173
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see all these lights,</v>

174
00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:10.260
<v Speaker 1>like these lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they burn hot and they suck a ton of,</v>

175
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of electricity.</v>

176
00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:14.460
<v Speaker 1>So my electricity bill is there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are crazy.</v>

177
00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:16.620
<v Speaker 1>So this is something I'm very aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Tony,</v>

178
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.753
<v Speaker 1>tell me when you started realizing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear wasn't the evil thing that </v>

179
00:08:21.031 --> 00:08:22.710
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it had been portrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As</v>

180
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

181
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.113
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I helped to stop a proposed </v>

182
00:08:27.061 --> 00:08:30.450
<v Speaker 2>radioactive waste repository.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually I'm in my late twenties,</v>

183
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.700
<v Speaker 2>but as he got concerned about climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

184
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.490
<v Speaker 2>you started hearing people talk a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more about it.</v>

185
00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I think my views are probably softening </v>
<v Speaker 2>even before I became directly focused on</v>

186
00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:40.494
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it was really a couple of </v>

187
00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:41.664
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was stewart brand who is </v>

188
00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:44.700
<v Speaker 2>sort of the originary Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:08:44.701 --> 00:08:45.534
<v Speaker 2>whole earth catalog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm advisor to Governor Brown in the </v>

190
00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:51.930
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a famous essay in 2005 and then</v>

191
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:52.764
<v Speaker 2>a book in 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the time I read the book in 2009 </v>

192
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>was pretty persuaded because he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>went through all the evidence,</v>

193
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the accidents really.</v>

194
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.343
<v Speaker 2>We're not what people think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The waste is actually the best kind of </v>

195
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 2>waste because there's hardly any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to manage,</v>

196
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 2>never hurts anybody.</v>

197
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.793
<v Speaker 1>What do they do with the waste?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that's what we usually </v>

198
00:09:10.731 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 1>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of the nuclear power plant and the</v>

199
00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:17.420
<v Speaker 1>simpsons and the three items for damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your argument.</v>

200
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

201
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Anything else out there you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing you learn as you go.</v>

202
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waste isn't green and liquid because</v>

203
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.910
<v Speaker 1>it was in the simpsons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how I got my information.</v>

204
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mr Burns was running for governor,</v>

205
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.021
<v Speaker 1>which.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

206
00:09:30.021 --> 00:09:33.110
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit more money than I got,</v>

207
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.270
<v Speaker 2>now what we do with it is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we take it.</v>

209
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.133
<v Speaker 2>You take the spent fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take the fuel rods out of the </v>

210
00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:42.344
<v Speaker 2>nuclear reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cool them in water for a few years </v>

211
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.503
<v Speaker 2>and then we put them in dry cask storage</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there on the site where the plant </v>

212
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:53.960
<v Speaker 2>is from an environmental point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like exactly what you'd want.</v>

213
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:54.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

214
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.980
<v Speaker 2>when you grow up kind of learning about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>

215
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.200
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you learn is that waste </v>
<v Speaker 2>always has to go somewhere,</v>

216
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.063
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't disappear and you have to be </v>

217
00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:06.980
<v Speaker 2>responsible for taking care of the waste</v>
<v Speaker 2>products from our consumption.</v>

218
00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:07.814
<v Speaker 2>So that's nuclear is like the only way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we make electricity that does that </v>

219
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.313
<v Speaker 2>right now we don't have any protections </v>
<v Speaker 2>that solar panels won't just go into </v>

220
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:16.244
<v Speaker 2>landfills and leach toxic chemicals or </v>
<v Speaker 2>be sent to Bangladesh to be torn apart </v>

221
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:20.594
<v Speaker 2>by kids in slums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only nuclear really cares for its </v>

222
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:25.160
<v Speaker 2>waste and it's almost and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical way.</v>

223
00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:25.994
<v Speaker 2>We put them in these big casks and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're right there on basically a </v>

224
00:10:28.371 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 2>couple of basketball courts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

225
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.640
<v Speaker 2>at a given plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

226
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.150
<v Speaker 2>and we kind of look at them and store </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and watch them and people go,</v>

227
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.430
<v Speaker 2>what if they leak or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in these hugely thick cast.</v>

228
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:38.264
<v Speaker 2>But even if they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be able to see it and observe </v>

229
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:41.960
<v Speaker 2>it and there's not really anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead because there's no way.</v>

230
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:47.130
<v Speaker 1>So is there any evidence that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>could really go awry with that as you're</v>

231
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>laying it out as something that's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe?</v>

232
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.633
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence that waste from </v>

233
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:53.990
<v Speaker 2>nuclear energy production has had any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those problems.</v>

234
00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:54.824
<v Speaker 2>People say people point to problems with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the waste that came out of weapons </v>

235
00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.540
<v Speaker 2>production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

236
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.433
<v Speaker 2>that is a very different process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just creating huge amounts of </v>

237
00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:05.180
<v Speaker 2>plutonium and highly enriched uranium </v>
<v Speaker 2>for bombs.</v>

238
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:06.014
<v Speaker 2>And when we were really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you had really big problems even </v>

239
00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:09.164
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like in the middle of World War </v>

240
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.550
<v Speaker 2>II where you're just throwing bodies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>machines to fight this war.</v>

241
00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

242
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.400
<v Speaker 2>it's got an incredibly good track </v>
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>

243
00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:17.234
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will talk about wanting to bury </v>

244
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:20.930
<v Speaker 2>it under the desert in Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My.</v>

245
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:22.400
<v Speaker 2>And I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

246
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.170
<v Speaker 2>like why do you need to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

247
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:25.520
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine where it is,</v>

248
00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:28.880
<v Speaker 2>you just store it and maintain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes up no space.</v>

249
00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't pose any harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

250
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.641
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

251
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:32.474
<v Speaker 2>that's like the one of the chief selling</v>
<v Speaker 2>points of nuclear is the way it manages </v>

252
00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:37.280
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>

253
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they talk about that,</v>

254
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:39.504
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burying it in the desert somewhere </v>

255
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.213
<v Speaker 1>underground or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they talking more about the weapons </v>

256
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:43.704
<v Speaker 1>grade</v>

257
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 2>and about the nuclear energy waste?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to figure it out because I'm</v>

258
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 2>like a bit of a newcomer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

259
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I asked people in the industry,</v>

260
00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:53.080
<v Speaker 2>why do you need to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they kind of go,</v>

261
00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's better because it's better.</v>

262
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people made a lot of money building that</v>

263
00:11:57.941 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 2>big hole in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

264
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 2>From a libertarian point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of go,</v>

265
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:02.194
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of money to be made on </v>

266
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:05.944
<v Speaker 2>these fears that were manufactured and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're used to manipulate people </v>

267
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:10.594
<v Speaker 2>like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in the seventies so that you </v>

268
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:12.934
<v Speaker 2>would think that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between like a bomb going </v>

269
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:16.340
<v Speaker 2>off and the waste and there's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

270
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.920
<v Speaker 2>The waste can't be used in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

271
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.800
<v Speaker 2>so I have to say it's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>I find most frustrating and baffling,</v>

272
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.760
<v Speaker 1>is it also one of those things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

274
00:12:25.761 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I want to tag it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show to,</v>

275
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.173
<v Speaker 1>to really unpack this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really have to have some basic </v>

276
00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:31.664
<v Speaker 1>understanding of how this will work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you even mentioned before that </v>

277
00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:37.340
<v Speaker 1>the different ways between weapons grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>

278
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian use for power,</v>

279
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people have any sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are different things</v>

280
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:43.803
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know a lot about it and the </v>

281
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:48.380
<v Speaker 2>funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm working on a um,</v>

282
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.533
<v Speaker 2>I've got a book that I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing on the history of nuclear and </v>

283
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 2>one of the surprising things is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary folks knew that there was a big</v>

284
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:56.464
<v Speaker 2>difference between nuclear weapons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear power plants from like the mid </v>

285
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.180
<v Speaker 2>fifties to like the mid seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people kind of,</v>

286
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:07.810
<v Speaker 2>in fact the whole people were actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about nuclear power.</v>

287
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Like they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>

288
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:09.934
<v Speaker 2>You mean like this thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible and frightening actually has </v>

289
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 2>this really positive side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

290
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:15.394
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's get some of that positive </v>

291
00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 2>side going because all we hear about is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative stuff.</v>

292
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Speaker 1>This makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born in 76,</v>

293
00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:22.260
<v Speaker 1>so right when that ended probably.</v>

294
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

295
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:24.154
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a three mile island accident occurred </v>

296
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:28.270
<v Speaker 2>and blown way out of proportion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really importantly,</v>

297
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:29.280
<v Speaker 2>China Syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

298
00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:30.114
<v Speaker 2>this anti nuclear movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1979 came out and that really shaped </v>

299
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:33.004
<v Speaker 2>perceptions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they deliberately and you can </v>

300
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:37.144
<v Speaker 2>see what they're doing constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to mix up the two </v>

301
00:13:39.641 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same word,</v>

302
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

303
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.163
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because we have a lot of </v>

304
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:45.754
<v Speaker 2>dangerous things in our society that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually use for positive things were </v>

305
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:54.331
<v Speaker 2>even injecting polio virus into people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>brains to kill cancer particular kind of</v>

306
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:55.390
<v Speaker 2>cancers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

307
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we obviously immunizer we inject our </v>

308
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 2>children with dangerous diseases because</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect them.</v>

309
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:00.694
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're capable of having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>more complex understanding of that </v>

310
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:05.884
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is vested interests and </v>

311
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:10.660
<v Speaker 2>ideological interests in maintaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's fears.</v>

312
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.573
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's sort of two separate things </v>

313
00:14:12.361 --> 00:14:14.880
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one is what the reality is.</v>

314
00:14:14.881 --> 00:14:15.714
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the other where when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about three mile island </v>

315
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.073
<v Speaker 1>Chernobyl or any of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the argument that you're your </v>

316
00:14:20.731 --> 00:14:21.564
<v Speaker 1>best argument when there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually is a disaster in the case </v>

317
00:14:24.721 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 1>of turnover?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're saying three,</v>

318
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.840
<v Speaker 1>not as bad as they hyped it up to me.</v>

319
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:28.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's three serious </v>

320
00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 2>accidents that involve melted reactors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three Mile Island,</v>

321
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Chernobyl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Fukushima,</v>

322
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.180
<v Speaker 2>the worst was Chernobyl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even the worst one killed shockingly</v>

323
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 2>few people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mo basically killed the firefighters who</v>

324
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 2>put out the fire about 50 to date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

325
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>firefighters die putting out fires,</v>

326
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:49.924
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like unique to nuclear </v>

327
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.070
<v Speaker 2>accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were um,</v>

328
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.063
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was about a one percent mortality for </v>

329
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 2>the several thousand people that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>thyroid cancer.</v>

330
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 2>And then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no increase in any other cancers.</v>

331
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 2>So nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing else you would have asked me,</v>

332
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:07.580
<v Speaker 2>just not knowing anything about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I probably would have said,</v>

333
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.443
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably like some sort of even </v>

334
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:11.280
<v Speaker 2>generational thing going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

335
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not.</v>

336
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really the,</v>

337
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.813
<v Speaker 2>the meme that's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one that they even promoted </v>

338
00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 2>it a lot was that somehow they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

339
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:19.244
<v Speaker 2>if you got exposed to radiation than </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids would have some problems and </v>

340
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 2>we don't see that.</v>

341
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

342
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have been like,</v>

343
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Yay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

344
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 2>We discovered that nobody was harmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's celebrate.</v>

345
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 2>But people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

346
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 2>there's got to be something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

347
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:34.514
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is such a different way of making </v>

348
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 2>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what nuclear plants do.</v>

349
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 2>They make heat and it heats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to make electricity.</v>

350
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no smoke,</v>

351
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 2>there's no fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no smoke.</v>

352
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

353
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:50.261
<v Speaker 2>humans have been around for 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and we really evolved and our,</v>

354
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 2>and our prehuman ancestors helped to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make us with fire.</v>

355
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:55.874
<v Speaker 2>So fire is just a central part of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories around the world and a central </v>

356
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:00.584
<v Speaker 2>part of our identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we look at the Greek myths and then </v>

357
00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:05.330
<v Speaker 2>we have this completely different way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>making energy and power and fire.</v>

358
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.620
<v Speaker 2>And I just think I'm not fire energy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and,</v>

359
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 2>and we kind of go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's strange and I think we kind of go,</v>

360
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:13.760
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

361
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course,</v>

362
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:15.824
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get really close to nuclear </v>

363
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 2>reactors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really dangerous,</v>

364
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 2>harmful and you can die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like it's harmless,</v>

365
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think people don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:24.240
<v Speaker 2>when you consider that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

367
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.093
<v Speaker 2>somewhere between five and 7 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people die every year from just </v>

368
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:28.580
<v Speaker 2>breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke and suffering,</v>

369
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:32.090
<v Speaker 2>respiratory illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we just are less scared of smoke</v>

370
00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we should be part of it though,</v>

371
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.494
<v Speaker 2>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about nuclear power </v>

372
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:41.210
<v Speaker 2>and when we related to weapons in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds,</v>

373
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 2>it's become like this thing where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>love disaster movies,</v>

374
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff.</v>

375
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of taken a life unto its </v>
<v Speaker 2>own in a way.</v>

376
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

377
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such an interesting problem because</v>

378
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:53.414
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want so much safety from nuclear </v>

379
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 2>even though it like kills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like basically nobody,</v>

380
00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to like every other way of </v>

381
00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:01.670
<v Speaker 2>making energy mean natural gas pipelines</v>
<v Speaker 2>explode all the time.</v>

382
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Oil Refineries go down and it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

383
00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:04.311
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

384
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 2>you drive your car super fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you smoke cigarettes when you get,</v>

385
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 2>when you drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you drink too much,</v>

386
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do all these risky behaviors and </v>

387
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 2>somehow we don't want any risky behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>from this one.</v>

388
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:14.624
<v Speaker 2>I think it is that association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think something horribly could go </v>

389
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:18.374
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though we've seen horrible things </v>

390
00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:23.170
<v Speaker 2>go wrong with nuclear accidents and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't harm our laney buddy.</v>

391
00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

393
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

394
00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting,</v>

395
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:29.444
<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching one of your earlier </v>

396
00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:30.764
<v Speaker 2>conversations where one of your guests </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about the infantilization of the </v>

397
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

398
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.633
<v Speaker 2>mean here we're rich and comfortable and</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we want like high levels of </v>

399
00:17:38.481 --> 00:17:39.314
<v Speaker 2>safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the other thing that happens as </v>

400
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.283
<v Speaker 2>we've become developed and civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that our fantasies of what could go </v>

401
00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:49.710
<v Speaker 2>wrong get even more crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

402
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just the crazy things that people</v>

403
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 3>thought about with genetically modified </v>
<v Speaker 3>foods,</v>

404
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kind of scenarios that we concoct,</v>

405
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 3>it's different from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is 100 years ago.</v>

406
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.473
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're trying to deal with the </v>

407
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:04.530
<v Speaker 3>cholera epidemic or a polio epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

408
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to fantasize about </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible things going wrong.</v>

409
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 3>You're watching them happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

410
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to remember this story </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally correctly,</v>

411
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 3>so I have a feeling you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean it up.</v>

412
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.060
<v Speaker 3>But I grew up in long island and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a power plant either that was coming</v>

413
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 3>or that they wanted to move her saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian point.</v>

414
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Does that sound right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

415
00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

416
00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 3>insurance they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to build the shore on one.</v>

417
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:25.760
<v Speaker 3>They did finish the Indian point one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

418
00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.200
<v Speaker 3>So I remember just around that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

419
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.093
<v Speaker 3>I think I was maybe around 12 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and I remember hearing about </v>

420
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Speaker 3>it all the time and that's when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>phrase Nimby got in my head,</v>

421
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in my backyard.</v>

422
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.430
<v Speaker 3>And just this endless hysteria that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were talking about that,</v>

423
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all gonna,</v>

424
00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:40.304
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tumor has growing out of our head and </v>

425
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:41.784
<v Speaker 3>all this craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess you're saying there's no </v>

426
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:45.690
<v Speaker 3>evidence for any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

427
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always like those panics that occur</v>

428
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:50.430
<v Speaker 3>and I think you have to consider it as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>panic.</v>

429
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.830
<v Speaker 3>It's always about something else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

430
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

431
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that,</v>

432
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 3>it's not everybody that was equally </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid of nuclear plants,</v>

433
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.413
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a particular people that have </v>

434
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:05.100
<v Speaker 3>particular views of the world and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are suspicious of the government,</v>

435
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 3>suspicious of corporations and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

436
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm suspicious of modern life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

437
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones that were more prone to</v>

438
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:13.794
<v Speaker 3>have those kinds of fears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we see something different on </v>

439
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:17.610
<v Speaker 3>the conservative side of the political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

440
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.540
<v Speaker 3>They have different fears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

441
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

442
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 3>And if they express themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>

443
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

444
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:23.694
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you start having this sort of </v>

445
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:25.884
<v Speaker 3>wake up to nuclear and you're in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty lefty field in the geographic </v>

446
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:32.940
<v Speaker 3>places that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in what kind of pushback did you get?</v>

447
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

448
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean and,</v>

449
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.940
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's continued,</v>

450
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:41.070
<v Speaker 3>although I have to say it's gotten a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

451
00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean we saw one of the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental online magazines just came</v>

452
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 3>out with a long article and supportive </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear.</v>

453
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 3>The I was in a documentary film that </v>
<v Speaker 3>came out of 2013,</v>

454
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.090
<v Speaker 3>so it's been now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

455
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:51.983
<v Speaker 3>five years almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how long these things take </v>

456
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:54.954
<v Speaker 3>for people to kind of calm down and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the evidence and you just get up </v>

457
00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:59.940
<v Speaker 3>every morning and you continue to </v>
<v Speaker 3>advocate and,</v>

458
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.051
<v Speaker 3>and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

459
00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:02.280
<v Speaker 3>facts still matter.</v>

460
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.080
<v Speaker 3>They matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

461
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.220
<v Speaker 3>I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

462
00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:06.990
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you still need time.</v>

463
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.123
<v Speaker 3>There's a way in which facts matter more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than ever because there's so much </v>

464
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:11.700
<v Speaker 3>opinion out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's got an opinion,</v>

465
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:13.080
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real facts.</v>

466
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.011
<v Speaker 3>You kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

467
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:14.844
<v Speaker 3>it's the World Health Organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you think there's a conspiracy </v>

468
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:21.630
<v Speaker 3>involving thousands of scientists to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover up some deaths that occurred?</v>

469
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:22.464
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't really make sense for </v>

470
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:24.804
<v Speaker 3>most people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's obviously a lot of conspiracy </v>

471
00:20:26.131 --> 00:20:26.964
<v Speaker 3>theorists and crazy ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that a lot of people have </v>

472
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:30.504
<v Speaker 3>come around on the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of my former guests had been </v>

473
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 3>progressives that have sort of had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of awakening and then they ended up</v>

474
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 3>being hated by the very people they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

475
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Were you getting that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

476
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.930
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm sure you were getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushback on the intellectual ideas,</v>

477
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.913
<v Speaker 3>but just I just want to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand because I think my audience </v>

478
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 3>is surely attuned to this when you start</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something a little bit different.</v>

479
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.983
<v Speaker 3>I just want to understand sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of hate and push back to you were </v>

480
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:55.820
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

481
00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.830
<v Speaker 3>it was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

482
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of.</v>

483
00:20:58.481 --> 00:21:00.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's important to remind yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of,</v>

484
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.010
<v Speaker 3>not about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

485
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.740
<v Speaker 3>because you've take it personally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

486
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not that kind of a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

487
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:05.501
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

488
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 3>they're just projecting stuff onto you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

489
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most painful stuff was when I had a </v>

490
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:10.623
<v Speaker 3>friend on my facebook page accused me of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being on the take from the nuclear </v>

491
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 3>industry and I was just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look dude,</v>

492
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 3>the friendship is like overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

493
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.010
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't.</v>

494
00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:19.844
<v Speaker 3>And he apologized later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was an interesting interaction </v>

495
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 3>because it was kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

496
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 3>you really kind of let yourself forget </v>
<v Speaker 3>who your friend was,</v>

497
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this kind of,</v>

498
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in the midst of all the Bernie </v>

499
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.343
<v Speaker 3>Sanders stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Bernie was attacking nuclear and he </v>

500
00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:35.320
<v Speaker 3>was a big Bernie guy.</v>

501
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 3>And I just remember being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

502
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:42.080
<v Speaker 3>you're just caught up in something and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually you need to kind of take us,</v>

503
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 3>take a minute and get control and think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what you're saying,</v>

504
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 3>who you're saying it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he apologized for it.</v>

505
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.973
<v Speaker 3>But I was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you do that at like a mass level </v>

506
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 3>where you kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

507
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 3>everyone can be just a deep breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a deep breath.</v>

508
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:56.044
<v Speaker 3>And I love hearing that personal side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it because I think so many people are </v>

509
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:01.020
<v Speaker 3>going through that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily with,</v>

510
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 3>with nuclear power like you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it,</v>

511
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 3>but just with whatever their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>political evolution is.</v>

512
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.753
<v Speaker 3>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about Bernie and this for a </v>

513
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:10.030
<v Speaker 3>little bit because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was campaigning against this.</v>

514
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:10.864
<v Speaker 3>Now if this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the science is as clean as what </v>

515
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 3>you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then why wouldn't the progressive,</v>

516
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lefty guy who's always talking about,</v>

517
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.470
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about and what does he say?</v>

518
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.940
<v Speaker 3>And environmental revolution writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>once a social revolution and a political</v>

519
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:27.820
<v Speaker 3>revolution in environmental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants environmental justice.</v>

520
00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:28.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

521
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.640
<v Speaker 3>But why wouldn't he be for this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very interesting question.</v>

522
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I suspect there's a lot of different</v>

523
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:36.071
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

524
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:38.040
<v Speaker 3>some of it is he's an old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

525
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.770
<v Speaker 3>it was very hard for old people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

526
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.633
<v Speaker 3>It was hard for me to change my mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>about nuclear and I was in my life like </v>

527
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.790
<v Speaker 3>late thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early forties.</v>

528
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.853
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to overcome a whole bunch of </v>

529
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:51.050
<v Speaker 3>associations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

530
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.903
<v Speaker 3>there's basically a picture what a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it gets called environmentalism </v>

531
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

532
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.640
<v Speaker 3>It has more to do with the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>society you want.</v>

533
00:22:57.641 --> 00:22:58.474
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea would be we should have </v>
<v Speaker 3>decentralized food and energy </v>

534
00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:02.680
<v Speaker 3>production.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

535
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:05.350
<v Speaker 3>we're all going to have our own little </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken coop and our own little garden.</v>

536
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.880
<v Speaker 3>I got a solar panel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

537
00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.293
<v Speaker 3>You're a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My kids aren't laying there like 18 </v>

538
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:12.064
<v Speaker 3>weeks right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I can have an egg be one at the end </v>

539
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.250
<v Speaker 3>of this aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

540
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

541
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:18.964
<v Speaker 3>we have a little garden in the back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of money and labor we put </v>

542
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:22.301
<v Speaker 3>into that garden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

543
00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:25.140
<v Speaker 3>each tomato is like $500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

544
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:26.831
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

545
00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:28.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a bit of that fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

546
00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:29.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love working in the garden,</v>

547
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's great to work in the garden.</v>

548
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:33.760
<v Speaker 3>It's great to have fresh eggs and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

549
00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:34.050
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

550
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.410
<v Speaker 3>and for people that can afford it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might want it,</v>

551
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.280
<v Speaker 3>it might be cool to have solar panels </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a variety of different reasons.</v>

552
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that when you kind of get too </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught up in that and you start to think</v>

553
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:45.140
<v Speaker 3>that I'm going to produce all my food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>

554
00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm going to lose all my energy </v>

555
00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:51.380
<v Speaker 3>that way that you really started to lose</v>
<v Speaker 3>touch with kind of a basic understanding</v>

556
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:56.381
<v Speaker 3>of how materials and energy and society </v>
<v Speaker 3>works and you're letting that desire for</v>

557
00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 3>a fantasy to take over.</v>

558
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of what we come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>

559
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:03.590
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's where if you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of get people out of their own life</v>

560
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 3>and their own how they want to live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their backyard to well,</v>

561
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:10.010
<v Speaker 3>how are we gonna you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 7 billion people on earth,</v>

562
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.873
<v Speaker 3>so how are we going to provide food and </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources for everybody that helps to </v>

563
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.163
<v Speaker 3>recontextualize things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the connection there between </v>

564
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.363
<v Speaker 3>or what's the disconnect I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between sort of progressivism and using </v>

565
00:24:21.921 --> 00:24:22.754
<v Speaker 3>nuclear power?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what you're saying is this can </v>

566
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:24.614
<v Speaker 3>bring more energy to people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower cost than a lot of the other </v>

567
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:28.154
<v Speaker 3>things that we're using it as a safer </v>
<v Speaker 3>level and it seems to me that even </v>

568
00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:31.461
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

569
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:32.294
<v Speaker 3>Bernie is an old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like this is something he </v>

570
00:24:33.951 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 3>should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should,</v>

571
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.610
<v Speaker 3>should have come around on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm still missing that disconnect.</v>

572
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we just don't know.</v>

573
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more.</v>

574
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:41.343
<v Speaker 3>Or is there something about the way the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lefties with environmentalism that's so </v>

575
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 3>connected now to solar and wind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that?</v>

576
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.633
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's funny because it all actually </v>

577
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:51.224
<v Speaker 3>happened here in California and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the difference between our current </v>

578
00:24:53.811 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 3>governor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Brown and his dad.</v>

579
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.923
<v Speaker 3>His Dad was governor and he was what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the Democratic Party that I kind of </v>

580
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.380
<v Speaker 3>was raised on as the kids are the party </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people,</v>

581
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a party for the working man,</v>

582
00:25:05.641 --> 00:25:08.240
<v Speaker 3>the working family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone gets a high wage.</v>

583
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:11.590
<v Speaker 3>You build highways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture factories.</v>

584
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sixties occur.</v>

585
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 3>His son gets elected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry for the first time,</v>

586
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.740
<v Speaker 3>1974,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes part 1975.</v>

587
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:19.850
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>

588
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 3>he's interviewed by William F Buckley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

589
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all have to do with less.</v>

590
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.330
<v Speaker 3>We need to have less material </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumption.</v>

591
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.163
<v Speaker 3>We have to obey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Limits was a striking thing to be to </v>

592
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:34.040
<v Speaker 3>hear from not just who he was as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrat,</v>

593
00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 3>as someone that was up for everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>prospering,</v>

594
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:37.693
<v Speaker 3>but it was also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the wealthiest families in </v>

595
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:40.604
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They owned a huge oil monopoly from the </v>

596
00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:44.114
<v Speaker 3>Indonesian military dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who was the one who were the people </v>

597
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 3>that were promoting this idea of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with less?</v>

598
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 3>It was the wealthiest members of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

599
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 3>It was often kids that inherited family </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth.</v>

600
00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:58.930
<v Speaker 3>They had land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the most surprising things</v>

601
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.550
<v Speaker 3>running for governor as I learned more </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the state,</v>

602
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.443
<v Speaker 3>is our housing crisis is a direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that same worldview that </v>

603
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:11.120
<v Speaker 3>took over left liberal politics in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>

604
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:11.983
<v Speaker 3>Before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea was there should be abundant </v>

605
00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 3>housing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People should be able to buy a home.</v>

606
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.270
<v Speaker 3>And home ownership was really very </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive,</v>

607
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.133
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because homeowners have so much wealth </v>

608
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.920
<v Speaker 3>in their homes and progressive's wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to promote that.</v>

609
00:26:24.921 --> 00:26:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Well Jerry Brown gets in and his anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>

610
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so called environmentalists get in there</v>

611
00:26:30.321 --> 00:26:33.620
<v Speaker 3>and they seek to restrict homes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>housing,</v>

612
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 3>consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy and it was almost like,</v>

613
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:39.440
<v Speaker 3>it was like almost the opposite of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>came before it.</v>

614
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.333
<v Speaker 3>So you're telling me that first term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jerry Brown is the guy I have to blame </v>

615
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 3>for the mortgage that I'm going to be</v>

616
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.570
<v Speaker 1>paying for the rest of my life on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

617
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

618
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:47.634
<v Speaker 2>and really the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's now sort of four terms when </v>

619
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:50.724
<v Speaker 2>he leaves office at the end of this year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right at the beginning of next year </v>

620
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

621
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.120
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

622
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.060
<v Speaker 2>and it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of go,</v>

623
00:26:57.061 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 2>well then why did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was jerry like that?</v>

624
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's where in my book I kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

625
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.823
<v Speaker 2>you kind of are like searching for it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you just kinda get to a </v>

626
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:09.561
<v Speaker 2>backlash against basic progressive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal lists.</v>

627
00:27:09.641 --> 00:27:11.110
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's the funny thing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

628
00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 2>There's a backlash against making </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperity for all.</v>

629
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want everybody to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperity.</v>

630
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:18.670
<v Speaker 2>They want it to really kick away the </v>
<v Speaker 2>latter.</v>

631
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 2>And kind of protect all of it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

632
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's so interesting.</v>

633
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:24.550
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying basically in 75 he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

634
00:27:24.551 --> 00:27:25.810
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

635
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.793
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't really mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he may know because oil guys and </v>

636
00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:30.514
<v Speaker 1>obviously the guys had a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>and power for a long time through his </v>

637
00:27:33.221 --> 00:27:34.054
<v Speaker 1>family because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still around 30 some odd years </v>

638
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:36.880
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

639
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk a lot more about what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you want to be governor.</v>

640
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:40.863
<v Speaker 1>But one other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you read that book right there by </v>

641
00:27:42.941 --> 00:27:43.774
<v Speaker 1>any chance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

642
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.150
<v Speaker 1>And I know Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a coffee with them.</v>

643
00:27:46.151 --> 00:27:46.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

644
00:27:46.691 --> 00:27:47.221
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

645
00:27:47.221 --> 00:27:49.130
<v Speaker 1>so Alex Epstein I had him on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

646
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:49.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

647
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.733
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moral case for fossil fuels is the </v>

648
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:56.740
<v Speaker 1>book I hit him on probably about two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

649
00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I've ever gotten more</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate for an interview then.</v>

650
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:02.403
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had plenty of controversial people </v>

651
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:04.363
<v Speaker 1>on here that I then get lumped in with </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people think I endorse all their </v>

652
00:28:06.881 --> 00:28:09.040
<v Speaker 1>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which obviously is nonsensical,</v>

653
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.240
<v Speaker 1>but I truly think I got the most hate I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever got for having this guy.</v>

654
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.143
<v Speaker 1>Now he's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his basic argument is the title of the </v>

655
00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:16.114
<v Speaker 1>book and he's just saying the most you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do for humans now is to still use </v>

656
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:21.123
<v Speaker 1>fossil fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious where you fall on that </v>

657
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

658
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I think he gets it half right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

659
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:29.710
<v Speaker 2>my view is that it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

660
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.150
<v Speaker 2>my view is very simple in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

661
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.083
<v Speaker 2>I think people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think now that I know more about </v>

662
00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Speaker 2>housing and schools and other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

663
00:28:37.021 --> 00:28:38.760
<v Speaker 2>well that's really complicated stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but energy,</v>

664
00:28:38.761 --> 00:28:39.594
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most of us start off in societies </v>

665
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 2>using wood and Dung as our primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

666
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Anything is better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including burning coal,</v>

667
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's terrible.</v>

668
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 2>You breathe the smoke and and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Labor involved,</v>

669
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:52.584
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you get electricity from coal </v>

670
00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 2>and hydroelectric dams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the first in poor countries.</v>

671
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:56.784
<v Speaker 2>Get so it was really a moral case for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for coal and hydro if all you're using </v>

672
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:01.824
<v Speaker 2>is wouldn't dung,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I also think there's a moral </v>

673
00:29:03.271 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 2>case for using cleaner burning fuels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like natural gas and uranium.</v>

674
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

675
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.220
<v Speaker 2>so he wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

676
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:12.054
<v Speaker 2>Alex did a good job with this book in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sense that he wanted to start a </v>

677
00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 2>conversation about why or when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped poor countries from using fossil</v>

678
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:19.080
<v Speaker 2>fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really unethical.</v>

679
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you should go the other step</v>

680
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:21.751
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

681
00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't worry about climate,</v>

682
00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:24.534
<v Speaker 2>there's air pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other impacts of fossil energy </v>

683
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:27.204
<v Speaker 2>use and if we've got this fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative and usually we go from coal </v>

684
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:34.740
<v Speaker 2>to natural gas and then to uranium than </v>
<v Speaker 2>we should keep going,</v>

685
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's energy transitions and these energy</v>

686
00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:39.660
<v Speaker 2>transitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't want to get too much of my</v>

687
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:41.650
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these energy a little bit.</v>

688
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I do energy transitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

689
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go from horse and Buggy to </v>

690
00:29:48.331 --> 00:29:49.164
<v Speaker 2>internal combustion engines and trains </v>
<v Speaker 2>are what drives those transitions from </v>

691
00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:56.280
<v Speaker 2>energy sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go from wood and dung to coal and</v>

692
00:29:56.281 --> 00:29:59.270
<v Speaker 2>partly because of trains but also </v>
<v Speaker 2>factories and whatnot.</v>

693
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I think you eventually get to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>electric powered world electric cars,</v>

694
00:30:03.481 --> 00:30:05.130
<v Speaker 2>electric heating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

695
00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.300
<v Speaker 2>as we move towards nuclear.</v>

696
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've hit than solar.</v>

697
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:11.650
<v Speaker 1>We pit when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do two of the others.</v>

698
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:13.380
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned one of them right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

699
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.403
<v Speaker 1>so let's just talk about natural gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we need to know about natural </v>

700
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:17.824
<v Speaker 1>gas generally?</v>

701
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:18.571
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

702
00:30:18.571 --> 00:30:20.880
<v Speaker 2>the first thing to know is that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like on so many of the things,</v>

703
00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Americans are just the luckiest people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

704
00:30:22.861 --> 00:30:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have so much oil and gas.</v>

705
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.853
<v Speaker 2>It's just incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a huge amount of our wealth in the </v>

706
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.510
<v Speaker 2>last decade came from this fracking </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>

707
00:30:30.511 --> 00:30:32.910
<v Speaker 2>which of course environmental supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate,</v>

708
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.920
<v Speaker 2>although in many ways they really like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

709
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.810
<v Speaker 1>That was going to be my second one to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask you,</v>

710
00:30:36.811 --> 00:30:38.910
<v Speaker 1>but I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really asking the same question,</v>

711
00:30:38.911 --> 00:30:39.744
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

712
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

713
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two things I think are </v>

714
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:43.674
<v Speaker 2>important to know about natural gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is that it's just way better </v>

715
00:30:45.481 --> 00:30:46.314
<v Speaker 2>than coal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we went and looked at all the </v>

716
00:30:47.491 --> 00:30:50.790
<v Speaker 2>scientific peer reviewed research and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just on every measure.</v>

717
00:30:50.791 --> 00:30:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Water use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>water pollution,</v>

718
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.050
<v Speaker 2>air pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon emissions,</v>

719
00:30:55.051 --> 00:30:56.850
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gas is just better than coal.</v>

720
00:30:56.851 --> 00:30:57.511
<v Speaker 2>Of course it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

721
00:30:57.511 --> 00:30:59.360
<v Speaker 2>You're using your kitchen and it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

722
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:01.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean still explode sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cultural,</v>

723
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.520
<v Speaker 2>they want to talk to you about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploding.</v>

724
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

725
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.190
<v Speaker 2>and it's not as good as uranium which we</v>
<v Speaker 2>use for nuclear.</v>

726
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>similarly on all the same metrics,</v>

727
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.700
<v Speaker 2>uranium performance better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a way in which I just kind of</v>

728
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.370
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

729
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.263
<v Speaker 2>this is just basic energy density.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This basic physical facts about these </v>

730
00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:23.640
<v Speaker 2>fuels makes there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a progression exist wood to coal,</v>

731
00:31:23.641 --> 00:31:25.110
<v Speaker 2>to oil to natural gas.</v>

732
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.410
<v Speaker 2>You rainium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

733
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important to know,</v>

734
00:31:28.201 --> 00:31:29.034
<v Speaker 2>and I think one of the challenges I </v>
<v Speaker 2>often make to my libertarian friends is </v>

735
00:31:31.501 --> 00:31:32.334
<v Speaker 2>that the government played a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive role in all of these energy </v>

736
00:31:35.131 --> 00:31:36.500
<v Speaker 2>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

737
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe with the exception of,</v>

738
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of coal,</v>

739
00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:41.940
<v Speaker 2>although there's a little bit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really,</v>

740
00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:43.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil and gas,</v>

741
00:31:43.081 --> 00:31:47.850
<v Speaker 2>the US government has constantly been </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting r and d nuclear came out of a</v>

742
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.650
<v Speaker 2>military weapons program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

743
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that,</v>

744
00:31:51.451 --> 00:31:52.284
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about these energy </v>

745
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:53.454
<v Speaker 2>transitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is a role for government </v>

746
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.853
<v Speaker 2>because there is a public benefit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of moving towards cleaner fuels </v>

747
00:31:57.901 --> 00:31:59.910
<v Speaker 2>and also faster and better </v>
<v Speaker 2>transportation.</v>

748
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just do fracking because every </v>

749
00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:05.230
<v Speaker 1>time you say fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think of,</v>

750
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fire coming out of their faucet.</v>

751
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.760
<v Speaker 1>They think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make another simpsons reference.</v>

752
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:10.594
<v Speaker 1>They think of burns is slant oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>drilling company that almost destroyed </v>

753
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:15.340
<v Speaker 1>springfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what fracking?</v>

754
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

755
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing is the sort of famous a </v>

756
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.380
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous a water faucet on fire scene.</v>

757
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.933
<v Speaker 2>We now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we now think came from a much </v>

758
00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:28.420
<v Speaker 2>older natural gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

759
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not from fracking and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fracking itself is just breaking</v>

760
00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:35.014
<v Speaker 2>up the Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shale rock and allowing the gas to </v>

761
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:38.464
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the stuff that you would </v>

762
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>worry about</v>

763
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 3>if you cared about the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you worry about is the disposal of</v>

764
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:46.450
<v Speaker 3>the water and the sealing of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

765
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the pipes where the gas comes out.</v>

766
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.443
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the thing is people tend to worry </v>

767
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:52.454
<v Speaker 3>about or think about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you just got tied up with the </v>

768
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:55.850
<v Speaker 3>word fracking as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sounds like a bad word,</v>

769
00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.860
<v Speaker 3>but the funny thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

770
00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:01.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coal has actually gotten cleaner over </v>

771
00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:03.794
<v Speaker 3>the years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Natural gas has gotten cleaner over the </v>

772
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.350
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oil burning cars,</v>

773
00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:08.560
<v Speaker 3>everything is cleaner and better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

774
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 3>but never as good as that next cleaner </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy source.</v>

775
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:11.983
<v Speaker 3>So the better way to think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as we get caught up in like how </v>

776
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:15.284
<v Speaker 3>do you get the gas and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to have some protection of the </v>

777
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:19.154
<v Speaker 3>environment and the public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really the main event is to move </v>

778
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:24.530
<v Speaker 3>from these dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your energy sources to cleaner ones.</v>

779
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's talk about your campaign for </v>

780
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:29.540
<v Speaker 3>governor of the Great State of </v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

781
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.370
<v Speaker 3>You were a lifetime Democrat and as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

782
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.900
<v Speaker 3>your parents were progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left these liberals.</v>

783
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're running as an independent.</v>

784
00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm running as a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

785
00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:41.570
<v Speaker 3>you are running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did change.</v>

786
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:44.070
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dodo.</v>

787
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.043
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

788
00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:46.743
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I announced I saw some resident </v>

789
00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.213
<v Speaker 3>dependent and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was and am frustrated and upset </v>

790
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.120
<v Speaker 3>with the Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

791
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:55.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

792
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I was raised like this was like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>party of the people.</v>

793
00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.873
<v Speaker 3>That was what my parents taught me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I believed and it has been </v>

794
00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:02.924
<v Speaker 3>completely taken over by basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>landlords and energy companies and </v>

795
00:34:06.951 --> 00:34:11.120
<v Speaker 3>special interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in California and things have gotten</v>

796
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 3>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not better.</v>

797
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Highest poverty rate in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest taxes.</v>

798
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Those two things aren't supposed to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

799
00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Those were supposed to go the other way.</v>

800
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.883
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to have the highest </v>

801
00:34:19.371 --> 00:34:21.080
<v Speaker 3>taxes then you should have of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts,</v>

802
00:34:21.081 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 3>levels of poverty and if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the highest levels of poverty,</v>

803
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:25.420
<v Speaker 3>then you just have like no tax or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

804
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.263
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So something's really wrong with the </v>

805
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.520
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

806
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit like going from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>scene,</v>

807
00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:32.564
<v Speaker 3>from the abyss when Ed Harris takes his </v>
<v Speaker 3>ring off and he like throws it in the </v>

808
00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:37.190
<v Speaker 3>toilet because he's so upset with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>

809
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:38.990
<v Speaker 3>I felt a little bit like that at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party.</v>

810
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 3>It was like just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

811
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 3>and then I kind of fished it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>toilet,</v>

812
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it back on my hand.</v>

813
00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:44.451
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

814
00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only do I have to,</v>

815
00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>become governor,</v>

816
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:51.590
<v Speaker 3>we also have to clean up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislature.</v>

817
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:52.424
<v Speaker 3>You have to get a serious reformers in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've got to reform the Democratic </v>

818
00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Party because it's just not responsive </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the people.</v>

819
00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Maybe abyss reference in politics is </v>
<v Speaker 3>works for me.</v>

820
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:01.754
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

821
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Howard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ship let's just.</v>

822
00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:04.214
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to be at the alien ship by the </v>

823
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:11.010
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to mention the alien ship fusion.</v>

824
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:12.711
<v Speaker 3>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>

825
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:13.544
<v Speaker 3>So you originally said Independent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I get your frustrations with the </v>

826
00:35:15.831 --> 00:35:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Democrats watching this understands I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you on that.</v>

827
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.510
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what caused you to shift?</v>

828
00:35:20.511 --> 00:35:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Was that purely a tactical?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just even back to Democrat.</v>

829
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

830
00:35:24.921 --> 00:35:25.754
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit like it's probably </v>

831
00:35:27.981 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 3>more emotional and sort of about just </v>
<v Speaker 3>who I am and just kind of being like not</v>

832
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:35.090
<v Speaker 3>wanting to give up on this thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed in.</v>

833
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:35.751
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

834
00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:40.751
<v Speaker 3>I think the Democratic Party up until </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1975 was right on a bunch of stuff.</v>

835
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.753
<v Speaker 3>It started getting really crazy after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and frankly started becoming kind </v>

836
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 3>of the opposite of what it was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

837
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.303
<v Speaker 3>Particularly in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It became really an aristocratic party </v>

838
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.920
<v Speaker 3>we've put in place and almost a feudal </v>
<v Speaker 3>system in this state where you have just</v>

839
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:56.754
<v Speaker 3>a huge number of very wealthy people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We subsidize a small number of lottery </v>

840
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:00.384
<v Speaker 3>winning poor people who basically work </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the servant class for the rich and </v>

841
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 3>then we drive the middle class people </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the state and,</v>

842
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.420
<v Speaker 3>and that is not what the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>Party was about before 1975.</v>

843
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.313
<v Speaker 3>And you truly are not being hyperbolic </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this because just as someone that </v>

844
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 3>bought a house in the last year that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>house prices,</v>

845
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:17.970
<v Speaker 3>and you referenced this earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the housing crisis,</v>

846
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 3>the house prices are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are legitimately insane.</v>

847
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Where I used to live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

848
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.260
<v Speaker 3>now I'm in a cheaper area here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say exactly where,</v>

849
00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:26.094
<v Speaker 3>but where I used to live in west </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood to get literally a one </v>

850
00:36:29.431 --> 00:36:30.264
<v Speaker 3>bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one bathroom house that wasn't </v>

851
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.370
<v Speaker 3>completely dilapidated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally a million dollar.</v>

852
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

853
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:37.554
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look in 2011 when Jerry Brown took </v>

854
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.300
<v Speaker 3>office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over half of Californians could afford a</v>

855
00:36:41.301 --> 00:36:42.134
<v Speaker 3>middle class home today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just 28 percent can millennials in </v>

856
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only a quarter own homes.</v>

857
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.500
<v Speaker 3>And the rest of the country it's over 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

858
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.710
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a millennial or renter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

859
00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.180
<v Speaker 3>you work for your salary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

860
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.840
<v Speaker 3>you're on the losing side of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>California has got this set up.</v>

861
00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.693
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's why I'm running is I the more </v>

862
00:37:00.661 --> 00:37:01.494
<v Speaker 3>I learned about the corruption and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really just the destruction of the </v>

863
00:37:04.321 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 3>California dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

864
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:06.654
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which actually precedes the American </v>

865
00:37:07.891 --> 00:37:08.461
<v Speaker 3>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

866
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:12.420
<v Speaker 3>historically California dream was </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity owner home,</v>

867
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.000
<v Speaker 3>great schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful weather.</v>

868
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.120
<v Speaker 3>We slowed the good weather when there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fire coming mudslide.</v>

869
00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>

870
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

871
00:37:22.381 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 3>so it's like the state is full of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradictions,</v>

872
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We say we're the most progressive state,</v>

873
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 3>but we have the highest poverty rate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the highest levels of inequality.</v>

874
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we say we're the land of opportunity,</v>

875
00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:33.330
<v Speaker 3>but we won't let people build homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

876
00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:36.210
<v Speaker 3>we have this incredible gift which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this tech economy.</v>

877
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Silicon Valley is really driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic growth,</v>

878
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:41.670
<v Speaker 3>not just in the state but in the country</v>
<v Speaker 3>and arguably around the world.</v>

879
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.743
<v Speaker 3>And yet like we won't let people build </v>
<v Speaker 3>like little apartment buildings are a </v>

880
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:46.920
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little new subdivisions.</v>

881
00:37:46.921 --> 00:37:47.754
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've got spectacular natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas that we're always going to </v>

882
00:37:50.521 --> 00:37:52.680
<v Speaker 3>protect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the most stunning thing.</v>

883
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.860
<v Speaker 3>The biggest use of land and the state is</v>
<v Speaker 3>cattle ranching,</v>

884
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 3>still like a 19th century economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>

885
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.560
<v Speaker 3>And we won't let people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

886
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.403
<v Speaker 3>We can't let people build a home because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the cattle were putting cattle and </v>

887
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:07.750
<v Speaker 3>cows before middleclass people before </v>
<v Speaker 3>millennials that,</v>

888
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and me,</v>

889
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 3>a gen x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might be able to sneak in there.</v>

890
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:14.460
<v Speaker 3>We got our homes at the law we got in </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they shut the door finally.</v>

891
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.353
<v Speaker 3>But millennials are really in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless we can significantly expand </v>

892
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:19.104
<v Speaker 3>housing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the solution in terms of </v>

893
00:38:22.081 --> 00:38:23.730
<v Speaker 3>taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me,</v>

894
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I've only been in La for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only a homeowner for,</v>

895
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.320
<v Speaker 3>or I've only been in California for five</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

896
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm only a homeowner for basically a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

897
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.870
<v Speaker 3>We were taxed at incredibly high levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

898
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 3>obviously I'm not into that and as</v>

899
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.873
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money that they're raising doesn't </v>

900
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:38.644
<v Speaker 1>seem to be doing the things in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping the people who need it the most </v>

901
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:43.504
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even really working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you fix that and how would you </v>

902
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:47.074
<v Speaker 1>fix that from inside?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The machine that you're saying is </v>

903
00:38:49.121 --> 00:38:50.140
<v Speaker 1>actually so corrupt?</v>

904
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.951
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>

905
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:52.690
<v Speaker 2>this was one of the most exciting parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

906
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:53.800
<v Speaker 2>it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

907
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.570
<v Speaker 2>because I was so focused on energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

908
00:38:55.571 --> 00:38:56.291
<v Speaker 2>and then it was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

909
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:57.124
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at California as a whole and my </v>

910
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:01.630
<v Speaker 2>brain's been hurting because there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much to learn,</v>

911
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.870
<v Speaker 2>but when you get a broader view of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you what you understood,</v>

912
00:39:04.871 --> 00:39:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you have a broader picture that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

913
00:39:06.071 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 2>we need high levels of economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need high paying jobs.</v>

914
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.863
<v Speaker 2>That means that we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to stop losing good </v>

915
00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:13.880
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing jobs to Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

916
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get Toyota to stay here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get,</v>

917
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really it's about supplying these</v>

918
00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:18.784
<v Speaker 2>big multinationals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boeing and our apple making high value </v>

919
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:24.940
<v Speaker 2>products for the high value components </v>
<v Speaker 2>to those,</v>

920
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 2>those products essentially</v>

921
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.570
<v Speaker 1>purely a tax break thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that purely the thesis?</v>

922
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:30.543
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just infrastructure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's just having housing for </v>

923
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:33.814
<v Speaker 2>their workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toyota took 3000 high paid executive </v>

924
00:39:35.861 --> 00:39:38.110
<v Speaker 2>jobs from California to Texas because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

925
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 2>because they couldn't afford the </v>
<v Speaker 2>housing,</v>

926
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:40.860
<v Speaker 2>the executives were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

927
00:39:40.861 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 2>in Texas I can buy a house for much </v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

928
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:44.044
<v Speaker 2>The median price home in California is </v>
<v Speaker 2>two and a half times higher than the </v>

929
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:46.984
<v Speaker 2>national average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just having more homes makes the </v>

930
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:52.270
<v Speaker 2>state more able to retain high paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

931
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.040
<v Speaker 2>So these things are all interconnected </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way.</v>

932
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:56.350
<v Speaker 2>So housing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes just infrastructure,</v>

933
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if an Amazon or a costco or </v>

934
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:00.034
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they need some infrastructure built </v>

935
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:03.550
<v Speaker 2>and it's a good deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be doing that.</v>

936
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:07.750
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that we're not is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leaders of our state and the leaders</v>

937
00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:09.370
<v Speaker 2>of this party really don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

938
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:14.550
<v Speaker 2>They really are about keeping California</v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive and elite to themselves.</v>

939
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.053
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really a country club kind of </v>

940
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:18.500
<v Speaker 2>liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

941
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.373
<v Speaker 2>It's really illiberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if Jerry Brown was sitting here and </v>

942
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:22.480
<v Speaker 2>heard you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

943
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.510
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is counter argument to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be.</v>

944
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.520
<v Speaker 2>He would say that he's been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get housing built,</v>

945
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 2>but he's just got these powerful special</v>
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

946
00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says that he does say it directly,</v>

947
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 2>so as the unions and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist are opposed to it now,</v>

948
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.913
<v Speaker 2>I've looked closely at this question and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is that most of the labor </v>

949
00:40:38.771 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 2>unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like sci,</v>

950
00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 2>you or the Teachers Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of teachers can afford a home</v>

951
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 2>in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

952
00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:45.424
<v Speaker 2>that's just scandalous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the unions want to see more </v>

953
00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:50.110
<v Speaker 2>housing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's three unions,</v>

954
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:52.360
<v Speaker 2>tiny trade unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics,</v>

955
00:40:52.361 --> 00:40:54.940
<v Speaker 2>the mechanical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electrical and plumbing,</v>

956
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:55.953
<v Speaker 2>which are basically working with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti development environmental </v>

957
00:40:58.961 --> 00:40:59.794
<v Speaker 2>organizations to prevent a reform that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would very modest reforms that would </v>

958
00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:08.320
<v Speaker 2>basically prevent frivolous lawsuits </v>
<v Speaker 2>under are very good environmental laws.</v>

959
00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:09.163
<v Speaker 2>We have good environmental laws that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>being destroyed by people using them to </v>

960
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:16.510
<v Speaker 2>block housing projects for reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have nothing to do with the environment.</v>

961
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:18.850
<v Speaker 2>In order to that they can manipulate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>projects,</v>

962
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.013
<v Speaker 2>get their way in a variety of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you give me an example of one of </v>

963
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:23.201
<v Speaker 2>those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

964
00:41:23.201 --> 00:41:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I totally can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Berkeley in my hometown,</v>

965
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.113
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times did a great piece on </v>

966
00:41:29.081 --> 00:41:29.914
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a single family home in </v>

967
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley that they wanted to a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>sized lot.</v>

968
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.910
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to demolish the home and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>up three homes,</v>

969
00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:38.853
<v Speaker 2>sort of switched them vertically and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a little driveway that would go in </v>

970
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 2>and one of the neighbors have organized </v>
<v Speaker 2>against it.</v>

971
00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.153
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the reasons they gave is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>complain that it would cast shade on </v>

972
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 2>their garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like they have a photo of the</v>

973
00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:51.104
<v Speaker 2>garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>The New York Times and it's just the </v>

974
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:53.600
<v Speaker 2>most pathetic looking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

975
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like that.</v>

976
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think those plants are </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive,</v>

977
00:41:56.061 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like they were like,</v>

978
00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we use it to produce food for ourselves.</v>

979
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:00.681
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that were true,</v>

980
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you'd all be starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

981
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.670
<v Speaker 2>So stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

982
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of a question,</v>

983
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it economically rational?</v>

984
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you allow another house get built,</v>

985
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.550
<v Speaker 2>will your property value decline?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think there's any.</v>

986
00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have more supply,</v>

987
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:18.854
<v Speaker 2>the prices would go down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just so much pent up demand </v>

988
00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:23.780
<v Speaker 2>for housing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think that's the case.</v>

989
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:27.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot of that petty stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The unions use it a lot to,</v>

990
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.823
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get high wage project labor </v>

991
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:32.450
<v Speaker 2>agreements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in favor of high wages,</v>

992
00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 2>especially if you have such high housing</v>
<v Speaker 2>prices but,</v>

993
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.060
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally you need a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>housing.</v>

994
00:42:38.061 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 2>We need a least twice as much housing </v>
<v Speaker 2>built annually.</v>

995
00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Then we're building just to keep pace </v>
<v Speaker 2>with demand.</v>

996
00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there some argument though for that,</v>

997
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:47.560
<v Speaker 1>for that family that doesn't want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shade in their backyard?</v>

998
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Even if the garden is nothing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever like I can think to here in La,</v>

999
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:54.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Playa Vista area,</v>

1000
00:42:54.201 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 1>that's where youtube and Google is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty much nothing there.</v>

1001
00:42:57.921 --> 00:43:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Then they put up all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what is insanely expensive?</v>

1002
00:43:00.681 --> 00:43:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm talking two or $3,000,000</v>

1003
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:04.184
<v Speaker 1>for a town home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even for your own home with </v>

1004
00:43:05.451 --> 00:43:08.180
<v Speaker 1>virtually no property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it seems to be.</v>

1005
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:09.014
<v Speaker 1>There's some argument for the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that did live there for 30 years that </v>

1006
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.590
<v Speaker 1>don't want all of this monstrous stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them.</v>

1007
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.453
<v Speaker 1>My slogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say this as someone that doesn't want </v>

1008
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 1>the government to mitigate all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1009
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the end of the day,</v>

1010
00:43:21.111 --> 00:43:23.090
<v Speaker 1>they might get bought out at a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice rate.</v>

1011
00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:23.924
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

1012
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.833
<v Speaker 1>So that would be good.</v>

1013
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my um,</v>

1014
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.660
<v Speaker 2>the slogan that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1015
00:43:27.661 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're playing with is um,</v>

1016
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.740
<v Speaker 2>give change a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1017
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean here you live in a city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1018
00:43:33.261 --> 00:43:34.094
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living in a city near mass </v>

1019
00:43:35.001 --> 00:43:35.781
<v Speaker 2>transit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1020
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 2>you're in an industrial heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1021
00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 2>your home has increased in value </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically and then you kind of go,</v>

1022
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:41.324
<v Speaker 2>we'll know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can make any change in my </v>

1023
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:44.330
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1024
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I just think everybody is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be more reasonable.</v>

1025
00:43:46.971 --> 00:43:47.804
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my basic view is like there needs to be </v>

1026
00:43:49.071 --> 00:43:49.904
<v Speaker 2>more housing everywhere in the cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the suburbs protect our natural </v>

1027
00:43:53.751 --> 00:43:54.740
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fine.</v>

1028
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:55.603
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so much land in the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of land in the cities and the </v>

1029
00:43:58.431 --> 00:44:01.010
<v Speaker 2>suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone just needs to be a bit more,</v>

1030
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 2>give a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a little bit more reasonable.</v>

1031
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.623
<v Speaker 2>and the reforms that I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>are things were don't allow multiple </v>

1033
00:44:08.091 --> 00:44:10.400
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits against one project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1034
00:44:10.401 --> 00:44:12.980
<v Speaker 2>and make sure that you have to identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself right now.</v>

1035
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.040
<v Speaker 2>You can sue anonymously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:16.340
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna,</v>

1037
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 2>try to stop an important project to </v>
<v Speaker 2>house these really valuable workers.</v>

1038
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:21.584
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we have brought people from all </v>

1039
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:22.874
<v Speaker 2>around the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all around the world who are these </v>

1040
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:27.470
<v Speaker 2>talented technology programmers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketing type people or whatever.</v>

1041
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:28.550
<v Speaker 2>And then we say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1042
00:44:28.551 --> 00:44:31.190
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay $4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a month for a one bedroom,</v>

1043
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they want to buy a home,</v>

1044
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 2>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out of luck.</v>

1045
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:35.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1046
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what the California dream was</v>

1047
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about,</v>

1048
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:41.310
<v Speaker 2>I got mine and now forget everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1049
00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:43.590
<v Speaker 2>The California dream was expansive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1050
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.700
<v Speaker 2>it was said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1051
00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:45.534
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

1052
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.530
<v Speaker 2>an amazing state in the greatest state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the greatest country in the world.</v>

1053
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.033
<v Speaker 2>We've got to be more open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sense basically you want lower </v>

1054
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:56.670
<v Speaker 2>taxes basically.</v>

1055
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:57.241
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

1056
00:44:57.241 --> 00:44:59.550
<v Speaker 2>that's going to put you at somebody with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats.</v>

1057
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1058
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.360
<v Speaker 2>on the taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about taxes.</v>

1059
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand is that like there's sort of </v>

1060
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:07.014
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would I do if I could start with a </v>

1061
00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:09.290
<v Speaker 2>blank piece of paper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1062
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.231
<v Speaker 2>and then there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1063
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:11.580
<v Speaker 2>if you become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you become governor,</v>

1064
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:14.610
<v Speaker 2>you're immediately negotiating with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different interests.</v>

1065
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.550
<v Speaker 2>And by interests I don't mean just even </v>
<v Speaker 2>organized interest groups.</v>

1066
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I just mean like homeowners who are kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>

1067
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to change.</v>

1068
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 2>So there's a very famous law in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

1069
00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:27.831
<v Speaker 2>probably no prop 13 passed in 1978 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it restricts how much taxes can go up on</v>

1070
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:29.754
<v Speaker 2>a home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you bought a home for a half a </v>

1071
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:35.430
<v Speaker 2>million dollars and it increased to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars in say five years,</v>

1072
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.020
<v Speaker 2>you would only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only,</v>

1073
00:45:37.021 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 2>they can only increase your taxes two </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent a year.</v>

1074
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1075
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.053
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason given a sort of a sound </v>

1076
00:45:43.631 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 2>sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that you don't want to,</v>

1077
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:46.044
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1078
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.090
<v Speaker 2>someone for no fault of their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling,</v>

1079
00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:48.933
<v Speaker 2>their house is worth a lot and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly they're being hit with the tax </v>

1080
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:52.890
<v Speaker 2>bill they can't afford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you basically,</v>

1081
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.780
<v Speaker 2>even though you've had a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment,</v>

1082
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.200
<v Speaker 2>you can't even afford your investment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that,</v>

1084
00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.653
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there just needs to be some </v>

1085
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:01.134
<v Speaker 2>reasonableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's considered the third rail of </v>

1086
00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 2>California politics to even suggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>reforming prop 13.</v>

1087
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:07.703
<v Speaker 2>But I think we do need to reform it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of the reason is that our </v>

1088
00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:14.270
<v Speaker 2>current taxes are so lopsided with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest sales tax in the country,</v>

1089
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:16.800
<v Speaker 2>the highest income taxes on the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>earners.</v>

1090
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.413
<v Speaker 2>And you might go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's progressive because they </v>

1091
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:21.200
<v Speaker 2>have more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>

1092
00:46:21.201 --> 00:46:23.580
<v Speaker 2>is that every time the economy goes into</v>
<v Speaker 2>recession,</v>

1093
00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 2>we're just in massive debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1094
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.470
<v Speaker 2>So the when and then when we have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>surplus like we had this year,</v>

1095
00:46:28.471 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 2>it's because the stock market's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>going crazy.</v>

1096
00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:32.550
<v Speaker 2>So when the one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's Kinda funny that people that are</v>

1097
00:46:32.551 --> 00:46:34.050
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to tax the one percent more.</v>

1098
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:36.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we've made the entire economy,</v>

1099
00:46:36.121 --> 00:46:37.710
<v Speaker 2>all of our schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1100
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:38.544
<v Speaker 2>all of these government services </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely dependent on the fortunes of </v>

1101
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:41.544
<v Speaker 2>the stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're a state founded on boom and </v>

1102
00:46:43.441 --> 00:46:47.070
<v Speaker 2>bust the gold rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we gotta get more stability in those</v>

1103
00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:49.080
<v Speaker 2>finances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's just got to be.</v>

1104
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I think these things like housing reform</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think has to be done as a whole.</v>

1105
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 2>And I think similarly the tax and budget</v>
<v Speaker 2>form has to be done as a whole because I</v>

1106
00:46:57.511 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 2>think everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a classic prisoner's dilemma,</v>

1107
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like,</v>

1108
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.940
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not going to want to think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and I'm going to stay on,</v>

1109
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.060
<v Speaker 2>stay strong because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:07.650
<v Speaker 2>make them get first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's going to have to be.</v>

1111
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm still like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1112
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I can't make my slogan be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more reasonable,</v>

1113
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.860
<v Speaker 2>but dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1114
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.590
<v Speaker 2>but I think you've got to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what you're supposed to do</v>

1115
00:47:16.591 --> 00:47:18.070
<v Speaker 2>as governor race was to bring to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table,</v>

1116
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:18.913
<v Speaker 2>kind of go look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's gonna need to make some </v>

1117
00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:23.550
<v Speaker 2>compromises and I don't think they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>that big.</v>

1118
00:47:23.551 --> 00:47:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you fly over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean certainly la,</v>

1119
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:28.380
<v Speaker 2>the bay area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a lot of single family homes,</v>

1120
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 2>like everywhere and you're kind of</v>

1121
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.311
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1122
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:32.020
<v Speaker 3>you're right in the middle of the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1123
00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 3>you gotta allow like a four or five </v>
<v Speaker 3>story building to go up.</v>

1124
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:35.764
<v Speaker 3>And similarly you see a lot of lawsuits </v>
<v Speaker 3>to block like additional homes in the </v>

1125
00:47:39.161 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 3>suburbs by the people that just had </v>
<v Speaker 3>their homes built in the suburbs.</v>

1126
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always like,</v>

1127
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:45.754
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last guy up the ladder is the one </v>

1128
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 3>that's like most fiercely kicking it </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1129
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.451
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1130
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:52.220
<v Speaker 3>West Hollywood that I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put a moratorium.</v>

1131
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:53.063
<v Speaker 3>They were building all these sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were kind of calling like </v>

1132
00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:55.540
<v Speaker 3>these mcmansions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1133
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 3>these very modern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tall things.</v>

1134
00:47:57.431 --> 00:47:58.264
<v Speaker 3>And then they were basically dotting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods thus causing shade and </v>

1135
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 3>everyone else's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually stopped them from doing it</v>

1136
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 3>for awhile I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it just expired.</v>

1137
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.630
<v Speaker 3>So I mean you kind of go look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1138
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:08.810
<v Speaker 3>you won the lottery.</v>

1139
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.710
<v Speaker 3>You if you bought a home in California </v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime in the last,</v>

1140
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:13.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years or you know,</v>

1141
00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:17.740
<v Speaker 3>even like you've probably seen your </v>
<v Speaker 3>prices even go up just one last year.</v>

1142
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:18.993
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've done really well like you've </v>

1143
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've often male.</v>

1144
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.290
<v Speaker 3>If you bought your home in like 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1145
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:27.124
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1146
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 3>or if you bought it in 2000 or 1990 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>1980,</v>

1147
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 3>you made a big chunk of money on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

1148
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.560
<v Speaker 3>So then then to then turn around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1149
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.140
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my taxes shouldn't go up at all,</v>

1150
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.160
<v Speaker 3>is just unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1151
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just not fair to everybody else </v>

1152
00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:44.320
<v Speaker 3>who comes in later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1153
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 3>they show you in my home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought my home,</v>

1154
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:50.080
<v Speaker 3>I pay 10 times more in taxes on my home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the people that owned it prior,</v>

1155
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:51.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay a </v>

1156
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:55.450
<v Speaker 3>little bit more in taxes coming a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit later and uh,</v>

1157
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.330
<v Speaker 3>know maybe a higher income,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 10 times,</v>

1158
00:48:58.570 --> 00:48:59.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1159
00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.960
<v Speaker 3>that's the part where it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it exactly going to be?</v>

1160
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.793
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiate something that's just a lot </v>

1161
00:49:04.001 --> 00:49:07.210
<v Speaker 3>more fair than my current situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that you're kind of talking about</v>

1162
00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:08.044
<v Speaker 3>this in a holistic way because it seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me that you definitely still have </v>

1163
00:49:10.331 --> 00:49:12.790
<v Speaker 3>some progressive leanings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is totally fine,</v>

1164
00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:13.803
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell you also have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian leanings and I actually do </v>

1165
00:49:16.271 --> 00:49:18.250
<v Speaker 3>think that that's where most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall,</v>

1166
00:49:18.251 --> 00:49:19.084
<v Speaker 3>which is why I think that this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting center that's developing </v>

1167
00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 3>lately makes some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1168
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:24.281
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1169
00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:26.820
<v Speaker 3>the market is absolutely amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1170
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:31.630
<v Speaker 3>And does so well on so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't do everything,</v>

1171
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:32.543
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it just seems to have to </v>

1172
00:49:32.861 --> 00:49:33.830
<v Speaker 3>be so extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1173
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1174
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:36.183
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most of the major technologies and </v>

1175
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:39.040
<v Speaker 3>the iphone came out of the Defense </v>
<v Speaker 3>Department,</v>

1176
00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:39.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jet turbines which allows us to do jet </v>

1177
00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:43.090
<v Speaker 3>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out of the military.</v>

1178
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.081
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1179
00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the technologies that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>making the environment better.</v>

1180
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electric cars,</v>

1181
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:48.784
<v Speaker 3>fuel cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things are all supported by </v>

1182
00:49:49.481 --> 00:49:50.314
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>r and d when you're talking about 20 </v>

1183
00:49:52.121 --> 00:49:52.954
<v Speaker 3>years of subsidies to industries that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are plowing money into campaign </v>

1184
00:49:56.711 --> 00:49:59.530
<v Speaker 3>contributions and the technology's still</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't very good.</v>

1185
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:00.423
<v Speaker 3>That's when you have real problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost impossible to beat that </v>

1186
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:03.491
<v Speaker 3>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1187
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:04.324
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what you're up against </v>

1188
00:50:05.051 --> 00:50:05.884
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to really say we got to </v>

1189
00:50:06.791 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 3>stop subsidizing some of this massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I suspect Jerry Brown probably</v>

1190
00:50:10.931 --> 00:50:11.764
<v Speaker 3>gets a lot of money from those guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just just that the machine itself has </v>

1191
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:17.690
<v Speaker 3>existed for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what you're up again.</v>

1192
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's cool is that,</v>

1193
00:50:19.061 --> 00:50:22.630
<v Speaker 3>so when I got into this discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this really this corruption scandal that</v>

1194
00:50:22.631 --> 00:50:25.150
<v Speaker 3>I think is really important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people their eyes glaze over,</v>

1195
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 3>it involves the public utilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's like,</v>

1196
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:28.784
<v Speaker 3>all</v>

1197
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

1198
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:31.034
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I learned about it is I was </v>

1199
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:32.091
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1200
00:50:32.091 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 2>how do public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

1201
00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.480
<v Speaker 2>how do you solve corruption?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a history here.</v>

1202
00:50:35.481 --> 00:50:36.314
<v Speaker 2>So what you discover is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just these natural cycles of corruption </v>

1203
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:42.460
<v Speaker 2>and reform and they've occurred several </v>
<v Speaker 2>times in the 20th century.</v>

1204
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.313
<v Speaker 2>One of them occurred in the 19 twenties </v>
<v Speaker 2>and thirties and other one occurred in </v>

1205
00:50:45.411 --> 00:50:47.120
<v Speaker 2>the 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

1206
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.580
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're overdue for another period of</v>

1207
00:50:49.581 --> 00:50:50.460
<v Speaker 2>reform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

1208
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people kind of go,</v>

1209
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:53.720
<v Speaker 2>you're up against this huge machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1210
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you knew how bad it,</v>

1211
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.533
<v Speaker 2>if you knew how corrupt it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know you will be all about </v>

1212
00:50:58.491 --> 00:50:59.230
<v Speaker 2>overthrowing it.</v>

1213
00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:00.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that not though a purely libertarian </v>

1214
00:51:02.141 --> 00:51:04.660
<v Speaker 1>argument that it's like we keep going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through these phases,</v>

1215
00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:06.940
<v Speaker 1>then we put in new laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gets better for a little while,</v>

1216
00:51:06.941 --> 00:51:07.774
<v Speaker 1>then it gets worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the libertarian argument would </v>

1217
00:51:09.071 --> 00:51:11.860
<v Speaker 1>be all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of all these laws were extremely</v>

1218
00:51:11.861 --> 00:51:12.694
<v Speaker 1>overregulated here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of all of this and let's just </v>

1219
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.630
<v Speaker 1>see what the market actually does </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we just simply don't.</v>

1220
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.491
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1221
00:51:19.491 --> 00:51:21.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got for some things.</v>

1222
00:51:21.021 --> 00:51:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for others,</v>

1223
00:51:22.401 --> 00:51:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are natural monopolies,</v>

1224
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:26.294
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electricity things where you're just </v>

1225
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:28.484
<v Speaker 2>doing a lot of infrastructure that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very expensive and then you're kinda </v>

1226
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:32.151
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1227
00:51:32.151 --> 00:51:34.960
<v Speaker 2>so we're gonna have two electric </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies like stringing of electric.</v>

1228
00:51:34.961 --> 00:51:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we got,</v>

1229
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:41.060
<v Speaker 2>that's why we regulate electric </v>
<v Speaker 2>utilities and the way we do.</v>

1230
00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now some of them have been privatized,</v>

1231
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:44.443
<v Speaker 2>but you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have monopoly for the Poles </v>

1232
00:51:47.001 --> 00:51:48.530
<v Speaker 2>and wires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it's like,</v>

1233
00:51:48.531 --> 00:51:50.630
<v Speaker 2>it's already really ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all the electrical wires,</v>

1234
00:51:50.631 --> 00:51:51.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an environmentalist,</v>

1235
00:51:51.681 --> 00:51:53.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll bury those.</v>

1236
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1237
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.431
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1238
00:51:55.431 --> 00:51:57.140
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna have a whole second or third</v>

1239
00:51:57.141 --> 00:51:59.570
<v Speaker 2>set of electrical wires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the government was like,</v>

1240
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just you can have a monopoly and you can</v>

1241
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:05.090
<v Speaker 2>even be a privately owned company but </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't price gouge.</v>

1242
00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:05.963
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you're going to come to us and </v>

1243
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:07.730
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey gotta raise rates.</v>

1244
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:08.721
<v Speaker 2>And we kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1245
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:09.554
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of it's negotiated and just a </v>

1246
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 2>little bit messier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there corruption?</v>

1247
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Definitely some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some extent.</v>

1248
00:52:15.921 --> 00:52:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Is it inevitable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is,</v>

1249
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:18.923
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's inevitable meaning that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the way the system worked </v>

1250
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:22.123
<v Speaker 1>there eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're being controlled a </v>

1251
00:52:23.521 --> 00:52:24.354
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still the only game in town so </v>

1252
00:52:26.131 --> 00:52:28.890
<v Speaker 1>they can always keep ratcheting it up.</v>

1253
00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1254
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.220
<v Speaker 2>like Jerry Brown's father I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved amazing things in California,</v>

1255
00:52:33.221 --> 00:52:34.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universities,</v>

1256
00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:36.430
<v Speaker 2>the roads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water systems,</v>

1257
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.983
<v Speaker 2>it was a period of high growth as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he benefited from was there some </v>

1258
00:52:40.871 --> 00:52:42.670
<v Speaker 2>political corruption in the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing so,</v>

1259
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.960
<v Speaker 2>giving some contracts to sure you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want is to make sure it doesn't</v>

1260
00:52:46.961 --> 00:52:50.140
<v Speaker 2>become proportions like we see in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing world,</v>

1261
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.950
<v Speaker 2>spend much time in central Africa or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin America and you're just getting.</v>

1262
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:54.993
<v Speaker 2>You get to the point where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption is so severe that nothing </v>

1263
00:52:56.621 --> 00:52:57.454
<v Speaker 2>gets built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at the end of the day it was </v>

1264
00:52:58.751 --> 00:53:01.510
<v Speaker 2>corruption and Korea where I spent a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of time at the end of the day they</v>

1265
00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:02.890
<v Speaker 2>get the thing built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1266
00:53:02.891 --> 00:53:04.720
<v Speaker 2>in other places if you don't get a bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1267
00:53:04.721 --> 00:53:05.554
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think we've just gotten to a point </v>

1268
00:53:06.911 --> 00:53:09.790
<v Speaker 2>where it's just gotten so excessive in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

1269
00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.653
<v Speaker 2>the just the exchange of contributions </v>
<v Speaker 2>for contracts and permits has just got </v>

1270
00:53:14.811 --> 00:53:18.640
<v Speaker 2>to the place where it's just obscene and</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be fixed and as usual,</v>

1271
00:53:18.641 --> 00:53:19.630
<v Speaker 2>the best way to fix it.</v>

1272
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:21.520
<v Speaker 2>It's just with sunlight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transparency,</v>

1273
00:53:21.521 --> 00:53:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1274
00:53:22.571 --> 00:53:27.060
<v Speaker 2>they all have these really bad deeds can</v>
<v Speaker 2>only occur behind the cover of darkness.</v>

1275
00:53:27.061 --> 00:53:30.600
<v Speaker 2>And so once you shine a light on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tends to take care of itself.</v>

1276
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Sunlight is the best disinfectant it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has been a theme around here.</v>

1277
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:35.423
<v Speaker 2>So just tell me about a couple of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other issues that you actually care </v>

1278
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:39.300
<v Speaker 2>about that you're campaigning on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1279
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the ones I'm really excited about</v>
<v Speaker 2>is education and you know,</v>

1280
00:53:42.121 --> 00:53:42.954
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I love about going into an issue </v>

1281
00:53:43.801 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 2>that you're sort of new to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1282
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:46.920
<v Speaker 2>my mom is a public school teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a public,</v>

1283
00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:50.370
<v Speaker 2>was the teacher's Union Rep and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>sister is a,</v>

1284
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:52.620
<v Speaker 2>is an education expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's certainly something we've talked</v>

1285
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 2>about for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's the fun to go back into it?</v>

1286
00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:56.163
<v Speaker 2>Associate fresh and you start to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>these fights and arguments between </v>

1287
00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:59.950
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1288
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.830
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a different point of view.</v>

1289
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:02.663
<v Speaker 2>I'm not participating in them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what was so striking for us when we </v>

1290
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:05.634
<v Speaker 2>looked at the research was that what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear is that we've got the school </v>

1291
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 2>schedule that makes everybody unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1292
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.930
<v Speaker 2>You go to school at like eight and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get out at like 2:30,</v>

1293
00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:18.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like all the bad things as you,</v>

1294
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:20.850
<v Speaker 2>as you and I know from our childhoods </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs between 2:30</v>

1295
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:21.684
<v Speaker 2>and when your parents come up and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these after through the best </v>

1296
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.260
<v Speaker 2>hours of like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1297
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1298
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take them away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

1299
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:29.483
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think schools have to work for </v>

1300
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:32.130
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it be nine to five,</v>

1301
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.203
<v Speaker 2>like why is it you have to cobble </v>
<v Speaker 2>together afterschool programs and these </v>

1302
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 2>things and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

1303
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:39.090
<v Speaker 2>often kids fall behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1304
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:40.800
<v Speaker 2>I also think the school year should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>

1305
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.023
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think teachers want to be treated </v>

1306
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:44.484
<v Speaker 2>like professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing more demoralizing for </v>

1307
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:46.854
<v Speaker 2>teachers than like bad teachers because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what my parents would come home </v>

1308
00:54:48.511 --> 00:54:50.190
<v Speaker 2>and complain about bad teachers all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1309
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.800
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to build to move out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad principals,</v>

1310
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:56.490
<v Speaker 2>move out the bad teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to have a proper professional</v>

1311
00:54:56.491 --> 00:54:58.770
<v Speaker 2>school day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that first part though,</v>

1312
00:54:58.771 --> 00:54:59.604
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big fight you'd be taking </v>

1313
00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:02.560
<v Speaker 2>against it is absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1314
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:03.810
<v Speaker 2>And they've got to give.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1315
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.670
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the teachers are unhappy.</v>

1316
00:55:05.671 --> 00:55:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean the turnover rate is just through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the roof.</v>

1317
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1318
00:55:08.311 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 2>17 percent of them can't afford to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1319
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:11.334
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do think teachers that are </v>

1320
00:55:13.321 --> 00:55:14.154
<v Speaker 2>performing should be paid better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the school should be nine to </v>

1321
00:55:16.921 --> 00:55:17.754
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the school year should be </v>

1322
00:55:18.421 --> 00:55:19.254
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we know is that the more time that </v>

1323
00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:21.114
<v Speaker 2>kids get instructional time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their performance goes up and our </v>

1324
00:55:23.761 --> 00:55:26.910
<v Speaker 2>performance in California has been going</v>
<v Speaker 2>down even though we put $20 million more</v>

1325
00:55:26.911 --> 00:55:29.130
<v Speaker 2>in the schools over the last seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1326
00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's what seems to be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>places that again,</v>

1327
00:55:31.681 --> 00:55:33.300
<v Speaker 2>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy California.</v>

1328
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:35.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like you keep pumping money into </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1329
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.533
<v Speaker 2>but then every time we tested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you look at the numbers and </v>

1330
00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:40.830
<v Speaker 2>we compare you state by state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worse.</v>

1331
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:42.690
<v Speaker 2>It's worse than it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's frankly,</v>

1332
00:55:42.691 --> 00:55:44.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a scandal and the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer the most,</v>

1333
00:55:44.971 --> 00:55:46.920
<v Speaker 2>it's the usual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poor African Americans,</v>

1334
00:55:46.921 --> 00:55:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1335
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.790
<v Speaker 2>performance has been flat line or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>declining.</v>

1336
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:51.811
<v Speaker 2>And so because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
00:55:51.811 --> 00:55:52.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're wealthy,</v>

1338
00:55:52.921 --> 00:55:53.550
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1339
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.383
<v Speaker 2>if you're privileged you can send your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids to private summer science camp and </v>

1340
00:55:57.391 --> 00:55:58.410
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1341
00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 2>So I would like to see a significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>reform.</v>

1342
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to go with taxes.</v>

1343
00:56:02.251 --> 00:56:04.680
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to go year round is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably going to cost more.</v>

1344
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 2>How are we going to finance that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1345
00:56:07.711 --> 00:56:10.200
<v Speaker 2>you just got to have a wholesale reform </v>
<v Speaker 2>of taxes.</v>

1346
00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:12.060
<v Speaker 2>I think education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is exciting though,</v>

1347
00:56:12.061 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 2>is that a longer school day and a longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>school year,</v>

1348
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:16.404
<v Speaker 2>it means you have more time to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>instructional on math and science and </v>

1349
00:56:19.021 --> 00:56:21.570
<v Speaker 2>reading which kids need to get up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>snuff.</v>

1350
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 2>But then you also have the time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff arts,</v>

1351
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical education.</v>

1352
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:29.690
<v Speaker 3>We need to do more physical education </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it allows for the dea.</v>

1353
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.573
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we have a digital technology </v>

1354
00:56:31.241 --> 00:56:32.074
<v Speaker 3>revolution happening in this state that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're leading and the place that it has </v>

1355
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:37.060
<v Speaker 3>not penetrated at all is like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools,</v>

1356
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's some amount of laptop </v>
<v Speaker 3>use,</v>

1357
00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:43.440
<v Speaker 3>but what you get with the digital </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution is that you can be a so,</v>

1358
00:56:43.441 --> 00:56:44.274
<v Speaker 3>so math lecturer or teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the kids can get it now on Khan </v>

1359
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.233
<v Speaker 3>Academy or they can watch Ted talks that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that do a much better job </v>

1360
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 3>explaining it and then the teachers can </v>
<v Speaker 3>roam and be tutors.</v>

1361
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.473
<v Speaker 3>My mom was also a tutor and when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid one time she tutored me and she </v>

1362
00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:01.840
<v Speaker 3>usually tutored learning disabled kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she treated me.</v>

1363
00:57:01.841 --> 00:57:02.271
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1364
00:57:02.271 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned so much in like an hour.</v>

1365
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tutoring works with all kids.</v>

1366
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:07.091
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1367
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:10.120
<v Speaker 3>tutoring works with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you call it flipping the classroom.</v>

1368
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Kids get the lectures from digital </v>
<v Speaker 3>devices,</v>

1369
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:16.520
<v Speaker 3>chromebooks or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or smart phones or just from TV's.</v>

1370
00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:17.603
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the teachers can roam and do </v>

1371
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:19.384
<v Speaker 3>tutoring and then that allows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that solves a big problem which is that </v>

1372
00:57:22.301 --> 00:57:23.134
<v Speaker 3>both the overachieving kids and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underachieving kids are being neglected </v>

1373
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:27.503
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as teachers try to get the kids in the </v>

1374
00:57:28.601 --> 00:57:29.434
<v Speaker 3>middle to pass the tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting concept because </v>

1375
00:57:31.811 --> 00:57:34.570
<v Speaker 3>there is so much information accessible </v>
<v Speaker 3>at your fingertips.</v>

1376
00:57:34.571 --> 00:57:37.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean the amount of people that watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows like this.</v>

1377
00:57:37.211 --> 00:57:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Just for some information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Greg Gutfeld,</v>

1378
00:57:39.791 --> 00:57:40.624
<v Speaker 3>he's been on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote a great piece a couple of weeks </v>

1379
00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:45.370
<v Speaker 3>ago about how it's like all the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're supposed to learn in college</v>

1380
00:57:45.371 --> 00:57:46.204
<v Speaker 3>that unfortunately now because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hysteria colleges that you're not </v>

1381
00:57:48.851 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1382
00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.433
<v Speaker 3>You can go online and hear lectures from</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible professors like Jordan </v>

1383
00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:54.573
<v Speaker 3>Peterson again said and listen to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys tell you all of the things that </v>

1384
00:57:57.311 --> 00:57:59.230
<v Speaker 3>they're supposed to be telling you at </v>
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>

1385
00:57:59.231 --> 00:58:00.760
<v Speaker 3>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Youtube,</v>

1386
00:58:00.761 --> 00:58:01.990
<v Speaker 3>it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful.</v>

1387
00:58:01.991 --> 00:58:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful.</v>

1388
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Khan Academy is this beautiful.</v>

1389
00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:07.300
<v Speaker 3>My daughter does it on her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has an iphone.</v>

1390
00:58:07.301 --> 00:58:09.250
<v Speaker 3>She's 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I was a reluctant about,</v>

1391
00:58:09.251 --> 00:58:10.540
<v Speaker 3>but with what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With Khan Academy,</v>

1392
00:58:10.541 --> 00:58:11.374
<v Speaker 3>these beautifully perfect lectures that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are designed to that we know that they </v>

1393
00:58:13.871 --> 00:58:15.910
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids then interact with it.</v>

1394
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.570
<v Speaker 3>You still need to have a role for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you need the interaction,</v>

1395
00:58:19.571 --> 00:58:21.280
<v Speaker 3>you need the group work between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

1396
00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:22.283
<v Speaker 3>You knew the teachers going around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean we are just massively </v>

1397
00:58:25.421 --> 00:58:28.630
<v Speaker 3>underperforming as a country and as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>state when it comes to education,</v>

1398
00:58:28.631 --> 00:58:29.464
<v Speaker 3>we're getting our tails beat by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by my much poor developing countries </v>

1399
00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:33.604
<v Speaker 3>like Korea.</v>

1400
00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.133
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the longer school I hear that and I </v>

1401
00:58:37.901 --> 00:58:41.570
<v Speaker 3>think suddenly I became a 12 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I know about myself.</v>

1402
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:44.170
<v Speaker 3>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you actually mean by that?</v>

1403
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1404
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.353
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think cost is going to be something </v>

1405
00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:49.300
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna have to deal with because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

1406
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.860
<v Speaker 3>it will almost certainly cost more </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

1407
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:51.660
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1408
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got a nine month year now.</v>

1409
00:58:54.011 --> 00:58:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to see us get to 11 months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1410
00:58:56.321 --> 00:58:59.080
<v Speaker 3>some parents don't want to take their </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids away for a month or you know,</v>

1411
00:58:59.081 --> 00:58:59.914
<v Speaker 3>travel around or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like overloading kids with </v>

1412
00:59:01.691 --> 00:59:04.060
<v Speaker 3>information because I think we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>generally,</v>

1413
00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:04.894
<v Speaker 3>because of our smart phones and twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything is we're in an </v>

1414
00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:07.114
<v Speaker 3>information overload.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the value of that two month </v>

1415
00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:13.990
<v Speaker 3>break that we had as children will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is is that during that break</v>

1416
00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 3>was huge cognitive declines.</v>

1417
00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.650
<v Speaker 3>It's very well documented now that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

1418
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.513
<v Speaker 3>Kids will forget a lot of stuff and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start the next school year and you </v>

1419
00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:22.910
<v Speaker 3>review for the first several weeks or </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1420
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:23.773
<v Speaker 3>The older stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids that suffer the most are the </v>

1421
00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 3>less affluent kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>African American kids,</v>

1422
00:59:27.471 --> 00:59:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Latino kids whose parents don't send </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to science camp during the summer.</v>

1423
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:31.933
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of overloading the biggest </v>

1424
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:35.180
<v Speaker 3>problem of the overloading is the school</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1425
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.420
<v Speaker 3>You're cramming all this stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between like eight and two,</v>

1426
00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:40.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so sometimes somebody will be like,</v>

1427
00:59:40.821 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 3>well what about like elementary school?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like little kids need to take a nap,</v>

1428
00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1429
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:45.530
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a nap.</v>

1430
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the teachers could take an </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude.</v>

1431
00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 3>What about arts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think there should be more,</v>

1432
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a writer,</v>

1433
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:53.984
<v Speaker 3>I walk a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how I could ever write </v>

1434
00:59:56.001 --> 00:59:57.770
<v Speaker 3>anything if I didn't just walk and think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1435
00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:01.250
<v Speaker 3>So it should be more of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be more downtime to respect</v>

1436
01:00:01.251 --> 01:00:02.084
<v Speaker 3>the fact that our brains get tired and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids need some time off and the </v>

1437
01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:04.994
<v Speaker 3>first part of the day's gonna be more </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive than the second part of the </v>

1438
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:07.543
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you have more time you can deal </v>

1439
01:00:08.421 --> 01:00:09.254
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is that I'm going to </v>

1440
01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:14.000
<v Speaker 3>eliminate homework and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminate schoolwork for teachers.</v>

1441
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.863
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1442
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.550
<v Speaker 3>so get yourself back in your 12 year old</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

1443
01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 3>No more homework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the homework is done at school.</v>

1444
01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.043
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you were losing me a little bit </v>

1445
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:22.640
<v Speaker 3>with exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now no homework,</v>

1446
01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:25.820
<v Speaker 3>no homework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then my mom would come home,</v>

1447
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would come home from school,</v>

1448
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>4:00,</v>

1449
01:00:29.481 --> 01:00:30.590
<v Speaker 3>5:00,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make dinner,</v>

1450
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 3>and then she would go back to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>grading papers and preparing for lessons</v>

1451
01:00:34.491 --> 01:00:37.130
<v Speaker 3>like in the evenings when it should have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been family time.</v>

1452
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1453
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 3>and I think that what I'd like to say to</v>
<v Speaker 3>teachers is just go,</v>

1454
01:00:40.911 --> 01:00:42.530
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to leave work at work,</v>

1455
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.630
<v Speaker 3>you get to be what everybody else gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

1456
01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:46.520
<v Speaker 3>You go home from work and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to work anymore.</v>

1457
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:47.363
<v Speaker 3>I get to watch television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch a movie with your kids and then </v>

1458
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:52.280
<v Speaker 3>the kids too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get to leave the work at school and</v>

1459
01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 3>so the homework and the school work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grading and the lesson plans,</v>

1460
01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:59.990
<v Speaker 3>all that gets done at school and is </v>
<v Speaker 3>opened up by having kids are able to get</v>

1461
01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:00.824
<v Speaker 3>a personalized digital education with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the best world world's best </v>

1462
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:05.264
<v Speaker 3>lecturers and teachers online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's an interesting way of kind of </v>

1463
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:08.480
<v Speaker 3>splitting the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1464
01:01:08.481 --> 01:01:10.570
<v Speaker 3>we're going to extend this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:11.643
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sort of goes against my feeling </v>

1466
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:14.024
<v Speaker 3>about overloading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were going to build things in </v>

1467
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.963
<v Speaker 3>which are going to allow teachers to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do some more work and students </v>

1468
01:01:19.581 --> 01:01:20.120
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1469
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:20.953
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean kids are kids used to learn how </v>

1470
01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:24.380
<v Speaker 3>to draw like properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1471
01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:25.214
<v Speaker 3>And we have like art classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like who knows how to really just </v>

1472
01:01:27.231 --> 01:01:28.010
<v Speaker 3>draw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1473
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Like you look at the 19th century edgy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1474
01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:30.844
<v Speaker 3>you kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be one of the things that </v>

1475
01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:32.630
<v Speaker 3>gets taught again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1476
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:33.464
<v Speaker 3>you have some more time to actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also like a bunch of stuff </v>

1477
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:36.854
<v Speaker 3>now about like you need that social and </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional intelligence to perform well </v>

1478
01:01:39.561 --> 01:01:41.870
<v Speaker 3>in the business world and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to not be a jerk,</v>

1479
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are things that can all be taught,</v>

1480
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.553
<v Speaker 3>but you need to have the time for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This thing of rushing in 45 minutes </v>

1481
01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:51.930
<v Speaker 3>through math and rushing for the minutes</v>
<v Speaker 3>of reading in history is,</v>

1482
01:01:51.931 --> 01:01:52.691
<v Speaker 3>is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1483
01:01:52.691 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 3>it's based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1484
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:55.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were farmers,</v>

1485
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.173
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when we thought people were </v>

1486
01:01:56.391 --> 01:01:57.224
<v Speaker 3>preparing people for the factories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we know that we're all so different </v>

1487
01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:01.550
<v Speaker 3>and how we learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're at different levels.</v>

1488
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.090
<v Speaker 3>We can go at different paces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't very good at math.</v>

1489
01:02:04.091 --> 01:02:05.510
<v Speaker 3>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty good at reading.</v>

1490
01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:06.803
<v Speaker 3>You can get an education that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>tailored to you once you have that time </v>

1491
01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:15.320
<v Speaker 3>and you have to open up that digital </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe that already exists.</v>

1492
01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me a couple more.</v>

1493
01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your major thing.</v>

1494
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.440
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we went through,</v>

1495
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 3>so we went through housing,</v>

1496
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 2>we went through jobs and through schools</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously energy,</v>

1497
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.420
<v Speaker 2>cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable,</v>

1498
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:28.254
<v Speaker 2>clean energy is essential to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring back those good manufacturing </v>

1499
01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:32.551
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1500
01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:33.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have the wrong idea.</v>

1501
01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1502
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.063
<v Speaker 2>the manufacturing has to go abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high tech manufacturing needs to be </v>

1503
01:02:37.471 --> 01:02:38.304
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it needs cheap energy and it also </v>

1504
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:41.244
<v Speaker 2>needs skilled workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the other reforms that occurs </v>

1505
01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:44.094
<v Speaker 2>and as the relationship between the jobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the school's apprenticeship </v>

1506
01:02:46.531 --> 01:02:47.830
<v Speaker 2>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1507
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.313
<v Speaker 2>young people want to have mentors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to have masters that they </v>

1508
01:02:52.621 --> 01:02:53.454
<v Speaker 2>apprentice with will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's get Boeing and apple to have </v>

1509
01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 2>supplier companies here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in the central valley or in</v>

1510
01:02:58.801 --> 01:02:59.634
<v Speaker 2>La and it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a direct relationship to the high </v>

1511
01:03:01.501 --> 01:03:05.310
<v Speaker 2>schools and the community colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we need the cheap energy.</v>

1512
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.173
<v Speaker 2>So we've got two nuclear plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've shut down one of them through </v>

1513
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:10.494
<v Speaker 2>and that's what led to the corruption </v>
<v Speaker 2>scandal that trying to shut down the </v>

1514
01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:13.520
<v Speaker 2>second one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1515
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.910
<v Speaker 2>they provide total 40 percent of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean electricity in the state.</v>

1516
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.620
<v Speaker 2>I want to get them started back up </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1517
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.370
<v Speaker 2>People worry about the safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they shouldn't be worried,</v>

1518
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.503
<v Speaker 2>but the other cool thing that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they haven't made a lot of </v>

1519
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:29.880
<v Speaker 2>progress in what are called accident </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerant fuels,</v>

1520
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:34.710
<v Speaker 2>fuels that if there is a loss of coolant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a risk of overheating,</v>

1521
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.850
<v Speaker 2>it would take many hours and potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>many days before they overheat.</v>

1522
01:03:38.851 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 2>So if those fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fuels should be tested in our art.</v>

1523
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:44.940
<v Speaker 2>We were innovation central here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

1524
01:03:44.941 --> 01:03:47.820
<v Speaker 2>so we should be testing these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these innovative meltdown proof fuels,</v>

1525
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then really pioneering their use and</v>

1526
01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:53.310
<v Speaker 2>their diffusion throughout the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1527
01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 2>around the whole country and around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole world.</v>

1528
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1529
01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:56.941
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1530
01:03:56.941 --> 01:03:58.710
<v Speaker 2>there's just so many other needs for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that energy.</v>

1531
01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have abundant,</v>

1532
01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:01.620
<v Speaker 2>cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean energy,</v>

1533
01:04:01.621 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 2>then you can desalinate water.</v>

1534
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:03.893
<v Speaker 2>This whole water crisis that Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and California find themselves </v>

1535
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:09.480
<v Speaker 2>periodically in doesn't need to exist at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all with cheap,</v>

1536
01:04:09.481 --> 01:04:11.790
<v Speaker 2>abundant and clean energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can recycle the water,</v>

1537
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:12.743
<v Speaker 2>you can disseminate the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be plenty of water for the </v>

1538
01:04:14.731 --> 01:04:16.500
<v Speaker 2>farmers and for people that live in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>

1539
01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:19.320
<v Speaker 2>La should be green as idea that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn off our water.</v>

1540
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:20.453
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just part of that forced deprivation </v>

1541
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.233
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and manufactured scarcity that came out </v>

1542
01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.750
<v Speaker 2>of an ideological turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1543
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:30.180
<v Speaker 2>against the prosperity in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to.</v>

1544
01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the revolution that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to offend your telling me.</v>

1545
01:04:32.461 --> 01:04:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in between the roads go in one way</v>

1546
01:04:34.861 --> 01:04:35.694
<v Speaker 2>or the other and they have the grass </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not green anymore because we're </v>

1547
01:04:37.831 --> 01:04:39.660
<v Speaker 2>saving what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually not necessary.</v>

1548
01:04:39.661 --> 01:04:41.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1549
01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:41.934
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will cost some energy to desalinate </v>

1550
01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:43.840
<v Speaker 2>and to recycle.</v>

1551
01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.673
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we agreed to the whole desert in </v>

1552
01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:48.410
<v Speaker 2>California was deserts and turn them </v>
<v Speaker 2>into farms.</v>

1553
01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:48.860
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.920
<v Speaker 2>this whole area was very arid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1555
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.430
<v Speaker 2>we have the technology to produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>abundant water.</v>

1556
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.390
<v Speaker 2>And abundant and greenery and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

1557
01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.233
<v Speaker 2>that's in abundant greenery is wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of reasons that keeps the </v>

1558
01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:02.170
<v Speaker 2>city's cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It captures carbon and um,</v>

1559
01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's just,</v>

1560
01:05:03.211 --> 01:05:04.044
<v Speaker 2>and it makes life more pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this idea where we all have to sort </v>

1561
01:05:05.911 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 2>of this austerity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this forest sacrifice,</v>

1562
01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 2>austerity really starts with an attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>on cheap,</v>

1563
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:13.950
<v Speaker 2>clean energy and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in particular on nuclear.</v>

1564
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Anything I needed to know a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social stuff with you.</v>

1565
01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I have a of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could probably figure</v>

1566
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1567
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Just buy everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1568
01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the government should </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide who gets married.</v>

1569
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:28.240
<v Speaker 3>We're good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mostly think that stuff has been a way</v>

1570
01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 3>to just drive us apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

1571
01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Trent is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trent does anything.</v>

1572
01:05:31.781 --> 01:05:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Transgender bathrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like one of the big issues facing</v>

1573
01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:35.140
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody does,</v>

1574
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:35.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1575
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:36.814
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think that people in North </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carolina or wherever that now you think </v>

1576
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a big issue there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1577
01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.740
<v Speaker 3>So I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1578
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.633
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to actually get to a place </v>

1579
01:05:43.781 --> 01:05:46.720
<v Speaker 3>where it's like we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the common good and not,</v>

1580
01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:47.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what effects this interest group or </v>

1581
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:51.550
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1582
01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:52.091
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1583
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:55.570
<v Speaker 3>I think that identity politics has just </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone really too far.</v>

1584
01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.150
<v Speaker 3>It's made us lose sense of who we are as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a people.</v>

1585
01:05:58.270 --> 01:05:59.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I feel like that might be the </v>

1586
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:02.290
<v Speaker 3>sentence we should end this on because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been looking,</v>

1587
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:03.124
<v Speaker 3>my whole audience says I've been looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>for somebody that sounded like a </v>

1588
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:07.720
<v Speaker 3>sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Democrat that I could,</v>

1589
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to want to support.</v>

1590
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1591
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:10.970
<v Speaker 3>real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1592
01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.853
<v Speaker 3>my former guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zoltan Istvan is also running for </v>

1593
01:06:14.411 --> 01:06:18.250
<v Speaker 3>California here as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he running well he's a transhumanist,</v>

1594
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.750
<v Speaker 3>technically a party that can run or is </v>
<v Speaker 3>he running as an independent do?</v>

1595
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:22.361
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

1596
01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's cool is that we have,</v>

1597
01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.040
<v Speaker 3>will told an open primary and so anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>can go for anybody.</v>

1598
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:28.143
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're Democrat you can go for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Republican and independent just means </v>

1599
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.070
<v Speaker 3>declined to state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1600
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:33.904
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1601
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.240
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you're gonna endorse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not talk about that after,</v>

1602
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:40.060
<v Speaker 3>but I had been looking for a Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I go,</v>

1603
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.290
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what demo.</v>

1604
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:44.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1605
01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:44.854
<v Speaker 3>And yet you're not ignoring the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll know because in some ways you </v>

1606
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:51.700
<v Speaker 3>go like it was the Democrats pre 1975 </v>
<v Speaker 3>that believed in the future.</v>

1607
01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:54.370
<v Speaker 3>The ones after that side kick away the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ladder.</v>

1608
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.353
<v Speaker 3>What's unforced scarcity and let nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else come and enjoy this beautiful </v>

1609
01:06:57.761 --> 01:07:00.100
<v Speaker 3>paradise that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's plenty of room,</v>

1610
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.983
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

1611
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:02.103
<v Speaker 3>this is a state I want to get back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>touch with the values of abundance and </v>

1612
01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:08.530
<v Speaker 3>opportunity and an openness that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been shot and not.</v>

1613
01:07:08.531 --> 01:07:10.900
<v Speaker 3>And not just by the left either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think by both sides.</v>

1614
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:11.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well listen,</v>

1615
01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:14.050
<v Speaker 3>it's been a pleasure talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck on the campaign.</v>
