00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Bernardino,</v>

2
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brussels,</v>

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.053
<v Speaker 1>it seems not a day goes by without </v>
<v Speaker 1>another murderous assault on innocent </v>

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:09.864
<v Speaker 1>civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last Sunday bore witness to one of the </v>

5
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>most horrific attacks in recent memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Taliban affiliated group,</v>

6
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to park in Lahore,</v>

7
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.174
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing scores of women and children </v>

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.293
<v Speaker 1>celebrating the Easter holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These attacks only seem to be getting </v>

9
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>more brazen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more coordinated,</v>

10
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:27.534
<v Speaker 1>and more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People all over Europe are worried and </v>

11
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:31.224
<v Speaker 1>with good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems governments all throughout the </v>

12
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:34.464
<v Speaker 1>European continent had been ill prepared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with the growing threat of </v>

13
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>radical Islamic terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please note,</v>

14
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:45.501
<v Speaker 1>I once again said radical Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism and not all Muslims.</v>

15
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I think I've done that once or twice </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>This distinction is becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly exhausting to have to point</v>

17
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:53.844
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one I continue to make </v>

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many on the right refuse to separate the</v>

19
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.244
<v Speaker 1>nominal average person from the radicals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many on the left refuse to </v>

20
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge there are a few of us who do</v>
<v Speaker 1>make that distinction over and over.</v>

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.263
<v Speaker 1>While I've now conceded that the far </v>
<v Speaker 1>left will never accept any good faith </v>

22
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:13.854
<v Speaker 1>critique of Islam and will always excuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes even endorse it's </v>

23
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:18.024
<v Speaker 1>terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that many good people are waking </v>

24
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:21.324
<v Speaker 1>up to this nonsense every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the themes the rubin </v>

25
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:24.954
<v Speaker 1>report has been all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm glad to say that we're ahead of </v>

26
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>the curve on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one more time.</v>

27
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:34.431
<v Speaker 1>It is radical Islamists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a subset of people who believe in Islam,</v>

28
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>who are blowing up airports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trains,</v>

29
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.483
<v Speaker 1>and parks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care whether the people they </v>

30
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>murder are men or women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandparents or children,</v>

31
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:44.364
<v Speaker 1>black or white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to sow chaos and destruction </v>

32
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>in the name of their religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take my word for it by the way,</v>

33
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:51.474
<v Speaker 1>read the statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jihadists issue after each terror </v>

34
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:54.864
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these statements are all filled with </v>

35
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:57.144
<v Speaker 1>religious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quoting doctrine to kill infidels and </v>

36
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>nonbelievers.</v>

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>This is a good time to remind people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again what a religion is.</v>

38
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.683
<v Speaker 1>It is a set of ideas or religion isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>built into you like your sex or your </v>

39
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:16.641
<v Speaker 1>color or religion is just a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas only made of reality by people who</v>

40
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>practice it's beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any set of ideas is worthy of critique.</v>

41
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Whether these ideas are religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political or personal,</v>

42
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>so if you would be against throwing gays</v>
<v Speaker 1>off of roofs,</v>

43
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>making women wear burkas and treating </v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities as second class citizens.</v>

44
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>If a political party had those ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>its platform,</v>

45
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.510
<v Speaker 1>then you must be against those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a religion has them in its doctrine</v>

46
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.773
<v Speaker 1>and for the billionth time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't mean you should be bigoted </v>

47
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.363
<v Speaker 1>against all people who practice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith because there are a multitude of </v>

48
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>ways of being part of any faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it does mean however,</v>

49
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:56.334
<v Speaker 1>is that at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be against the ideas that you </v>

50
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>would be against if they came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else besides religion.</v>

51
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.983
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be much braver than just </v>

52
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.534
<v Speaker 1>being against bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should impact stand for good ideas </v>

53
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>or one day the violence you silently </v>
<v Speaker 1>condone will be at your doorstep.</v>

54
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>This is why the regressive left is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

55
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.014
<v Speaker 1>They've tricked decent people with good </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions into thinking that they're </v>

56
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>legitimate fears about terrorism or </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow bigoted or racist.</v>

57
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.773
<v Speaker 1>Not only is this pure nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has also fueled the rise of the </v>

58
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>right wing parties in Europe and Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump here in America.</v>

59
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.573
<v Speaker 1>The ideas of the regressive left have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone from wrong to malicious screaming </v>

60
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>about the crusades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time there is a jihadist attack is</v>

61
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.693
<v Speaker 1>pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focusing on one random atheist who </v>

62
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>committed a mass shooting is irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These regressives or trying to guilt and</v>

63
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>confuse you into accepting their </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards thinking.</v>

64
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.483
<v Speaker 1>We in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunately can't stand up to jihadist </v>

65
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>face to face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we absolutely must stand up to those</v>

66
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.264
<v Speaker 1>in our own societies who will excuse </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who would kill us due to their </v>

67
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>misguided sense of protecting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

68
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.363
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this disease of the mind which </v>

69
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.274
<v Speaker 1>regressive thinking really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the furthest thing from progressive </v>

70
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:19.564
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also is an added bonus for the </v>

71
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:22.714
<v Speaker 1>jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can kill scores of people and then </v>

72
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:25.624
<v Speaker 1>their Western allies will do mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics to excuse and explain why </v>

73
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more that jihad is,</v>

74
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:32.644
<v Speaker 1>say it's about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the regressive say it isn't </v>

75
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.570
<v Speaker 1>generally I find jihadists to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest than regressive,</v>

76
00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to take their word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is at a precarious point.</v>

77
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.743
<v Speaker 1>We can debate how much foreign policy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled jihadists or whether America's </v>

78
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>toppling of Saddam Hussein led to Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

79
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.544
<v Speaker 1>we can go much further back in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the British empire or the Ottoman </v>

80
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.743
<v Speaker 1>Empire even further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These blood feuds have gone on for </v>

81
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years and will probably go </v>
<v Speaker 1>on until after we're all gone.</v>

82
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.333
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will we in western societies now stand </v>

83
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>together and no longer accept excuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>for terror?</v>

84
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>If you feel the need to make an excuse </v>
<v Speaker 1>when a bomb goes off in a Paris theater,</v>

85
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>you're inviting terrorism to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>farmer's market.</v>

86
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:18.814
<v Speaker 1>In Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will always have a grievance and </v>

87
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:22.204
<v Speaker 1>if you tell them that it's an acceptable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to murder innocent because of your </v>

88
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>western guilt or misguided sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

89
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>then you are condemning yourself to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world where there are no rules.</v>

90
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>We will all live between terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill us and Authoritarians who</v>

91
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>will promise us safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a false choice,</v>

92
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's exactly where we are headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If good people won't stand up.</v>

93
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:44.584
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how many jihadists watched </v>

94
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure many good and decent</v>

95
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.491
<v Speaker 1>people do start calling out this </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressive thinking in your own world,</v>

96
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>stopping being cowed by false cries of </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism or bigotry.</v>

97
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:02.771
<v Speaker 1>Start beating their self flagellation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the truth about why Western society</v>

98
00:06:03.481 --> 00:06:04.314
<v Speaker 1>is good.</v>

99
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.080
<v Speaker 1>The Islam is earned bed with liars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressive conmen.</v>

100
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Their ideas will spread faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't wake up now and if you think</v>

101
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>this is a job for someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this evil alliance has already won.</v>

102
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know we need more vocal allies.</v>

103
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>One such ally is my guest this week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Julie Lunars,</v>

104
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Julie's a terrorism expert and director </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Human Security Center in London.</v>

105
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>She's on the front lines of calling out </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical Islam for the danger that it is.</v>

106
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to talking to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>about some difficult topics and maybe </v>

107
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll even ask her about those pesky </v>
<v Speaker 1>crusade.</v>

108
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.333
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're still upset about the </v>

109
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Crusades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happened a thousand years ago,</v>

110
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>then you should be at least equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset about the ones happening.</v>

111
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Julie Lynn,</v>

112
00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:55.654
<v Speaker 1>ours is the executive director of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Human Security Center and a principal </v>

113
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:03.100
<v Speaker 1>consultant to the European Parliament </v>
<v Speaker 1>intergroup on religious freedom.</v>

114
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Julie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the show.</v>

115
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 2>So good to beat him.</v>

116
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.603
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really excited to talk to you </v>

117
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:10.564
<v Speaker 1>because I've been following you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter for probably three years or so </v>

118
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.183
<v Speaker 1>and you've really been ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>curve on calling out Islamist extremist </v>

119
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.393
<v Speaker 1>terror or Islamic extremists terror or </v>
<v Speaker 1>jihadist terror or whatever phrase you </v>

120
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 1>want to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All let you break down some phrases.</v>

121
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.563
<v Speaker 1>You've been ahead of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the people that when I see </v>

122
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>with the things that you tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like,</v>

123
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.030
<v Speaker 1>she gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She understands it.</v>

124
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.560
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's start.</v>

125
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 1>What brought you to this spot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you get involved in being one of</v>

126
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:42.820
<v Speaker 1>the people that studies this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that talks about it,</v>

127
00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:43.750
<v Speaker 1>that consulted about it?</v>

128
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 2>When I read my first book on politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 12,</v>

129
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 2>and I know that probably makes me sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a complete geek.</v>

130
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.513
<v Speaker 2>I read my first book on politics when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was 12 about the conflict in Ireland </v>

131
00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.743
<v Speaker 2>about Northern Ireland and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in why people were healing </v>

132
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.813
<v Speaker 2>for their belief and for their ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course Ireland was more about </v>

133
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 2>national terrorism rather than religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism.</v>

134
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a religious component </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that you have,</v>

135
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.873
<v Speaker 2>you had the IRA on the one hand that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept clinic and you had the Uda and the </v>

136
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:23.350
<v Speaker 2>other power metallic power monetary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

137
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.120
<v Speaker 2>organizations that were Protestant or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other items.</v>

138
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how I got interested in,</v>

139
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 2>in conflict and white people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing in holiness and people for their</v>

140
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then two years later,</v>

141
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 happens and I report in at</v>

142
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 2>the time I remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acid acid was yesterday.</v>

143
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in school that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at home.</v>

144
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I was ill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting on the couch,</v>

145
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:49.694
<v Speaker 2>I was watching random television and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly this horrific images it pay it </v>

146
00:08:55.171 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 2>on my screen and obviously my first </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction was this was a terrible,</v>

147
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 2>terrible tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an accident.</v>

148
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 2>But the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second plane hit the towers,</v>

149
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody knew that whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was and that the time,</v>

150
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:13.060
<v Speaker 2>obviously we were still lacking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric to describe what just happened.</v>

151
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.933
<v Speaker 2>I realized that this was a game changer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world would never be the same </v>

152
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is true.</v>

153
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean the world was never the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>again after 9:11</v>

154
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.653
<v Speaker 2>and an obviously Afghanistan happened in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq happened and when we went into </v>

155
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 16 at the time.</v>

156
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:32.904
<v Speaker 2>And I think that was really the moment I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would describe as my awakening in the </v>

157
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 2>sense that I realized we were not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting the enemy from the outside,</v>

158
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 2>but also the enemy within.</v>

159
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.353
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking about the people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>post a wolf a perfectly legitimate </v>

160
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more everything's strategic reasons.</v>

161
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the people who </v>

162
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.803
<v Speaker 2>hijacked the antiwar movement and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were happy to call George George W dot </v>

163
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:01.514
<v Speaker 2>Bush and Tony Blair war criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while at the same time turning around </v>

164
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 2>and embracing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come as a terrorist organization,</v>

165
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.143
<v Speaker 2>had prejudice genocide against the Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people like George Galloway who was </v>

166
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:13.854
<v Speaker 2>on record praising Saddam Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some courage strings in project </v>

167
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 2>finishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the moment when I realized,</v>

168
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.993
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really have a problem and we need to </v>

169
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:25.014
<v Speaker 2>talk about this.</v>

170
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really want to dive into that </v>

171
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 1>because it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so related to everything we've been</v>

172
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 1>talking about here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of moral confusion that people</v>

173
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:33.774
<v Speaker 1>seem to have in a lot of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately does seem to be on the </v>

174
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 1>left and the right's got plenty of moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion itself.</v>

175
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

176
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 1>we seem to see a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left.</v>

177
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.413
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you were young around the </v>

178
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 1>time that nine slash 11 happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little older than you.</v>

179
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in New York City at the time and</v>

180
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:49.764
<v Speaker 1>of course I had studied politics before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course it was a defining moment </v>

181
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>for me and for literally millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people as well.</v>

182
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all that happens.</v>

183
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>And then when did you actually start </v>
<v Speaker 1>working in this field and really sort of</v>

184
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 1>talking about this publicly and making </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your,</v>

185
00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:06.684
<v Speaker 1>your life's work?</v>

186
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.773
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually started writing a personal </v>

187
00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:15.731
<v Speaker 2>blog at the time the war in Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and I talked about it a lot.</v>

188
00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:16.934
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was the first thing I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about publicly a lot about the </v>

189
00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:22.040
<v Speaker 2>reasons why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though,</v>

190
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.923
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always had great respect for the </v>

191
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Speaker 2>people who opposed the war for perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate reasons that I.</v>

192
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.593
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was also a more legitimate case </v>

193
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.300
<v Speaker 2>for the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

194
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.583
<v Speaker 2>look at the torture chambers and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps and the genocide </v>

195
00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:39.940
<v Speaker 2>against the Kurds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a,</v>

196
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.340
<v Speaker 2>a former Kaddish president who once said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Iraq was a concentration camp above</v>

197
00:11:46.221 --> 00:11:49.070
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>above ground and a mass grave beneath.</v>

198
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.160
<v Speaker 2>And that was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the worst dictatorships on</v>

199
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.023
<v Speaker 2>earth and that's when I really got </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in this debate and was exposed </v>

200
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:58.324
<v Speaker 2>to dwight a public and that was also the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time really when people started </v>

201
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 2>attacking me for my views.</v>

202
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

203
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.810
<v Speaker 1>when people talk to you about the Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 1>war now,</v>

204
00:12:06.811 --> 00:12:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meme in America is that,</v>

205
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had we not toppled George had George W </v>

206
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.320
<v Speaker 1>had we not topple George W Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George W Bush,</v>

207
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

208
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.623
<v Speaker 1>not toppled Saddam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ultimately had we not gone into </v>

209
00:12:21.691 --> 00:12:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Iraq that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have,</v>

210
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.710
<v Speaker 1>that isis wouldn't be here basically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

211
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.870
<v Speaker 1>is the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

212
00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:30.780
<v Speaker 1>as I've talked to some experts in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are saying,</v>

213
00:12:30.781 --> 00:12:31.614
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saddam,</v>

214
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.560
<v Speaker 1>as you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing some pretty horrific things.</v>

215
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:35.603
<v Speaker 1>So despite knowing now that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't weapons of mass destruction or </v>

216
00:12:38.401 --> 00:12:41.550
<v Speaker 1>at least that we never found them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you still in your mind,</v>

217
00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:45.270
<v Speaker 1>do you feel that that what we did was </v>
<v Speaker 1>still a moral case and what you guys did</v>

218
00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:46.320
<v Speaker 1>as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously,</v>

219
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Tony Blair had something to do with it.</v>

221
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still believe,</v>

222
00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I still believe after everything that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was right to,</v>

223
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.883
<v Speaker 2>to topple this regime and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of some of the things that people </v>

224
00:12:57.271 --> 00:12:59.360
<v Speaker 2>were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we shouldn't intervene,</v>

225
00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:00.194
<v Speaker 2>like at least Saddam Hussein contains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran for me really never was a moral </v>

226
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.730
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot contain one dictatorship with</v>

227
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:10.470
<v Speaker 2>a theocratic regime and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

228
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.540
<v Speaker 2>for the curb it was a liberation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

229
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:13.374
<v Speaker 2>look at Kurdistan today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraqi Kurdistan as a beacon of hope in </v>

230
00:13:16.771 --> 00:13:18.780
<v Speaker 2>the entire region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

231
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I obviously,</v>

232
00:13:20.971 --> 00:13:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I obviously I'm acknowledged that we did</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's terribly wrong,</v>

233
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:26.634
<v Speaker 2>which led to bloodshed and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dismantling of the Iraqi army to </v>

234
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.780
<v Speaker 2>debar certification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the big things really,</v>

235
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think were catastrophic and I'm really</v>

236
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:36.534
<v Speaker 2>happy to admit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't change the fact for me </v>

237
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.210
<v Speaker 2>that this was a genocidal dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

238
00:13:42.211 --> 00:13:43.044
<v Speaker 2>he committed a crime of all crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety five percent of Kurdish villages </v>

239
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.290
<v Speaker 2>were exposed to chemical weapons during </v>
<v Speaker 2>the DNF pumpkins pain.</v>

240
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.770
<v Speaker 2>And that is still the reason why I still</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe after everything,</v>

241
00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:57.000
<v Speaker 2>that it was the right thing to do.</v>

242
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not even to talk about what </v>

243
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:01.530
<v Speaker 1>he was doing to dissidence and free </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers and secular,</v>

244
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.373
<v Speaker 1>secularism,</v>

245
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.420
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

246
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me a little bit about the type </v>

247
00:14:08.821 --> 00:14:11.040
<v Speaker 1>of work that you do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

248
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.440
<v Speaker 1>what's actually the base work that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing?</v>

249
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do different things.</v>

250
00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>We work with the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a government,</v>

251
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 2>of course we work with non governmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations.</v>

252
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 2>We've worked with media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we work with the public and we do public</v>

253
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.290
<v Speaker 2>outreach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

254
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.153
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we currently </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is we're working with a European </v>

255
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Parliament intergroup on religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and um,</v>

256
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.740
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing for them.</v>

257
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:36.574
<v Speaker 2>Basically it's a once a year we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the worst violators of </v>

258
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:41.554
<v Speaker 2>religious freedom across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is really old continent from </v>

259
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Latin America to Asia to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>

260
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Africa.</v>

261
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at the sources of persecution,</v>

262
00:14:55.701 --> 00:15:00.701
<v Speaker 2>we look at why religious minorities in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that particular country are targeted and</v>

263
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 2>by whom they are targeted and what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do to help these people.</v>

264
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who's doing most of the targeting?</v>

265
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.771
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

266
00:15:13.771 --> 00:15:14.720
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a,</v>

267
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 2>it is a phenomenon and affect all </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries across all continents really.</v>

268
00:15:20.551 --> 00:15:24.660
<v Speaker 2>And it also affects all religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you have a,</v>

269
00:15:24.661 --> 00:15:25.800
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

270
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.480
<v Speaker 2>the brutal persecution of Muslims in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Burma by Buddhist extremists.</v>

271
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.343
<v Speaker 2>And do you have the persecution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims by Christian minutia and the </v>

272
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Central African Republic or you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

273
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.720
<v Speaker 2>you have the persecution of Christians </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Hindu nationalists in India,</v>

274
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.243
<v Speaker 2>but the vast majority of religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>persecution we see in the world today </v>

275
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.710
<v Speaker 2>has some kind of relation to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion of Islam,</v>

276
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.760
<v Speaker 2>whether it's by a state actor or a non </v>
<v Speaker 2>state actor.</v>

277
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I had a feeling that's what you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say.</v>

278
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:01.184
<v Speaker 1>So because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the good guys in this case and we </v>

279
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>try to separate people from ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you guys,</v>

280
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 1>when you're studying this and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning about this,</v>

281
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>how do you separate what is done in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of religion in the name of doctrine</v>

282
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 1>versus just the geo political realities </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground?</v>

283
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.010
<v Speaker 2>When I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

284
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.111
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we looked,</v>

285
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:24.944
<v Speaker 2>for instance at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the law of the country and the </v>

286
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:27.644
<v Speaker 2>constitution of the country and what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>will find at many of these countries is </v>

287
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 2>that the constitution in itself already </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminates against minorities.</v>

288
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president of the country can only be</v>

289
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:39.734
<v Speaker 2>Muslim and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is of course not just something </v>

290
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:46.214
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is purely decided on religious </v>

291
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 2>grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a strategic decision,</v>

292
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:50.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they want to,</v>

293
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.670
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep to themselves,</v>

294
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.330
<v Speaker 2>but then you also have completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrational persecution of minorities who</v>

295
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 2>can't do any harm whatsoever to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state because they are a tiny minorities</v>

296
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 2>and they are deprived of all their </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

297
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.213
<v Speaker 2>And that is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's no longer strategic and when </v>

298
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:12.470
<v Speaker 2>it really comes down to religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrine.</v>

299
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 2>And I'm talking for instance about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ahmadiyya Muslims,</v>

300
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.250
<v Speaker 2>the values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

301
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.400
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Sunni Muslim states often does she,</v>

302
00:17:20.401 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

303
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 2>that is both related to religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enter your politics are often,</v>

304
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:25.694
<v Speaker 2>it's also a mixture of both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very difficult to tell what it </v>

305
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:31.640
<v Speaker 2>is for political or religious reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are being persecuted.</v>

306
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that definitely is a problem that</v>

307
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:35.864
<v Speaker 2>we have with religious inspired </v>
<v Speaker 2>persecution of minorities in the Muslim </v>

308
00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:42.134
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

309
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.840
<v Speaker 1>So I know you do a lot of work with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Kurds.</v>

310
00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:47.580
<v Speaker 1>We've been talking a bit about the Kurds</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

311
00:17:47.581 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly under reported,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the states.</v>

312
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.303
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they the best example of a </v>

313
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 1>persecuted minority because they're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority in at least four countries.</v>

314
00:17:58.081 --> 00:17:58.914
<v Speaker 1>They never got their state when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing was carved up and they were </v>

315
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>basically treated incredibly poorly by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>

316
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>

317
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.193
<v Speaker 1>and Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are they really the best example for </v>

318
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you when you were talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff?</v>

319
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.563
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was joking a couple of weeks ago that </v>

321
00:18:14.001 --> 00:18:14.834
<v Speaker 2>I should get myself a tee shirt saying I</v>
<v Speaker 2>supported the cats before it became </v>

322
00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:19.154
<v Speaker 2>fashionable because now be know a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk about them and don't get me </v>

323
00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:23.300
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

324
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.133
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really pleased that people are finally </v>

325
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:26.803
<v Speaker 2>giving them the attention and exposure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these wonderful and openminded and </v>

326
00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:35.360
<v Speaker 2>largely peaceful and brave people </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserve.</v>

327
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.050
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

328
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:37.884
<v Speaker 2>I honestly believed that probably since </v>
<v Speaker 2>the formation of the state of Israel in </v>

329
00:18:43.161 --> 00:18:46.420
<v Speaker 2>the 19 forties at what we're seeing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kurds,</v>

330
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.293
<v Speaker 2>the struggle for self determination is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the most promising democracy </v>

331
00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:55.840
<v Speaker 2>experiment in the Middle East because </v>
<v Speaker 2>low had one,</v>

332
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 2>the curts are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Iraquis can,</v>

333
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.063
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take Iraqi Kurdistan as an </v>

334
00:19:00.381 --> 00:19:01.214
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just a semi autonomous region and </v>

335
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:03.723
<v Speaker 2>in the north of the country they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own president and prime minister </v>

336
00:19:06.171 --> 00:19:09.600
<v Speaker 2>in Parliament and the passion of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is we just eat the,</v>

337
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:11.690
<v Speaker 2>the army of off the Kurdistan region.</v>

338
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have taken hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people from Syria,</v>

339
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.540
<v Speaker 2>from Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>persecuted by the Islamic state,</v>

340
00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:21.374
<v Speaker 2>hunted body outside regime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including tens of thousands of </v>

341
00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Christians who otherwise would have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughtered or at least enslaved.</v>

342
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.880
<v Speaker 2>They were able to celebrate Easter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>safety and peace.</v>

343
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.790
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just that they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>providing basic needs to these people.</v>

344
00:19:37.791 --> 00:19:38.624
<v Speaker 2>They are going a step further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are actually trying to support the </v>

345
00:19:43.371 --> 00:19:45.950
<v Speaker 2>rights of religious minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And last year,</v>

346
00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:46.784
<v Speaker 2>the Kurdistan region of Iraq did </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I feel is absolutely </v>

347
00:19:50.331 --> 00:19:51.164
<v Speaker 2>unique and historic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They decided to give to each of the </v>

348
00:19:55.131 --> 00:19:55.964
<v Speaker 2>minority minority communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious minority communities in Iraqi </v>

349
00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Kurdistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the official representation.</v>

350
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.870
<v Speaker 2>So they all have their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>representatives now and not just one.</v>

351
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the Muslims and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians.</v>

352
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.143
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also the Jews and the buys and to show </v>

353
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:13.743
<v Speaker 2>that the shoebox and and Ahmadiyya </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims were persecuted all across the </v>

354
00:20:17.751 --> 00:20:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

355
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.673
<v Speaker 2>these are not just token appointment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are really doing work that </v>

356
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.843
<v Speaker 2>the first Jewish represented just comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>back from a visit from Israel where he </v>

357
00:20:29.481 --> 00:20:30.314
<v Speaker 2>met with lawmakers and always trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really find ways to build bridges </v>

358
00:20:33.951 --> 00:20:34.784
<v Speaker 2>between Israel and Kurdistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is absolutely unique in that </v>

359
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:39.044
<v Speaker 2>region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's fascinating if you think about </v>

360
00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:45.620
<v Speaker 2>the defect that just miles away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Erbil where the,</v>

361
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:50.290
<v Speaker 2>where the Kurdish parliament sets the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage is,</v>

362
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

363
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:52.930
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in place.</v>

364
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.823
<v Speaker 2>And that is of course the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental manifestation of radical </v>

365
00:20:58.271 --> 00:20:59.104
<v Speaker 2>Islam</v>

366
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.200
<v Speaker 1>had a few weeks ago who is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

367
00:21:03.201 --> 00:21:04.034
<v Speaker 1>the Krg rep to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking about that border </v>

368
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.073
<v Speaker 1>and how close everything is and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really crazy because basically the </v>

369
00:21:14.091 --> 00:21:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Kurds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the peshmerga,</v>

370
00:21:15.471 --> 00:21:20.471
<v Speaker 1>they are fighting the isis on one side </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're also fighting Turkey on</v>

371
00:21:21.141 --> 00:21:23.420
<v Speaker 1>the other side and Turkey as a NATO </v>
<v Speaker 1>ally.</v>

372
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain a little bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity there?</v>

373
00:21:25.611 --> 00:21:26.444
<v Speaker 1>Because it's really complex because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also Kurds in Turkey and they </v>

374
00:21:29.031 --> 00:21:32.330
<v Speaker 1>have a political party and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to negotiate with Turkey.</v>

375
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:33.830
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound like it's going that </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

376
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.013
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to make a distinction between </v>

377
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.360
<v Speaker 2>the Kurds in Iraq and the cat's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

378
00:21:39.361 --> 00:21:40.194
<v Speaker 2>I ended up the text and the cuts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey and the cuts and in Iran because </v>

379
00:21:44.341 --> 00:21:49.341
<v Speaker 2>they all have different goals and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>all have different relationships with.</v>

380
00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:50.914
<v Speaker 2>With Turkey as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The relationship between the Kurdistan </v>

381
00:21:52.951 --> 00:21:56.910
<v Speaker 2>region of Iraq with Turkey is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>not that bad.</v>

382
00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.093
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the problem with the PK K in in </v>

383
00:22:01.261 --> 00:22:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is in for many years now.</v>

384
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.473
<v Speaker 2>I'm trapped in a brutal conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Turkey stage and of course the PKK </v>

385
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.293
<v Speaker 2>is allied to the GPJ in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now controls almost the entire </v>

386
00:22:16.531 --> 00:22:21.531
<v Speaker 2>border with Turkey and Turkey is bonding</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kurds,</v>

387
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.203
<v Speaker 2>the same people we are working with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US is working with to find Islamic </v>

388
00:22:27.631 --> 00:22:28.464
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we actually seeing is that the </v>

389
00:22:29.941 --> 00:22:33.810
<v Speaker 2>US net coalition is at war with itself.</v>

390
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

391
00:22:34.611 --> 00:22:35.444
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems like this is now an </v>

392
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:38.363
<v Speaker 1>open secret that this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Kurds are fighting isis on the </v>

393
00:22:41.581 --> 00:22:42.414
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're basically the only fighting </v>

394
00:22:43.471 --> 00:22:47.850
<v Speaker 1>force on the ground fighting Isis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey is bombing them.</v>

395
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And we are a NATO ally with Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is this secret being allowed?</v>

396
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.023
<v Speaker 1>It's being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out and we're not doing anything </v>

397
00:22:55.321 --> 00:22:55.750
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

398
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Europe needs the cooperation of the</v>

399
00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Turkish state because of the refugee </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>

400
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.333
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey in many ways from the gateway </v>

401
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.763
<v Speaker 2>from Syria to Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they need to go on to play a play </v>

402
00:23:08.641 --> 00:23:09.474
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is one of the reasons why so </v>

403
00:23:10.831 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 2>many governments in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

404
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.033
<v Speaker 2>hesitant to criticize the Turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>government for the way they're treating </v>

405
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.200
<v Speaker 2>the cuts both in own country and also in</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

406
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 1>So Turkey basically is having their cake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eating it too,</v>

407
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 1>and that they're letting the fighters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>through Europe,</v>

408
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come from Europe,</v>

409
00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:30.844
<v Speaker 1>they go through Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go in and then Turkey is then </v>

410
00:23:33.241 --> 00:23:36.450
<v Speaker 1>bombing the Kurds because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrilled with the Kurds.</v>

411
00:23:36.451 --> 00:23:37.284
<v Speaker 1>So it's good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have to play ball with them </v>

412
00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:42.040
<v Speaker 1>because they're also the buffer zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it really,</v>

413
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:42.874
<v Speaker 1>that's like one of those cases where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can really see how complex this stuff </v>

414
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.124
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

415
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean basically what do you can say is </v>

416
00:23:48.401 --> 00:23:52.810
<v Speaker 2>that Turkey is more afraid of a Kurdish </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage than it is Islamic stage.</v>

417
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

418
00:23:54.911 --> 00:23:59.500
<v Speaker 2>if you look at that policy and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they react in the region,</v>

419
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.430
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's crystal clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

420
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.430
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't,</v>

421
00:24:03.431 --> 00:24:05.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't really deny that.</v>

422
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.270
<v Speaker 2>And I personally agree with you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

423
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.123
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely shameful that a NATO </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner is bonding with the group of </v>

424
00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 2>people that is most efficient in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting the Islamic state.</v>

425
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.793
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not condemning by any means the </v>

426
00:24:22.121 --> 00:24:25.580
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attacks that we've seen in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey by the PKK.</v>

427
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

428
00:24:27.431 --> 00:24:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Terrorism is ever justified against </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

429
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I con I rejected when you some extent is</v>

430
00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:33.184
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rejected when the IRA was doing that </v>

431
00:24:34.871 --> 00:24:37.810
<v Speaker 2>in Northern Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rejected when the PKK is doing that in</v>

432
00:24:37.811 --> 00:24:38.644
<v Speaker 2>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's more complex than just the PKK </v>

433
00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:42.064
<v Speaker 2>and the Turkeys state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this goes way beyond Turkey just </v>

434
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:45.723
<v Speaker 2>taking action against the PKK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really using this to sort of </v>

435
00:24:50.621 --> 00:24:55.621
<v Speaker 2>justify an entire crackdown on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Kurds within Turkey and the Kurds</v>

436
00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:56.734
<v Speaker 2>in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this basically goes hunting it hand </v>

437
00:24:58.901 --> 00:25:01.880
<v Speaker 2>in hand with an increased all three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

438
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.773
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism inside Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the crackdown on the </v>

439
00:25:05.711 --> 00:25:08.530
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech activists,</v>

440
00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.120
<v Speaker 2>this all goes hand in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the,</v>

441
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.350
<v Speaker 2>the cuts that being targeted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's freethinkers.</v>

442
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Everybody you to criticize President </v>
<v Speaker 2>Erdogan.</v>

443
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to back up to something that </v>

444
00:25:19.781 --> 00:25:20.614
<v Speaker 1>you said about the Kurds a moment ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've sent a representative to </v>

445
00:25:23.381 --> 00:25:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Israel and I know that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly some other sort of behind the</v>

446
00:25:27.101 --> 00:25:32.050
<v Speaker 1>scenes relationships there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does that sort of proved that at the</v>

447
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.210
<v Speaker 1>end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what religion people are,</v>

448
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really that having sort of the base</v>

449
00:25:37.121 --> 00:25:40.450
<v Speaker 1>human freedom and respect for minorities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things like that,</v>

450
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.660
<v Speaker 1>that that's what will make these </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries succeed or fail.</v>

451
00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:44.494
<v Speaker 1>It's not a coincidence that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that seem to fail are the </v>

452
00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:48.004
<v Speaker 1>least tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a relationship that should be </v>

453
00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:51.520
<v Speaker 1>nurtured further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

454
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

455
00:25:53.581 --> 00:25:56.220
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what would you say is absolutely</v>

456
00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:57.054
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cut are the best example because </v>

457
00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>let's not forget they are Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of are Muslims and yet</v>

458
00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:05.184
<v Speaker 2>they practice and if not that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inclusive and respectful to other </v>

459
00:26:09.421 --> 00:26:12.300
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is possible.</v>

460
00:26:12.301 --> 00:26:15.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not mutually exclusive to be Muslim</v>

461
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.700
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a person and be,</v>

462
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:18.534
<v Speaker 2>be open minded towards others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the coke have a long standing </v>

463
00:26:21.301 --> 00:26:25.710
<v Speaker 2>history and culture of tolerance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful coexistence.</v>

464
00:26:25.711 --> 00:26:26.730
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that way,</v>

465
00:26:26.731 --> 00:26:29.740
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids really are the best example and</v>

466
00:26:29.741 --> 00:26:34.741
<v Speaker 2>the beacon of hope and a region that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise drowning in blood and,</v>

467
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.450
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my mom,</v>

468
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also,</v>

469
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful thing because it shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that religions can,</v>

470
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.760
<v Speaker 1>don't always have to be their extremist </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>

471
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they're using street.</v>

472
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.423
<v Speaker 1>There are strategic reasons in that area</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they might want to partner up with </v>

473
00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Israel and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gets the religion out of it and it</v>

474
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 1>gets some of the Geo politics out of it.</v>

475
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.623
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's quite interesting if you go to </v>

476
00:26:58.391 --> 00:27:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Kurdistan and he talked to two people </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Israel and about America,</v>

477
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.233
<v Speaker 2>you don't get this hostility that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in many Arab countries where they </v>

478
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.420
<v Speaker 2>perceive and Israel and America is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst of everything.</v>

479
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.583
<v Speaker 2>And now we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a very different attitude in </v>

480
00:27:15.881 --> 00:27:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Kurdistan where they are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel and looking at American.</v>

481
00:27:19.361 --> 00:27:21.490
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at our science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

482
00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave aside politics for a moment,</v>

483
00:27:23.381 --> 00:27:24.970
<v Speaker 2>look and everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.730
<v Speaker 2>the lutheranism that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the freedoms that we have,</v>

485
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.800
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

486
00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:33.070
<v Speaker 2>has the right to do whatever they say in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they admire,</v>

487
00:27:33.071 --> 00:27:36.070
<v Speaker 2>that they inspire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they inspire to be like us,</v>

488
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.800
<v Speaker 2>not in the sense that they were giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>up their own culture,</v>

489
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.083
<v Speaker 2>but having an open minded view of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that is compatible with the 21st </v>

490
00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:46.803
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>

491
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

492
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.450
<v Speaker 1>So let's shift we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

493
00:27:49.451 --> 00:27:50.284
<v Speaker 1>we could spend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's so complex that we could spend </v>

494
00:27:51.791 --> 00:27:52.624
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the hour talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's shift to some of the other </v>

495
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:55.924
<v Speaker 1>stuff going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously there was the attack in </v>

496
00:27:58.571 --> 00:28:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Brussels last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few days ago.</v>

497
00:28:01.811 --> 00:28:02.644
<v Speaker 1>There was the attack in Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that these things are </v>

498
00:28:06.911 --> 00:28:11.560
<v Speaker 1>starting to become more frequent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just a feeling that now,</v>

499
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw something this week that they're </v>

500
00:28:13.421 --> 00:28:18.421
<v Speaker 1>saying that there's probably 400 isis </v>
<v Speaker 1>operatives in Europe ready to partake in</v>

501
00:28:19.091 --> 00:28:22.330
<v Speaker 1>whatever the next event is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

502
00:28:22.331 --> 00:28:25.400
<v Speaker 1>so can you just break down Brussels a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit because I know for,</v>

503
00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.690
<v Speaker 1>for weeks before people were saying this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about to happen.</v>

504
00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.853
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they obviously had good intelligence </v>

505
00:28:31.151 --> 00:28:34.240
<v Speaker 1>and it still happened and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the really scary part is.</v>

506
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously what happened in Russia</v>

507
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.540
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was not up to me at least,</v>

508
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:44.590
<v Speaker 2>it was not a surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

509
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.773
<v Speaker 2>it was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew that and you were just saying </v>

510
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:53.130
<v Speaker 2>that obviously we had good intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you have to distinguish the Abbott,</v>

511
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.450
<v Speaker 2>but because obviously the Belgian </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorities didn't have the intelligence</v>

512
00:28:57.451 --> 00:28:58.284
<v Speaker 2>that they were supposed to be having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is a problem that people like </v>

513
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:02.154
<v Speaker 2>myself who have raised for quite a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time now that the very weak nature of </v>

514
00:29:06.421 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 2>the Belgian state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

515
00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:08.754
<v Speaker 2>it's sometimes even problematic to speak</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Belgium as a state because it's so </v>

516
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:17.750
<v Speaker 2>torn apart in eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the state of the Belgian,</v>

517
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:19.794
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secret services and intelligence </v>

518
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:24.000
<v Speaker 2>services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are inequipped.</v>

519
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:24.883
<v Speaker 2>They are massively undecided and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply don't have the resources to </v>

520
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.903
<v Speaker 2>monitor all the people that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually supposed to be monitoring </v>

521
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:38.030
<v Speaker 2>because let's not forget that Belgium </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the highest percentage per capita of</v>

522
00:29:38.691 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 2>foreign fighters do some estate in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire European Union and it's no,</v>

523
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:44.524
<v Speaker 2>it's no coincidence that these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have chosen Belgium as a place where </v>

524
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:49.684
<v Speaker 2>they can gather and plan and carry out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>text because of course there are well </v>

525
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 2>aware of all these weaknesses that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>just missed it and you know,</v>

526
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:04.051
<v Speaker 2>by failing their own people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgium is putting everyone else at risk</v>

527
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.290
<v Speaker 2>because obviously these people do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate nation states.</v>

528
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in France,</v>

529
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.903
<v Speaker 2>someone in Germany or the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just as much an enemy to these </v>

530
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:19.060
<v Speaker 2>people as the people of Belgium and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can openly cross borders.</v>

531
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have the Schengen area in,</v>

532
00:30:21.391 --> 00:30:22.224
<v Speaker 2>in Europe where people can cross borders</v>
<v Speaker 2>without showing that passport or a new </v>

533
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:26.554
<v Speaker 2>form of identification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we're seeing the </v>

534
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:29.854
<v Speaker 2>terrorism that we see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also why we see a network </v>

535
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:35.350
<v Speaker 2>really spamming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From Paris to Belgium.</v>

536
00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:36.184
<v Speaker 2>And this was the first time ever that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one terrorist cell managed to attack to </v>

537
00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 2>European capitals?</v>

538
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear any?</v>

539
00:30:45.241 --> 00:30:46.074
<v Speaker 1>I saw a story that I saw in one place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I didn't see a picked up </v>

540
00:30:49.171 --> 00:30:51.570
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if this is not true,</v>

541
00:30:51.571 --> 00:30:54.450
<v Speaker 1>please stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I heard that when they were going to</v>

542
00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:57.090
<v Speaker 1>arrest the guy in Belgium just a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

543
00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.253
<v Speaker 1>that apparently that in his community </v>
<v Speaker 1>that about 200 people we're trying to </v>

544
00:31:01.711 --> 00:31:02.544
<v Speaker 1>stop the police and the anti terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from arresting and they were </v>

545
00:31:05.401 --> 00:31:08.250
<v Speaker 1>throwing bottles at the police and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of stuff.</v>

546
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about that and is it being </v>
<v Speaker 1>reported in Europe at all?</v>

547
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:16.340
<v Speaker 2>I heard about that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some media outlets reported that</v>

548
00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:20.450
<v Speaker 2>there were riots taking place when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested him and to be honest,</v>

549
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.443
<v Speaker 2>it's not surprising to me at all because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand these people </v>

550
00:31:24.981 --> 00:31:25.814
<v Speaker 2>don't work in isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are embedded in communities and if </v>

551
00:31:28.911 --> 00:31:29.744
<v Speaker 2>you look at these notorious </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods like molenbeek and </v>

552
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:33.893
<v Speaker 2>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the terrorists that are </v>

553
00:31:36.231 --> 00:31:37.064
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the wider society in which they </v>

554
00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:40.664
<v Speaker 2>live who may be on not jihad this </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and who not engaged in </v>

555
00:31:44.571 --> 00:31:48.440
<v Speaker 2>violence themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who are at least to a certain degree</v>

556
00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:49.274
<v Speaker 2>described to the Islamist ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which brings me to the overall problem </v>

557
00:31:53.241 --> 00:31:54.074
<v Speaker 2>really that it's not good enough to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a problem with a fringe </v>

558
00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:01.670
<v Speaker 2>because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there there is only a tiny minority that</v>

559
00:32:01.671 --> 00:32:02.504
<v Speaker 2>carries out violent attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a lot of minority that </v>

560
00:32:07.641 --> 00:32:11.900
<v Speaker 2>subscribed to the Islamic world view and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an even larger minority,</v>

561
00:32:11.901 --> 00:32:12.734
<v Speaker 2>a significant minority that practices </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative Islam that is not </v>

562
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:18.973
<v Speaker 2>compatible with the modern world and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not talking a few hundred or a few </v>

563
00:32:22.911 --> 00:32:26.990
<v Speaker 2>thousand people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we are talking millions and even if</v>

564
00:32:26.991 --> 00:32:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you say that just one percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims in the world.</v>

565
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.033
<v Speaker 2>Do you hot it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are talking about 15 or 16 million </v>

566
00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:37.094
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean wrap your hand around for a </v>

567
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:40.304
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

568
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

569
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.553
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that many people like Sam </v>

570
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:46.023
<v Speaker 1>Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I've had on this show have gone out </v>

571
00:32:46.811 --> 00:32:47.644
<v Speaker 1>of their way to talk about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentric circles and you have the </v>

572
00:32:50.801 --> 00:32:51.634
<v Speaker 1>nominal people who don't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>care about religion or following </v>

573
00:32:55.211 --> 00:32:58.210
<v Speaker 1>doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it sort of extends outward from</v>

574
00:32:58.211 --> 00:32:59.330
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do,</v>

575
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.193
<v Speaker 1>what do we do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is where the conversation </v>

576
00:33:02.261 --> 00:33:03.094
<v Speaker 1>gets difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've obviously just laid out there </v>

577
00:33:05.531 --> 00:33:08.080
<v Speaker 1>that you don't think all Muslims are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this,</v>

578
00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.660
<v Speaker 1>but you do see a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

579
00:33:10.661 --> 00:33:13.180
<v Speaker 1>A certain amount of people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use violence.</v>

580
00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.300
<v Speaker 1>A certain amount of people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>condone that violence.</v>

581
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.313
<v Speaker 1>A certain amount of people are gonna see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it brewing in their communities and not </v>

582
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:21.970
<v Speaker 1>do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it just keeps.</v>

583
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like an onion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just more and more layers.</v>

584
00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:29.080
<v Speaker 1>So how do we in the West combat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're fighting,</v>

585
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.270
<v Speaker 1>we're fighting the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fighting them,</v>

586
00:33:31.271 --> 00:33:32.104
<v Speaker 1>and then we're fighting the people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our left who are trying to silence us </v>

587
00:33:34.451 --> 00:33:35.350
<v Speaker 1>from talking about it.</v>

588
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.463
<v Speaker 2>One good example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your show really because you equip </v>

589
00:33:41.381 --> 00:33:46.180
<v Speaker 2>people with the rhetoric to to engage in</v>
<v Speaker 2>just daily live in these debates as well</v>

590
00:33:46.181 --> 00:33:49.540
<v Speaker 2>and to make the distinction between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion of Islam,</v>

591
00:33:49.541 --> 00:33:50.374
<v Speaker 2>which is a set of eaves and Islamism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an ideology which partly </v>

592
00:33:54.941 --> 00:33:59.941
<v Speaker 2>derived from a particular interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the religion and jihadism,</v>

593
00:33:59.951 --> 00:34:03.790
<v Speaker 2>which Dennis sort of the violent </v>
<v Speaker 2>extension of Islam Islam.</v>

594
00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:04.624
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's first of all a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction that's very important to me </v>

595
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:12.160
<v Speaker 2>because it also makes it easier for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like ourselves to reject,</v>

596
00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:13.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>charges of racism and bigotry and </v>

597
00:34:15.671 --> 00:34:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia</v>

598
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:17.843
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get exhausted by making the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction though because it almost </v>

599
00:34:19.901 --> 00:34:23.620
<v Speaker 1>doesn't win you any friends on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's how I feel.</v>

600
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.060
<v Speaker 1>But I'll continue to do it.</v>

601
00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.703
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't really have another </v>

602
00:34:27.811 --> 00:34:28.591
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

603
00:34:28.591 --> 00:34:31.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean the other option would be to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

604
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:35.760
<v Speaker 2>to join Don Donald Trump's camp and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>generalize and stigmatize or Muslims and</v>

605
00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:37.890
<v Speaker 2>that's really not what I want to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>

606
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.003
<v Speaker 2>That is precisely why I'm not a bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a race because I don't want to </v>

607
00:34:42.451 --> 00:34:46.860
<v Speaker 2>engage in these generalizations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sweeping statements and brushing every,</v>

608
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:47.743
<v Speaker 2>everyone over the same Ta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that and that is why </v>

609
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:52.374
<v Speaker 2>I keep explaining to people there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between a religion and Islam </v>

610
00:34:55.951 --> 00:34:56.784
<v Speaker 2>is a religion like any other religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a set of beliefs and we should </v>

611
00:35:00.721 --> 00:35:01.554
<v Speaker 2>have the right to criticize particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs within the faith if they are </v>

612
00:35:06.511 --> 00:35:07.344
<v Speaker 2>harmful and incompatible with modern way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life and it was sometimes called </v>

613
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.343
<v Speaker 2>sometimes called Islam the virgin </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst faith because you are not </v>

614
00:35:17.911 --> 00:35:21.180
<v Speaker 2>allowed to touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are not allowed to touch virgin.</v>

615
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.193
<v Speaker 2>They are happy to discuss with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender inequality when it comes to </v>

616
00:35:25.621 --> 00:35:26.454
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox Judaism and they are quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to discuss with you bigoted views </v>

617
00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:33.570
<v Speaker 2>on the fundamentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian write about abortion and women</v>

618
00:35:33.571 --> 00:35:34.450
<v Speaker 2>and gay.</v>

619
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget about the crusades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Crusades,</v>

620
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:39.893
<v Speaker 2>what I say all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't forget what we did 200 years </v>

621
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.573
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know they talk about the persecution of </v>

622
00:35:46.431 --> 00:35:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Muslims in Burma by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Buddhist extremists and they're not.</v>

623
00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.713
<v Speaker 2>They don't hesitate to call them </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremists and make the religion and </v>

624
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:54.400
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

625
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the link to the religion of Buddhism.</v>

626
00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.140
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's off topic.</v>

627
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.890
<v Speaker 2>You are not allowed to touch Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment you touch Islam,</v>

628
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:04.783
<v Speaker 2>you're a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a racist no matter what </v>

629
00:36:06.621 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 2>distinction you're making between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and ideology and m and g,</v>

630
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:14.300
<v Speaker 2>how does him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a racist that very moment.</v>

631
00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:16.310
<v Speaker 2>You want to talk about Islam?</v>

632
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically you'll continue to make </v>

633
00:36:18.531 --> 00:36:20.930
<v Speaker 1>this distinction because we sort of have</v>
<v Speaker 1>no choice.</v>

634
00:36:20.931 --> 00:36:21.764
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how,</v>

635
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:22.723
<v Speaker 1>that's how I feel too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to hand it to the </v>

636
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.663
<v Speaker 1>far right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a good segue to a lot of </v>

637
00:36:27.111 --> 00:36:29.960
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in Europe right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned earlier that because of</v>

638
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.930
<v Speaker 1>the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

639
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're,</v>

640
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.970
<v Speaker 1>the people don't have to use passports </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go all over the place.</v>

641
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:39.440
<v Speaker 1>So this is why the ideology can spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's white people can,</v>

642
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.810
<v Speaker 1>can go from Paris to Brussels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

643
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.940
<v Speaker 1>so two questions here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is people seem to want.</v>

644
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to break up the EU altogether.</v>

645
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and secondly,</v>

646
00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about immigration as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

647
00:36:54.681 --> 00:36:56.300
<v Speaker 1>So why don't we start with the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>one?</v>

648
00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we see that there is a debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on everywhere in Europe about open</v>

649
00:37:01.731 --> 00:37:02.564
<v Speaker 2>borders because many people feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no longer an asset and rather I'm </v>

650
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.240
<v Speaker 2>aiding those people that we are trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to contain.</v>

651
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

652
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:13.814
<v Speaker 2>as a European myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always felt it was great and I could </v>

653
00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.950
<v Speaker 2>just cross the border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I lived in Germany,</v>

654
00:37:18.951 --> 00:37:19.784
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just crossed the border into the </v>

655
00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands or Belgium or France without</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to show my passport.</v>

656
00:37:25.161 --> 00:37:25.994
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is if you have a system </v>

657
00:37:28.671 --> 00:37:29.504
<v Speaker 2>like open borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also need adequate security to back </v>

658
00:37:32.781 --> 00:37:33.614
<v Speaker 2>this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what the Belgium example shows you </v>

659
00:37:36.651 --> 00:37:41.651
<v Speaker 2>is that right now we are not having the </v>
<v Speaker 2>security apparatus that can safeguard us</v>

660
00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.753
<v Speaker 2>was having open boarders because Belgium</v>
<v Speaker 2>is failing to contain the threat and </v>

661
00:37:49.431 --> 00:37:52.730
<v Speaker 2>that's what they are doing and have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing for a long time.</v>

662
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:56.600
<v Speaker 2>And these people can travel freely </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the entire European Union.</v>

663
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a little different with the UK </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to cross some water and</v>

664
00:37:59.661 --> 00:38:00.494
<v Speaker 2>it's more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but into France or Germany or the </v>

665
00:38:03.891 --> 00:38:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we all have,</v>

666
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.610
<v Speaker 2>we're having a problem and we have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

667
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.653
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not very partisan when it comes to </v>

668
00:38:10.581 --> 00:38:11.414
<v Speaker 2>dessert and tie a yes EU until bud bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that we have to honestly </v>

669
00:38:16.491 --> 00:38:20.210
<v Speaker 2>talk about the now your abilities of </v>
<v Speaker 2>open borders at the moment.</v>

670
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.020
<v Speaker 2>And that is true for terrorists as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>as it is for refugees.</v>

671
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:24.963
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the vetting process for the migrants </v>

672
00:38:28.001 --> 00:38:30.880
<v Speaker 1>and the immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the same in each country?</v>

673
00:38:30.881 --> 00:38:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Because if they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say they're coming through Greece,</v>

674
00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.470
<v Speaker 1>if Greece has more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

675
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.250
<v Speaker 1>processes by which they can get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then if you,</v>

676
00:38:39.251 --> 00:38:41.560
<v Speaker 1>once you're in Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can then get anywhere in Europe,</v>

677
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.573
<v Speaker 1>I could see why you would be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed if you were in France and Greece </v>

678
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:48.000
<v Speaker 1>had lead lacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

679
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to get people in.</v>

680
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is that all of these countries</v>

681
00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:53.964
<v Speaker 2>are actually overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cannot process all these people in </v>

682
00:38:57.181 --> 00:38:59.070
<v Speaker 2>time that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that day arriving.</v>

683
00:38:59.071 --> 00:38:59.904
<v Speaker 2>And the truth is also that many of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just throwing away their papers so </v>

684
00:39:02.641 --> 00:39:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you have no way to even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

685
00:39:05.401 --> 00:39:06.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check who they are,</v>

686
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:07.643
<v Speaker 2>where they're coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the truth they thought so that many </v>

687
00:39:10.321 --> 00:39:11.154
<v Speaker 2>of them actually not coming from Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also coming from countries like </v>

688
00:39:13.771 --> 00:39:14.604
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and Eritrea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like the biggest problem at </v>

689
00:39:18.691 --> 00:39:21.840
<v Speaker 2>the moment is that we are only treating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the symptoms.</v>

690
00:39:21.841 --> 00:39:25.980
<v Speaker 2>We are not treating the root cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what is the plan for Eritrea?</v>

691
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.533
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's talking about Eritrea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do about the </v>

692
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.313
<v Speaker 2>situation in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Eritrea to make sure that not more </v>

693
00:39:32.671 --> 00:39:33.504
<v Speaker 2>people that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have to look at these </v>

694
00:39:35.251 --> 00:39:36.084
<v Speaker 2>countries and the situation in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and we have to ask ourselves </v>

695
00:39:38.881 --> 00:39:39.714
<v Speaker 2>what can we do to change the situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground and to have people within </v>

696
00:39:42.931 --> 00:39:44.130
<v Speaker 2>their own region.</v>

697
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Because the truth is that even a notch </v>
<v Speaker 2>country like Germany,</v>

698
00:39:48.451 --> 00:39:53.451
<v Speaker 2>a welcoming country like Germany cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>take in all the people that need help.</v>

699
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.070
<v Speaker 2>And how would you explain to someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Libya that yes,</v>

700
00:39:59.071 --> 00:40:03.780
<v Speaker 2>we are taking in people from Syria and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eritrea and Afghanistan,</v>

701
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.010
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you Olivia,</v>

702
00:40:05.011 --> 00:40:07.770
<v Speaker 2>please stay away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't discriminate there.</v>

703
00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.500
<v Speaker 2>And the truth is that we cannot take in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people.</v>

704
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:15.650
<v Speaker 2>And my fear is that uncle amber sent a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous message in the sense that</v>

705
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.580
<v Speaker 2>people now believe everybody can come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

706
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.100
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the situation in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment,</v>

707
00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.413
<v Speaker 2>you see they're already struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the government is not </v>

708
00:40:27.571 --> 00:40:28.404
<v Speaker 2>willing to admit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the situation on the </v>

709
00:40:30.631 --> 00:40:32.340
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are really,</v>

710
00:40:32.341 --> 00:40:33.174
<v Speaker 2>really struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the opposition within even her own </v>

711
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.170
<v Speaker 2>party is growing by the day.</v>

712
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is an example where when I hear </v>

713
00:40:43.081 --> 00:40:44.070
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say,</v>

714
00:40:44.071 --> 00:40:44.904
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road to hell is paved with good </v>

715
00:40:45.871 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 1>intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Angela Merkel,</v>

716
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.560
<v Speaker 1>her intentions by bringing these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in where to help immigrants,</v>

717
00:40:52.561 --> 00:40:53.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help migrants,</v>

718
00:40:53.611 --> 00:40:56.790
<v Speaker 1>helped people that needed help integrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>them into society.</v>

719
00:40:56.791 --> 00:41:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Germany has a long history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia and and the Holocaust,</v>

720
00:41:01.441 --> 00:41:03.480
<v Speaker 1>so they were trying to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

721
00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

722
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:05.203
<v Speaker 1>I talked to people who think that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>maliciously is trying to destroy the </v>

723
00:41:07.351 --> 00:41:08.100
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

724
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:08.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't quite think it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was trying to do something </v>

725
00:41:10.831 --> 00:41:11.664
<v Speaker 1>good here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then because of I guess the </v>

726
00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:15.403
<v Speaker 1>questionable the vetting process or just</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing too many people and these </v>

727
00:41:17.821 --> 00:41:20.640
<v Speaker 1>people come in and then the system just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't take it.</v>

728
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And then when people in other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what's happening in Germany,</v>

729
00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:24.864
<v Speaker 1>they don't want it happening there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this whole thing is just has just </v>

730
00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:32.280
<v Speaker 1>snowballed and it is it too late?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have we already left this?</v>

731
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:33.114
<v Speaker 1>That the only will be that far right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parties are going to win throughout </v>

732
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:37.094
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

733
00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:38.771
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

734
00:41:38.771 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an eba master plan of,</v>

735
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:45.280
<v Speaker 2>of Angola to destroy Germany or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe Union.</v>

736
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.213
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe for whatever reason she </v>

737
00:41:49.151 --> 00:41:51.850
<v Speaker 2>believed that if the right thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is.</v>

738
00:41:51.851 --> 00:41:52.684
<v Speaker 2>I recently spoke to friends of mine who </v>
<v Speaker 2>sits in the German parliament for her </v>

739
00:41:56.321 --> 00:41:57.154
<v Speaker 2>party for the video and he said even now</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have still not having a discussion </v>

740
00:42:01.331 --> 00:42:03.580
<v Speaker 2>about quota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

741
00:42:03.581 --> 00:42:04.930
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no end to this,</v>

742
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.350
<v Speaker 2>that even the people within her own </v>
<v Speaker 2>party don't know where it stops.</v>

743
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:13.810
<v Speaker 2>And that of course gives people like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>far right in Germany and we see,</v>

744
00:42:13.811 --> 00:42:16.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the piggy to movement and we see the,</v>

745
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.210
<v Speaker 2>what is called the alternative for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

746
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.313
<v Speaker 2>These people are really gaining support </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really gaining ground and these are </v>

747
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:26.800
<v Speaker 2>of course not the people that we wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to handle the beat over to.</v>

748
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.560
<v Speaker 2>And I know that there are people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried remain to sti movements like piggy</v>

749
00:42:32.651 --> 00:42:33.550
<v Speaker 2>die and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

750
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:34.384
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are just concerned citizen to take </v>

751
00:42:36.191 --> 00:42:39.280
<v Speaker 2>to the streets and exercise their right </v>
<v Speaker 2>to free speech.</v>

752
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.320
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

753
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.153
<v Speaker 2>I'm quite familiar with DNRC seed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gemini and I looked at footage from </v>

754
00:42:45.131 --> 00:42:45.964
<v Speaker 2>Pegida demonstrations and do you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well known people from the Neo </v>

755
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Nazis taking part in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrations?</v>

756
00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.320
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not a fan of guilty by </v>
<v Speaker 2>association.</v>

757
00:42:56.321 --> 00:42:57.154
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot always control who comes to </v>

758
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.450
<v Speaker 2>your demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

759
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.110
<v Speaker 2>But it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy gave an interview to one</v>

760
00:43:02.111 --> 00:43:02.944
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Germany's a well known political </v>

761
00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:08.350
<v Speaker 2>magazines and very openly admitted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the NPD,</v>

762
00:43:08.351 --> 00:43:10.480
<v Speaker 2>which is the Neo Nazi party in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

763
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:15.630
<v Speaker 2>helped begin to organize this particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstration in the east of Germany.</v>

764
00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:19.324
<v Speaker 2>So you see already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the lines blurring between the </v>

765
00:43:23.411 --> 00:43:24.610
<v Speaker 2>populist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

766
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.790
<v Speaker 2>And really the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extreme extreme,</v>

767
00:43:27.791 --> 00:43:28.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

768
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious little,</v>

769
00:43:29.401 --> 00:43:33.380
<v Speaker 1>let's dig into Paquita a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had Tommy Robinson on the show</v>

770
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people were very angry at me.</v>

771
00:43:36.141 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of hate mail for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for even just talking to the guy now.</v>

772
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I think in the context of the hour of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our conversation,</v>

773
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:43.243
<v Speaker 1>he did basically make the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between ideas and people and all of </v>

774
00:43:46.851 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after the interview,</v>

775
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:49.604
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was pretty fruitful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people did send me tweets that he sent </v>

776
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:53.294
<v Speaker 1>out years before where he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about all Muslims and there clearly was </v>

777
00:43:57.021 --> 00:44:01.160
<v Speaker 1>an element of bigotry to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't vet my guests tweets from,</v>

778
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.650
<v Speaker 1>from five years ago unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

779
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.513
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of someone like him </v>

780
00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 1>that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I can tell,</v>

781
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.613
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to make the distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and I know he's left organizations </v>

782
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 1>when it's gone too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

783
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Or when they were bigoted against black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

784
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that just shows the complexity </v>

785
00:44:19.851 --> 00:44:21.260
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these organizations,</v>

786
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.820
<v Speaker 1>they have all kinds of people in them.</v>

787
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Tommy Robinson is a,</v>

788
00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:27.960
<v Speaker 2>is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

789
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:28.993
<v Speaker 2>tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to dive too much into this </v>

790
00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:32.124
<v Speaker 2>because to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not familiar with every everything </v>

791
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:36.180
<v Speaker 2>that he's doing at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

792
00:44:36.181 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I what I know is because I,</v>

793
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:39.263
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we worked with Quilliam as well and I </v>

794
00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:40.944
<v Speaker 2>know Martina was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was really trying to get him </v>

795
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:47.871
<v Speaker 2>away from the edl and at least making an</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt to engage with him and explained</v>

796
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 2>to him the difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

797
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:51.143
<v Speaker 2>the religion of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a set of leave and Islam as an </v>

798
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 2>ideology and Muslims as people and Islam</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

799
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 2>as a system of beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think to some extent,</v>

800
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're listening to what he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

801
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.020
<v Speaker 2>he has definitely made some progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

802
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

803
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

804
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:09.743
<v Speaker 2>sort of approve of everything that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says because I still believe that some </v>

805
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:16.200
<v Speaker 2>of the views that he holds a problematic</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say the least.</v>

806
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:17.260
<v Speaker 2>And for instances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>involvement,</v>

807
00:45:17.261 --> 00:45:18.094
<v Speaker 2>movement and the pig Edo movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is something that I do not approve </v>

808
00:45:20.101 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 2>off and I do not believe that piggy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't legitimate political.</v>

809
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

810
00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:25.323
<v Speaker 2>it legitimate in the sense that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have the right to speak their </v>

811
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:28.700
<v Speaker 2>minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

812
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:33.060
<v Speaker 2>but not legitimate in the sense that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would ever support their views.</v>

813
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.073
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I wanted to have him on </v>

814
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:36.444
<v Speaker 1>the show because I can't figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone thinks unless I talked to them </v>

815
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.920
<v Speaker 1>and maybe he secretly was harboring </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that he didn't allow me to hear.</v>

816
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.983
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we got a little closer to </v>

817
00:45:45.991 --> 00:45:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the truth maybe by talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>

818
00:45:47.671 --> 00:45:49.980
<v Speaker 1>you brought up my jacket and my jade is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

819
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 1>has been on the show and we've become </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>

820
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you think his job here is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest,</v>

821
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:56.783
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's much harder than what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing or what you are doing or what </v>

822
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:00.324
<v Speaker 1>Tommy's doing because he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reform the religion from the inside and </v>

823
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:05.454
<v Speaker 1>I see the most hate and the worst things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people on the left white people on </v>

824
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:15.591
<v Speaker 1>the left in America say about Majid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brown Muslim man from Egypt.</v>

825
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's getting the worst from everybody</v>

826
00:46:19.021 --> 00:46:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I think is his job the toughest?</v>

827
00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:22.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

828
00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:24.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't envy invite by any means.</v>

829
00:46:24.591 --> 00:46:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get a lot of hate mail and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

830
00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:30.860
<v Speaker 2>but that is nothing compared to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what he goes through.</v>

831
00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:34.190
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people say to him,</v>

832
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:35.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I would never get away with </v>

833
00:46:37.071 --> 00:46:37.670
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

834
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.580
<v Speaker 2>something similar to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Brown men.</v>

835
00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean we would rightly called a racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a bigot and a and in a summer job.</v>

836
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.340
<v Speaker 2>So I write hugely admire what he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do.</v>

837
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.510
<v Speaker 2>And obviously there are two types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I admire enormously.</v>

838
00:46:53.511 --> 00:46:54.261
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>

839
00:46:54.261 --> 00:46:55.094
<v Speaker 2>you have people that are in Hirsi Ali </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's left her faith and it's now </v>

840
00:46:57.921 --> 00:46:58.754
<v Speaker 2>campaigning really for people to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right to leave Islam and to </v>

841
00:47:02.331 --> 00:47:06.220
<v Speaker 2>criticize the religion and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like Margaret who's obviously had</v>

842
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:07.063
<v Speaker 2>a change of heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a Muslim and he wants to </v>

843
00:47:09.951 --> 00:47:13.580
<v Speaker 2>reform his faith from inside and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

844
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.453
<v Speaker 2>these are probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important people at the moment that we </v>

845
00:47:20.181 --> 00:47:21.014
<v Speaker 2>should support and align ourselves with </v>
<v Speaker 2>because let's be under no illusion </v>

846
00:47:24.771 --> 00:47:25.604
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

847
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.473
<v Speaker 2>We cannot win this fight without the </v>
<v Speaker 2>support and the friendship with people </v>

848
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 2>from inside the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need Muslim leaders.</v>

849
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:41.731
<v Speaker 2>We need Muslims themselves within within</v>
<v Speaker 2>their communities to speak up for a,</v>

850
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 2>for a form of Islam that is compatible </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the modern world.</v>

851
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.623
<v Speaker 2>And we see basically we see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see similar things happening in </v>

852
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Jordan and Egypt were President Sisi and</v>
<v Speaker 2>King Abdullah.</v>

853
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I now finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

854
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:54.604
<v Speaker 2>finding the words to address some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these problems and that is hugely </v>

855
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever else you may be.</v>

856
00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:00.844
<v Speaker 2>Think about what President Sisi is doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to journalists and to he human rights </v>

857
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:06.460
<v Speaker 2>activists and I certainly don't approve </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

858
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:11.670
<v Speaker 2>but I think he plays an important role </v>
<v Speaker 2>in fighting Islamic extremism.</v>

859
00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that again,</v>

860
00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.533
<v Speaker 1>that goes to the precarious position </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people that really care for human </v>

861
00:48:18.051 --> 00:48:23.051
<v Speaker 1>rights or put in so cc is doing terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things for human rights and minorities.</v>

862
00:48:23.451 --> 00:48:24.284
<v Speaker 1>And he's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's basically a military leader that </v>

863
00:48:26.031 --> 00:48:29.040
<v Speaker 1>took power by a coup after they had the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

864
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:33.590
<v Speaker 1>the actual democratic elections that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of ended up going the wrong way.</v>

865
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.713
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to play ball with him </v>

866
00:48:36.321 --> 00:48:39.050
<v Speaker 1>because at least Egypt is a stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

867
00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.153
<v Speaker 1>So if you care about human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have to play ball with </v>

868
00:48:43.641 --> 00:48:45.800
<v Speaker 1>these strong men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time the strong men</v>

869
00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.930
<v Speaker 1>do terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost sounds like a repeat of Saddam</v>

870
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:50.763
<v Speaker 1>Hussein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to say he's doing the types of </v>

871
00:48:51.621 --> 00:48:54.050
<v Speaker 1>violence to his own people that Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

872
00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.100
<v Speaker 1>But is that just the best wherever going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of this part of the world?</v>

873
00:48:59.410 --> 00:48:59.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

874
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:02.440
<v Speaker 2>it's always a mixture of optimism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>realism.</v>

875
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:03.363
<v Speaker 2>Mothers in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no pretty solution to </v>

876
00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:06.911
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

877
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:09.720
<v Speaker 2>even if you look at the curt who I </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatly support,</v>

878
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.390
<v Speaker 2>there were still problems within cardiac</v>
<v Speaker 2>societies that need to be addressed.</v>

879
00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.230
<v Speaker 2>So you do not find a perfect regime or </v>
<v Speaker 2>country in the middle.</v>

880
00:49:17.231 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 2>He is not even Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

881
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge supporter of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a self declared proud dryness.</v>

882
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved the state of Israel.</v>

883
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a beautiful country and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic country,</v>

884
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 2>but Israel is not perfect and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreed with this on certain things.</v>

885
00:49:31.811 --> 00:49:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously Egypt is a much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme example,</v>

886
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:37.840
<v Speaker 2>but I think people have the intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity.</v>

887
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:38.913
<v Speaker 2>So make a difference and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely disagree with this human </v>

888
00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:42.874
<v Speaker 2>rights record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do acknowledge that he is trying </v>

889
00:49:48.521 --> 00:49:50.250
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

890
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:54.810
<v Speaker 2>trigger a debate about Islam and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim world that we really,</v>

891
00:49:54.811 --> 00:49:55.644
<v Speaker 2>really need and what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only option that we didn't really </v>

892
00:49:58.361 --> 00:50:01.900
<v Speaker 2>have is to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cooperate with him on that,</v>

893
00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:02.763
<v Speaker 2>but we don't stop criticizing him when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he arrested journalists or human rights </v>

894
00:50:06.071 --> 00:50:07.510
<v Speaker 2>activist or anyone else.</v>

895
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

896
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:09.793
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of the West's </v>

897
00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 1>fascination or the left's fascination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>

898
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:14.980
<v Speaker 1>not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everyone's fascination.</v>

899
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's fascination with Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

900
00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:19.810
<v Speaker 1>this is a piece of land that's the size </v>
<v Speaker 1>of New Jersey.</v>

901
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 1>It has one international airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can drive east and west of it.</v>

902
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 1>The border to border in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

903
00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:30.350
<v Speaker 1>I think like four hours north and south </v>
<v Speaker 1>in like six or eight hours.</v>

904
00:50:30.351 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an absurdly tiny piece of land that</v>

905
00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:37.250
<v Speaker 1>gets all the media play a that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are obsessed with.</v>

906
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:37.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

907
00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I feel similarly to how you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>described it.</v>

908
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it's not perfect and </v>

909
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:44.654
<v Speaker 1>they're in a very precarious place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard when you have a tiny little </v>

910
00:50:46.881 --> 00:50:48.060
<v Speaker 1>border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

911
00:50:48.061 --> 00:50:50.360
<v Speaker 1>and the Middle East is a mess and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people die,</v>

912
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:51.343
<v Speaker 1>but what are you make it just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascination and the endless of the </v>

913
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:58.250
<v Speaker 1>United Nations endless assault on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one tiny little democracy there.</v>

914
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

915
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:02.223
<v Speaker 2>Bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know I'm going to get 100 hate </v>

916
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.433
<v Speaker 2>emails just holding Israel in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy and not an apart hype stated </v>

917
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.140
<v Speaker 2>engages in the genocide of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestinian people,</v>

918
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.063
<v Speaker 2>which by the way would be the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide ever to take place in history </v>

919
00:51:13.711 --> 00:51:16.030
<v Speaker 2>where the victim populations increases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

920
00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:16.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to begin,</v>

921
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.050
<v Speaker 1>can you just really lay that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

922
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:23.110
<v Speaker 1>the population of Gaza since 1967.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes something like four times</v>

923
00:51:23.111 --> 00:51:27.100
<v Speaker 1>bigger or even eight times bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think than it was back then.</v>

924
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.770
<v Speaker 1>So this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the reverse of the genocide.</v>

925
00:51:29.771 --> 00:51:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Not to say everything's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is certainly not a genotype</v>

926
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:34.560
<v Speaker 2>upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

927
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:38.720
<v Speaker 2>it's the only Jennifer in history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were the victim population.</v>

928
00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Having the alleged victim population has</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased,</v>

929
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.550
<v Speaker 2>that goes for both Gaza and the West </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bank,</v>

930
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.713
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at the standard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>living and something like health care </v>

931
00:51:51.261 --> 00:51:55.940
<v Speaker 2>and life expectancy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has all improved over the years.</v>

932
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that the Palestinians are</v>

933
00:51:58.191 --> 00:51:59.930
<v Speaker 2>not suffering and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:51:59.931 --> 00:52:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Israel is always right in the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it deals with the problem.</v>

935
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:03.884
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to say that Israel is engaging in a </v>

936
00:52:08.991 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 2>genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

937
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 2>the word genocide is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very serious allegation.</v>

938
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:18.371
<v Speaker 2>It is the crime of all crimes that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just absolutely bizarre and frankly,</v>

939
00:52:19.091 --> 00:52:19.770
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

940
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:24.770
<v Speaker 2>it relativizes the concept of genocide </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it relativizes to cry of people that</v>

941
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:27.314
<v Speaker 2>have actually committed a genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the most bizarre thing about it all </v>

942
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.053
<v Speaker 2>is that the people who accuse Israel of </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in genocide are often or very </v>

943
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:42.320
<v Speaker 2>often aligned with Hamas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just actually preaching a genocide,</v>

944
00:52:42.321 --> 00:52:44.660
<v Speaker 2>the genocide against the Jewish people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the irony,</v>

945
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:45.920
<v Speaker 2>the episode today about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All</v>

946
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.863
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I've tried to explain to </v>

947
00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:50.920
<v Speaker 1>people many times because people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that somehow on this issue,</v>

948
00:52:50.921 --> 00:52:51.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

949
00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.113
<v Speaker 1>this right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we maniac.</v>

950
00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm for two states where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have two actors that are willing to have</v>

951
00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:56.963
<v Speaker 1>two states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Hamas is only willing to have one </v>

952
00:52:59.381 --> 00:53:00.910
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

953
00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:01.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

954
00:53:01.691 --> 00:53:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Israel left Gaza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not one Jew in guys there,</v>

955
00:53:04.301 --> 00:53:05.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler would love the place.</v>

956
00:53:05.501 --> 00:53:08.200
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a store called Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a clothing store,</v>

957
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:11.020
<v Speaker 1>a in Gaza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

958
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:11.854
<v Speaker 1>what do you want them to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it seems that's one of the </v>

959
00:53:13.901 --> 00:53:18.670
<v Speaker 1>ones where religion is so tied to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in my opinion,</v>

960
00:53:18.671 --> 00:53:20.860
<v Speaker 1>they just simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't want Jews there.</v>

961
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right.</v>

962
00:53:23.431 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you not just listening what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamas is saying,</v>

963
00:53:26.071 --> 00:53:28.010
<v Speaker 2>but also to what president Abbas's </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

964
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the baby.</v>

965
00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.493
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tanya was saying the same things about </v>

966
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Arabs and Palestinians that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestinian Authority,</v>

967
00:53:36.561 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 2>you're saying about Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just Israeli Jews in general.</v>

968
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.293
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire word would probably go up in </v>

969
00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:47.820
<v Speaker 2>flames.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely ridiculous.</v>

970
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:48.654
<v Speaker 2>And what is also completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This visa interdependence theory that </v>

971
00:53:52.831 --> 00:53:57.831
<v Speaker 2>people some how believed that if only we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were to solve this problem and this tiny</v>

972
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.570
<v Speaker 2>strip of land at all the ills of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

973
00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:06.390
<v Speaker 2>of the Arab Muslim world would disappear</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to thin out.</v>

974
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:07.403
<v Speaker 2>I mean how is what we're seeing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory are related to the problem in </v>

975
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no relation,</v>

976
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:18.110
<v Speaker 2>there is no relation and this unhealthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsession with Israel is,</v>

977
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.733
<v Speaker 2>is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wrap my head around it because </v>

978
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:24.450
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that it's rent as perfect</v>

979
00:54:24.451 --> 00:54:25.284
<v Speaker 2>and I consider myself a critical friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Israel that reserves the right to </v>

980
00:54:28.621 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 2>criticize us were always read this </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

981
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I look around in the region and I</v>

982
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:34.284
<v Speaker 2>see what what's happening in Syria and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Saudis are doing to women in </v>

983
00:54:38.851 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 2>their own country,</v>

984
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:42.293
<v Speaker 2>why are we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we having a part hide weeks at </v>

985
00:54:45.001 --> 00:54:48.630
<v Speaker 2>our universities for Israel and never </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Saudi Arabia.</v>

986
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:49.643
<v Speaker 2>Why are we having mass demonstrations on</v>
<v Speaker 2>European street for the Palestinians in </v>

987
00:54:53.611 --> 00:54:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Gaza and the West Bank?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

988
00:54:55.261 --> 00:54:56.610
<v Speaker 2>if suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

989
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:57.833
<v Speaker 2>but that's nothing compared to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bashar Al Assad is doing to them in </v>

990
00:55:00.091 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starving them to death.</v>

991
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Actually really engaging in math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Palestinian.</v>

992
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:06.743
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't hear these people talking </v>

993
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:09.450
<v Speaker 2>about it because it's not really about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>

994
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:55:10.651 --> 00:55:11.720
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really.</v>

996
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not really about the Palestinians </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

997
00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 2>These people are really pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestinians.</v>

998
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.450
<v Speaker 2>What they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's anti Israel.</v>

999
00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the fascinating part.</v>

1000
00:55:20.241 --> 00:55:21.074
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the Yarmouk refugee camp in </v>

1001
00:55:22.581 --> 00:55:23.414
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means there should be no refugee </v>

1002
00:55:25.641 --> 00:55:27.710
<v Speaker 1>camps in any of these Arab countries for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestinians,</v>

1003
00:55:27.711 --> 00:55:30.200
<v Speaker 1>but they've kept Palestinians in refugee</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps.</v>

1004
00:55:30.201 --> 00:55:32.690
<v Speaker 1>They don't even let them become citizens</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside,</v>

1005
00:55:32.691 --> 00:55:35.270
<v Speaker 1>killed about 2000 of them within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last two years.</v>

1006
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody seems to care.</v>

1007
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.993
<v Speaker 1>So it was part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people just don't care about </v>

1008
00:55:39.501 --> 00:55:41.210
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1009
00:55:41.211 --> 00:55:41.871
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1010
00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:42.704
<v Speaker 1>go back to 1967,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as if there was peace </v>

1011
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.990
<v Speaker 1>before 1967.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

1012
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:48.883
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that the Westbank was </v>

1013
00:55:50.391 --> 00:55:53.360
<v Speaker 1>part of Jordan and that guy's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of Egypt.</v>

1014
00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:55.580
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as if the Palestinians had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to state then,</v>

1015
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:56.643
<v Speaker 1>so it's like people just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people love narrative over fact and </v>

1016
00:55:59.451 --> 00:56:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing this bleed into almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything these days.</v>

1017
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's old,</v>

1018
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.180
<v Speaker 2>so I mean they call it finer and finer </v>
<v Speaker 2>them today,</v>

1019
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:11.910
<v Speaker 2>what there are taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they really very often mean is,</v>

1020
00:56:11.911 --> 00:56:13.460
<v Speaker 2>is Judas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1021
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:18.490
<v Speaker 2>sign and it's just become a clean word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word to describe Jews.</v>

1022
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.400
<v Speaker 2>So it actually has a lot to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism,</v>

1023
00:56:22.401 --> 00:56:23.234
<v Speaker 2>which never went away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took different forms and different </v>

1024
00:56:26.351 --> 00:56:27.184
<v Speaker 2>ways of describing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really comes down in many cases </v>

1025
00:56:31.571 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 2>to the fact that people just don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>you staff.</v>

1026
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you realize people are going to say </v>

1027
00:56:35.821 --> 00:56:36.654
<v Speaker 1>you're a paid Mossad agent and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to paid Mossad agent and we're </v>

1028
00:56:39.991 --> 00:56:41.130
<v Speaker 1>working together on this.</v>

1029
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.553
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really angry now that you blew my </v>

1030
00:56:44.001 --> 00:56:47.930
<v Speaker 2>cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying so hard.</v>

1031
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:48.833
<v Speaker 1>You thought you were being slick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't pay me enough to really </v>

1032
00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:52.740
<v Speaker 1>keep it a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

1033
00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1034
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:55.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a call after the show,</v>

1035
00:56:55.521 --> 00:56:57.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have to explain myself.</v>

1036
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.433
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1037
00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:58.901
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1038
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:00.170
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we only have a few minutes left.</v>

1039
00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I want to circle back a little bit too </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the European problem.</v>

1040
00:57:04.291 --> 00:57:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I saw that this week in Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1041
00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:08.453
<v Speaker 1>that they're looking into stripping </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizenship of moms who are preaching </v>

1042
00:57:13.051 --> 00:57:16.260
<v Speaker 1>hate and preaching things against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state in Denmark.</v>

1043
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Now I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole ethos is about free speech.</v>

1044
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.103
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that I do here is about free </v>

1045
00:57:22.111 --> 00:57:22.944
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very torn on this one because I </v>

1046
00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:25.974
<v Speaker 1>would basically say that people can say </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that they want as long as </v>

1047
00:57:28.261 --> 00:57:30.210
<v Speaker 1>they're not inciting to violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1048
00:57:30.211 --> 00:57:31.044
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that these moms are </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going as close to the line on </v>

1049
00:57:34.321 --> 00:57:35.154
<v Speaker 1>that as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were preaching to take down the </v>

1050
00:57:37.051 --> 00:57:38.060
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1051
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:39.103
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least a inclination or hint that it </v>

1052
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:44.270
<v Speaker 1>may be through violent means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1053
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.450
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you fall on that?</v>

1054
00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Because I know you're huge on free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and secular values also.</v>

1055
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1056
00:57:50.541 --> 00:57:51.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1057
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm of course also have to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all we have to have.</v>

1058
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:56.974
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the lives of innocent people living </v>

1059
00:57:59.591 --> 00:58:00.424
<v Speaker 2>in our country and we just had a case in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK this week that the mom of the </v>

1060
00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:05.044
<v Speaker 2>largest mosque in in Scotland praised </v>
<v Speaker 2>the assassination of the anti blast for </v>

1061
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:14.140
<v Speaker 2>me activists in Pakistan a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1062
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:19.710
<v Speaker 2>And then just hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shopkeeper who posted a,</v>

1063
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:25.610
<v Speaker 2>a message on facebook congratulating </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians for Isa was brutally,</v>

1064
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:28.030
<v Speaker 2>brutally murdered,</v>

1065
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:30.330
<v Speaker 1>like a Muslim</v>

1066
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.900
<v Speaker 2>by a Muslim because he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he belongs to,</v>

1067
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.830
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Ahmadiyya Muslims,</v>

1068
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1069
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:42.160
<v Speaker 2>a largely peaceful and progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement within the Islamic community.</v>

1070
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:43.263
<v Speaker 2>And within the Muslim world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are often called heretics </v>

1071
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.273
<v Speaker 2>and a state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have to be surprised that </v>

1072
00:58:52.451 --> 00:58:53.284
<v Speaker 2>if the mom or the largest mosque in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scotland believes that it's perfectly </v>

1073
00:58:57.851 --> 00:59:01.570
<v Speaker 2>legitimate to murder people for last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1074
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.210
<v Speaker 2>what he actually meets with free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what these people call blast for me.</v>

1075
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:06.693
<v Speaker 2>That we then see people actually being </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered on our street in the name of </v>

1076
00:59:11.591 --> 00:59:13.720
<v Speaker 2>their religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know people would say no again,</v>

1077
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:14.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not a Muslim,</v>

1078
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:17.140
<v Speaker 2>but he was not in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with Islam,</v>

1079
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:18.183
<v Speaker 2>what it has something to do with Islam </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what these emom is preaching is </v>

1080
00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 2>based on Islamic teaching and there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>no way around it.</v>

1081
00:59:25.581 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can deny the problem and many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people still prefer to do that,</v>

1082
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:33.530
<v Speaker 2>but it is a part of Islam and we need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

1083
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:34.503
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I know you've made this </v>

1084
00:59:35.591 --> 00:59:38.110
<v Speaker 1>distinction several times even in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of this interview,</v>

1085
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.590
<v Speaker 1>but that there's a political component </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>

1086
00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:42.663
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just that the Islamists have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to blow up things and then maybe force </v>

1087
00:59:47.921 --> 00:59:51.070
<v Speaker 1>our governments to take away our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms to protect us,</v>

1088
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:52.203
<v Speaker 1>but that there's a political ideology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll use the rights that the </v>

1089
00:59:55.451 --> 01:00:00.451
<v Speaker 1>West grants them to preach these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn their own populace against us.</v>

1090
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.133
<v Speaker 1>When you start going down that route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all starts sounding like a big </v>

1091
01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:04.834
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy or something that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is this massive invasion and I </v>

1092
01:00:08.351 --> 01:00:09.184
<v Speaker 1>don't want to start using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fearmongering techniques that the right </v>

1093
01:00:11.951 --> 01:00:14.080
<v Speaker 1>uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that that's real,</v>

1094
01:00:14.081 --> 01:00:14.914
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a political element that </v>

1095
01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.430
<v Speaker 1>goes beyond violence here,</v>

1096
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm third years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Muslims don't need to,</v>

1097
01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:29.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infiltrated western countries.</v>

1098
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:30.543
<v Speaker 2>They just do this by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by immigrating to these countries and </v>

1099
01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:35.700
<v Speaker 2>then getting a lot of children because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1100
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.110
<v Speaker 2>That brings me back to what I said </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1101
01:00:38.111 --> 01:00:41.980
<v Speaker 2>We're not just fighting the jihadis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who commit violence.</v>

1102
01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:43.383
<v Speaker 2>We also have to deal with the Islamist </v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants to impose that way of life on </v>

1103
01:00:49.061 --> 01:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>our societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also with a conservative Muslims who</v>

1104
01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.470
<v Speaker 2>are maybe not Islam is and maybe not </v>
<v Speaker 2>jihadists,</v>

1105
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:57.723
<v Speaker 2>but who at least to a certain degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some of the things that these </v>

1106
01:01:00.011 --> 01:01:03.070
<v Speaker 2>people are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you look at opinion polls,</v>

1107
01:01:03.071 --> 01:01:03.904
<v Speaker 2>and I know this brings me dangerously </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to what happened to to Sam Harris </v>

1108
01:01:06.821 --> 01:01:10.900
<v Speaker 2>on that show with Ben Affleck looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion polls.</v>

1109
01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean legitimate opinion polls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not some fringe,</v>

1110
01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:17.680
<v Speaker 2>crazy conspiracy fearmongering opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>polls.</v>

1111
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.263
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what people in the Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 2>world think about apostates converting </v>

1112
01:01:25.121 --> 01:01:27.340
<v Speaker 2>from the religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving the religion,</v>

1113
01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.193
<v Speaker 2>it's shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is shocking the percentage of people </v>

1114
01:01:32.171 --> 01:01:37.171
<v Speaker 2>who believe it is legitimate to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence against people just leaving the</v>

1115
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:43.291
<v Speaker 2>religion or converting to another </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is to me absolutely shocking.</v>

1116
01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the West is fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something wrong here that somehow,</v>

1117
01:01:48.691 --> 01:01:49.524
<v Speaker 1>and I can even feel it when I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you knowing that we'd go out of our </v>

1118
01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>way to make this distinction over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

1119
01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>that we still feel we have to guard our </v>
<v Speaker 1>words somehow in all this and again,</v>

1120
01:01:57.661 --> 01:01:58.494
<v Speaker 1>as we've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of gives the strength to the </v>

1121
01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:00.743
<v Speaker 1>to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the west is doing something </v>

1122
01:02:02.311 --> 01:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>wrong in that we're not selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why freedom is good anymore.</v>

1123
01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.253
<v Speaker 1>There was a time where it was like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was cool to really stand up for Western </v>

1124
01:02:11.701 --> 01:02:12.534
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up for free speech and religious </v>

1125
01:02:13.861 --> 01:02:14.694
<v Speaker 1>plurality and rights of minorities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things and for all the </v>

1126
01:02:17.761 --> 01:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>faults of the West and for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for wars that we probably shouldn't have</v>

1127
01:02:21.601 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>got into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although they were,</v>

1128
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.173
<v Speaker 1>as I said at the top of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a thousand year old blood </v>

1129
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>flute feuds going on in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far boat before America was a country.</v>

1130
01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that nobody really stands up.</v>

1131
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>There aren't public figures anymore that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up and say,</v>

1132
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing here in the UK is still</v>

1133
01:02:39.961 --> 01:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still have more integration here than</v>

1134
01:02:42.811 --> 01:02:43.644
<v Speaker 1>they do in most other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly in the United States where </v>

1135
01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>people still want to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we're just,</v>

1136
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>we're just not doing a good sell job </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1137
01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I think you raised two interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>points here.</v>

1138
01:02:53.981 --> 01:02:55.420
<v Speaker 2>One is that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indeed.</v>

1139
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:56.343
<v Speaker 2>Every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if such an interview I think about </v>

1140
01:02:58.090 --> 01:02:58.923
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to say because I know it</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be people out there watching are </v>

1141
01:03:02.141 --> 01:03:04.720
<v Speaker 2>just waiting for me to slip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even intentionally,</v>

1142
01:03:04.721 --> 01:03:05.554
<v Speaker 2>just a snip and say something they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>twist and turn and make me sound like a </v>

1143
01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:10.714
<v Speaker 2>racist and a bigot and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people like John and Glenn </v>

1144
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Greenwald who do this on purpose and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have their own malicious agenda and they</v>

1145
01:03:20.051 --> 01:03:22.750
<v Speaker 2>know quite well they are misrepresenting</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're saying,</v>

1146
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.823
<v Speaker 2>but they're saying it anyway because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are too afraid to debate us with </v>

1147
01:03:25.931 --> 01:03:28.730
<v Speaker 2>ideas so all they can resort to is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1148
01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.620
<v Speaker 2>smearing us and trying to silence that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is one point.</v>

1149
01:03:32.621 --> 01:03:36.250
<v Speaker 2>And the second point that you raised </v>
<v Speaker 2>about not selling ourselves anymore.</v>

1150
01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.113
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you guys in America are doing more </v>

1151
01:03:40.121 --> 01:03:43.800
<v Speaker 2>of a better job at this than we do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe because you're still what?</v>

1152
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at it from a European</v>

1153
01:03:45.731 --> 01:03:48.700
<v Speaker 2>perspective now I left in Washington dc </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Harvey.</v>

1154
01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was really surprised how proud the</v>

1155
01:03:53.321 --> 01:03:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Americans really are about America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you come from from Europe,</v>

1156
01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:58.623
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still feel proud about America at </v>

1157
01:04:01.721 --> 01:04:02.554
<v Speaker 2>least compared to two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have to be part from this </v>

1158
01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.960
<v Speaker 2>perpetual sense of guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1159
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.823
<v Speaker 2>And and culture of self destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>self blaming that we have somewhat to </v>

1160
01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:19.450
<v Speaker 2>blame for all the ills of the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>East.</v>

1161
01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.770
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying the colonial period is</v>
<v Speaker 2>period was pretty,</v>

1162
01:04:23.771 --> 01:04:24.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't do terrible things to people </v>

1163
01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:28.443
<v Speaker 2>but this is not the reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow themselves up in Nigeria or </v>

1164
01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia.</v>

1165
01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.670
<v Speaker 2>This comes down to the Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms.audio</v>

1166
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:36.504
<v Speaker 2>that g and these people can ignite at as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as they like and they pretend it </v>

1167
01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.830
<v Speaker 2>all comes down to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1168
01:04:41.831 --> 01:04:46.300
<v Speaker 2>it's what George W dot Bush called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soft bigotry of low expectations because</v>

1169
01:04:46.301 --> 01:04:47.250
<v Speaker 2>somewhat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1170
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.093
<v Speaker 2>these brown people can not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for their own faded must </v>

1171
01:04:50.141 --> 01:04:54.040
<v Speaker 2>always come down to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must always have something to do with</v>

1172
01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:56.770
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can say that as long as they like,</v>

1173
01:04:56.771 --> 01:04:58.900
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't change the fact it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1174
01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.130
<v Speaker 2>And as you can explain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the global and I,</v>

1175
01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I believe magic now was called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>global Islamist insurgency.</v>

1176
01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:11.130
<v Speaker 2>You can only explain that and its roots </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the ideology of Islam,</v>

1177
01:05:11.881 --> 01:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Islam and not with Western foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

1178
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:15.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1179
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:16.374
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many of my guests have mentioned the </v>

1180
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soft bigotry of low expectations and</v>

1181
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:21.904
<v Speaker 1>many times on the show I kept quoting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was bill Maher that had </v>

1182
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>coined the phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I felt good about it.</v>

1183
01:05:27.011 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Then I learned it was a George W dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>

1184
01:05:29.261 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>It was one of his speech writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying it less,</v>

1185
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's the phrase that George </v>
<v Speaker 1>W dot Bush gave us that,</v>

1186
01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't have to be upset about.</v>

1187
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1188
01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite funny,</v>

1189
01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:43.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked about Iraq,</v>

1190
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:44.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1191
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.393
<v Speaker 2>they will actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who would have been happy at the </v>

1192
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 2>top of George w Bush and toppled Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hussein.</v>

1193
01:05:49.931 --> 01:05:50.764
<v Speaker 2>And that really brings us back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absurdity of the left and in everything </v>

1194
01:05:54.641 --> 01:05:55.474
<v Speaker 2>that we talked about today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all his faults and by no means </v>

1195
01:05:58.481 --> 01:06:02.590
<v Speaker 2>George W Bush was not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was also not a sudden the same.</v>

1196
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:03.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1197
01:06:03.511 --> 01:06:04.344
<v Speaker 1>so final thoughts to wrap all this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a crystal ball and you were </v>

1198
01:06:07.651 --> 01:06:12.651
<v Speaker 1>looking five or 10 years into the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>of where Europe is going to be a,</v>

1199
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.340
<v Speaker 1>the state of Jihad in Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam and all that,</v>

1200
01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.790
<v Speaker 1>or are you hopeful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel very hopeful right now.</v>

1201
01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:21.624
<v Speaker 1>The only grain that I can get this </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeful is that these conversations are </v>

1202
01:06:24.331 --> 01:06:29.220
<v Speaker 1>happening and at least that the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers aren't feeling as held hostage,</v>

1203
01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between jihadists and leftists.</v>

1204
01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's the hope for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how big,</v>

1205
01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:37.020
<v Speaker 1>how really hopeful I can</v>

1206
01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.453
<v Speaker 3>hang my hat on that.</v>

1207
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.970
<v Speaker 2>What I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am by nature an optimist.</v>

1208
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do the job if I were not an </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimist.</v>

1209
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.253
<v Speaker 2>And I do think there is reason for hope </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if I look at the emails that I </v>

1210
01:06:49.771 --> 01:06:51.700
<v Speaker 2>received,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tweet that I received,</v>

1211
01:06:51.701 --> 01:06:55.170
<v Speaker 2>the private messages that I received,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feedback that I received,</v>

1212
01:06:55.171 --> 01:06:56.004
<v Speaker 2>when I talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are waking up in our own </v>

1213
01:06:59.041 --> 01:06:59.970
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1214
01:06:59.971 --> 01:07:01.530
<v Speaker 2>I have many people come to me and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1215
01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually saying what I would like to</v>

1216
01:07:03.241 --> 01:07:04.740
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either they're,</v>

1217
01:07:04.741 --> 01:07:05.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're too afraid to say it because </v>

1218
01:07:06.421 --> 01:07:10.680
<v Speaker 2>they'll be called a racist or they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the rhetoric to really bring across</v>

1219
01:07:10.681 --> 01:07:13.860
<v Speaker 2>their views were just why shows like </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours are so important.</v>

1220
01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:15.773
<v Speaker 2>But also people in the Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Muslim women that we work </v>

1221
01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:22.440
<v Speaker 2>with really no longer want to live on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the oppression,</v>

1222
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.633
<v Speaker 2>who don't want to be treated as second </v>
<v Speaker 2>class citizens who have the right to </v>

1223
01:07:26.191 --> 01:07:28.320
<v Speaker 2>education and to opportunity in life.</v>

1224
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:30.750
<v Speaker 2>The free thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poets,</v>

1225
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.270
<v Speaker 2>the gentleness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the activist,</v>

1226
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.990
<v Speaker 2>minorities like homosexual converts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>

1227
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:42.180
<v Speaker 2>These are the most important people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim world at the moment.</v>

1228
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.710
<v Speaker 2>And who deserves all the respect and </v>
<v Speaker 2>support that we can give them.</v>

1229
01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:47.723
<v Speaker 2>And I think if we can forge a genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance between those in the Muslim </v>

1230
01:07:52.141 --> 01:07:52.974
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to see change and want to make </v>

1231
01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Islam compatible with the modern world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and us who are not afraid to speak.</v>

1232
01:08:00.601 --> 01:08:04.040
<v Speaker 2>How to probe about the problems of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and about the ideology.</v>

1233
01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:04.883
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the irony is that by denying all of </v>

1234
01:08:06.901 --> 01:08:07.734
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were actually aiding the extremists </v>

1235
01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:15.470
<v Speaker 2>because you're taking away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking away the justification for</v>

1236
01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:19.220
<v Speaker 2>those who want to bring about change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they want to bring about change.</v>

1237
01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 2>If you don't name the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take away the problem,</v>

1238
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 2>what are these people going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something we need to realize.</v>

1239
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the top of the show I said,</v>

1240
01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you've said that a religion is just a</v>

1241
01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>set of ideas and if there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political ideology or political party,</v>

1242
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 1>let's say that it was an offshoot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans here in the United States,</v>

1243
01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:37.934
<v Speaker 1>and it said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to throw gays off roofs and </v>

1244
01:08:39.171 --> 01:08:41.840
<v Speaker 1>we're going to put women in Burkas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to oppress minorities.</v>

1245
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Well then the progressive's would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>going bonkers and they'd be,</v>

1246
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>they'd be calling them the racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>

1247
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think you know,</v>

1248
01:08:49.431 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>where I'm going with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Julie,</v>

1249
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>it was really a pleasure talking to you</v>

1250
01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:55.590
<v Speaker 2>and was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my pleasure.</v>

1251
01:08:55.591 --> 01:08:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much for having me on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1252
01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

1253
01:08:58.131 --> 01:09:00.950
<v Speaker 1>And you guys can find out more about </v>
