<v Speaker 1>Joining me today as a contributor for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada's national post known here on the</v>

2
00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as my name is Josephine,</v>

3
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Josephine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matthias,</v>

4
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Rubin Room.</v>

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited to be here.</v>

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 2>So your real name is Josefina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My name is Jason.</v>

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

8
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like an alias isn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>not that believable.</v>

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Josephine and people are </v>

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 1>always getting pumped on line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were curious.</v>

11
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was gonna say.</v>

12
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:38.551
<v Speaker 2>I think they assume it's like bunky show</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something to Joseph until really </v>

13
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:38.551
<v Speaker 2>late.</v>

14
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

15
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:44.141
<v Speaker 1>well I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really super psyched that you're </v>

16
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:45.791
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We met about a month and a half ago in </v>

17
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:47.831
<v Speaker 1>Toronto after Jordan Peterson thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to chat a little bit and I've </v>

18
00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:51.521
<v Speaker 1>been a fan of what you're doing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile and I think you're actually one </v>

19
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>of the few people on the youtube making </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

20
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel fresh.</v>

21
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

22
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do a little bit about your </v>

23
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.051
<v Speaker 1>history first and then we're gonna play </v>
<v Speaker 1>a clip from one of your videos in case </v>

24
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>people haven't seen some of your stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to talk about all </v>

25
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>sorts of political stuff because you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>a true political beast.</v>

26
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>So you're originally from Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived there for what,</v>

27
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>eight or nine years before he moved to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

28
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So tell me about growing up in Nigeria.</v>

29
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

30
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't remember much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up in Nigeria and my parents </v>

31
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 2>kind of a closed me off to what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really going on.</v>

32
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I lived in a gated community and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

33
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I immigrated here when I was nine years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

34
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 2>My Dad actually first went to Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was two.</v>

35
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got here on a work visa,</v>

36
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.210
<v Speaker 2>worked his ass off for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for about seven years actually.</v>

37
00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know who my dad was for </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years.</v>

38
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:41.710
<v Speaker 2>And then when he got his visa and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

39
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 2>he brought my family over and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm in.</v>

40
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a great country.</v>

41
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did your dad do?</v>

42
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Was able to get a visa to go there.</v>

43
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was an accountant and then when </v>

44
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 2>he got to Canada he went back to school </v>
<v Speaker 2>and decided to do nursing inside.</v>

45
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 2>And my mom's a teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

46
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does your mom teach?</v>

47
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she teaches.</v>

48
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 2>She taught English in Nigeria and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>she kind of teaches special ed kids and </v>

49
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she still loves teaching.</v>

50
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 2>She obviously can't teach a Nigerian </v>
<v Speaker 2>person can teach English in Canada,</v>

51
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she still loves teaching,</v>

52
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 2>so I'm glad she's still kind of gets to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

53
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my dad's accountant,</v>

54
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.270
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom's a teacher.</v>

55
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do your parents tell you anything about </v>

56
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>the political situation or anything at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time when you were growing up?</v>

57
00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't have great memories of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

58
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily.</v>

59
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 2>My parents were not really that </v>
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>

60
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I think we became more political when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to Canada and I mean politics in </v>

61
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely corrupt.</v>

62
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all just money.</v>

63
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:41.671
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was when I came to Canada is when </v>

64
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 2>they start to get a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>political and uh,</v>

65
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think religion and strict parents </v>

66
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 2>kinda create conservatism in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're very,</v>

67
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:49.000
<v Speaker 2>very conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

68
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 2>so I grew up about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

69
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>around that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't really name it as </v>

70
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just strict and religious and had</v>

71
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Speaker 2>all these rules that basically apply to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism in the way.</v>

72
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you get to Canada,</v>

73
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:05.461
<v Speaker 2>you're not even 10 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that like to be in a new </v>

74
00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:06.420
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weird here.</v>

75
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 16 degrees outside and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was freezing.</v>

76
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>So why is it so cold?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was people wearing tee shirts.</v>

77
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I did not understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

78
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>I remember like driving from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport,</v>

79
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>I think it's piercing airport and we all</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped and was like,</v>

80
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 2>why are we stopping?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

81
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a red light.</v>

82
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you just go with us?</v>

83
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's like,</v>

84
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 2>there's order here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

85
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

86
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 2>And snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snow is the best one.</v>

87
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I think I spent like half an hour just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like touching it and like,</v>

88
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:36.571
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my elementary school teachers or </v>

89
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:36.571
<v Speaker 2>middle school teachers had to tell me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back inside.</v>

90
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

91
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was surreal.</v>

92
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 2>It was a culture shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was mostly a weather related,</v>

93
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 2>whether an order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether an order.</v>

94
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically it,</v>

95
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 2>whether in order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say you grew up in like a in</v>

96
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 2>a religious atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that like?</v>

97
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.910
<v Speaker 2>My parents were just super religious and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hoped I'd be also as religious as </v>

98
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately I'm not.</v>

99
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 2>But I think that kinda comes with age </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also living in a different country.</v>

100
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easier,</v>

101
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority of people are religious.</v>

102
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

103
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are still a very,</v>

104
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:11.550
<v Speaker 2>very good Catholic Protestants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.740
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

106
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

107
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 2>So now you're in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a kid,</v>

108
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 2>you're making a good life for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did you get interested in politics?</v>

109
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got interested in politics a while I'm</v>

110
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>taking political science and studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>political science in school right now.</v>

111
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was also president of the debate club,</v>

112
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I was just interested in like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>scores and discussing things.</v>

113
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I was interested in people's ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ideas and reasoning,</v>

114
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:37.220
<v Speaker 2>the reason for things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

115
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.540
<v Speaker 2>but I also think my political views were</v>
<v Speaker 2>really shaped by me immigrating to </v>

116
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Canada and we lived in the inner cities.</v>

117
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if you've ever heard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jane and finch by any chance.</v>

118
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like a south side of Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>

119
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 2>like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously not as bad,</v>

120
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's an inner city majority black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

121
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor neighborhoods.</v>

122
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I lived there for most of my Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 2>life actually.</v>

123
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 2>And then from there I moved to a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher income neighborhood and having to</v>

124
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:07.171
<v Speaker 2>experience that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was really cool kind of seeing </v>

125
00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 2>like the culture there and then get </v>
<v Speaker 2>another culture shock and move somewhere</v>

126
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like I've experienced,</v>

127
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria in the inner city in Canada and </v>

128
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 2>then a much more well off neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

129
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 2>which would you say is the best out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those three?</v>

130
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria know all of neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

131
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:26.791
<v Speaker 2>living in the inner cities really shaped</v>
<v Speaker 2>my views because now when I look back I </v>

132
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

133
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

134
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 2>You are a product of your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people that,</v>

135
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:36.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about two slash three of my </v>

136
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:39.721
<v Speaker 2>friends made it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority of them are pregnant or </v>

137
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:43.260
<v Speaker 2>single parents now they're in the system</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's unfortunate and weird to see </v>

138
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.671
<v Speaker 2>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my parents being extremely strict </v>

139
00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>and they gave me a curfew at like 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM everyday.</v>

140
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't allowed to have boyfriends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I guess I was young,</v>

141
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I probably shouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were really,</v>

142
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 2>really strict and I hated them at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

143
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand why they didn't me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go out and play</v>

144
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>with people and now I get it because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have ended up like a lot of the </v>

145
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>people that are still there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then yeah,</v>

146
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:09.101
<v Speaker 1>moving to the much better neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that while there is a </v>

147
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a cultural difference I guess.</v>

148
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>But so when I've watched a ton of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

149
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

150
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I sensed that she basically is a liberal</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of liberal,</v>

151
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>but I think you have probably some </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative leanings perhaps,</v>

152
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:28.571
<v Speaker 1>or at least have an understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what you're laying out </v>

153
00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:30.941
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an understanding of that line </v>

154
00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:30.941
<v Speaker 1>of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>You consider yourself a classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>

156
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to push you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to hear you say it but,</v>

157
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>but what do you actually consider your </v>
<v Speaker 1>views to be okay here?</v>

158
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I know everyone says they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting labels,</v>

159
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>but I absolutely hate labels because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have some conservative ideas.</v>

160
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I have some liberal ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some classical liberal ideas.</v>

161
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some progressive ideas,</v>

162
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>socialist ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

163
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>but I guess I just see a look of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>from issue to issue,</v>

164
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:57.720
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

165
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily liberal,</v>

166
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>but I'm fiscally conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of where I lean I guess.</v>

167
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>So the route I think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your ideas,</v>

168
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of individualization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

169
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.640
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>You want to throw to a clip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

171
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.020
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

172
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's get people to know you in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural environment.</v>

173
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.160
<v Speaker 2>West has also been tweeting about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of freedom of thought in America </v>

174
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 2>and the backlash about whether blacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be allowed to be Republicans.</v>

175
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Sure is helping prove his point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but black Americans,</v>

176
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:27.701
<v Speaker 2>contrary to popular belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can hold wildly diverse and opposing </v>

177
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 2>opinions and political issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Connie was a republican.</v>

178
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's ever referred to himself as </v>
<v Speaker 2>such,</v>

179
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:36.071
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said something about trump that </v>

180
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 2>wasn't severely negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he suddenly the Black Paul Ryan,</v>

181
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 2>but even if he is so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

182
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:45.131
<v Speaker 2>a 2012 study by Vincent Hutchins and </v>
<v Speaker 2>King Jefferson using data from the </v>

183
00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:49.331
<v Speaker 2>American national election studies found</v>
<v Speaker 2>that 45 percent of black Americans </v>

184
00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 2>identify as conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite this,</v>

185
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:55.541
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic Party typically receives </v>

186
00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 2>85 to 95 percent of the black American </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>

187
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 2>The tendency of black Americans to vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat allows the to believe that they</v>

188
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 2>have a strong hold on the black American</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>

189
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.540
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in 2016 when Connie was announced </v>

190
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:07.540
<v Speaker 2>he would run for president in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

191
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic Party's official twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>account immediately assumed.</v>

192
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 2>He meant you'd be running for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>responding.</v>

193
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr West.</v>

194
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Glad to have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If only the Dems had Ron Kanye in 2016,</v>

195
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.530
<v Speaker 2>better candidate than she who shall not </v>
<v Speaker 2>be named.</v>

196
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.350
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

197
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I picked that one because I think this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a great example of what you do.</v>

198
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:30.151
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's information and facts and it's </v>

199
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:30.430
<v Speaker 1>kind of light to and fun and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>good stuff.</v>

200
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first off though,</v>

201
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.630
<v Speaker 1>as a black Canadian yapping about black </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>

202
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:36.640
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you say?</v>

203
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've gotten a lot of comments </v>

204
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.801
<v Speaker 1>when people say like he don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be black in America </v>

205
00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:43.801
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

206
00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:48.221
<v Speaker 1>I thought I can have those same </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions about race relations in </v>

207
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:48.730
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little scaled down in,</v>

208
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:53.731
<v Speaker 1>in the Canadian context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of Canadians try to </v>

209
00:08:53.731 --> 00:08:56.551
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I American issues on Canadians </v>

210
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:56.551
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

211
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:56.551
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

212
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:56.551
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

213
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I do get that criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is annoying.</v>

214
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 2>We should all be allowed to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we want.</v>

215
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 2>You are a black in America right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

216
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's awful.</v>

217
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean by 10 times people are yelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>the n word at me.</v>

218
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel so unsafe.</v>

219
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why we create a safe space </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

220
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

221
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I won't hook that video though </v>

222
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.381
<v Speaker 2>because the numbers that you laid out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are actually kind of incredible </v>

223
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:25.551
<v Speaker 2>and something that we obviously have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been talking about lately related to </v>

224
00:09:25.551 --> 00:09:28.761
<v Speaker 2>Kanye and candice and the rest of it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 percent of black Americans consider </v>

225
00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:34.321
<v Speaker 2>themselves conservative yet at 85 to 95 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent are voting democrat.</v>

226
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.690
<v Speaker 2>That is a massive disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

227
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>So what do you make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

228
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.260
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party is the best one for </v>

229
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:44.260
<v Speaker 2>black Americans.</v>

230
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 2>It's the one that's going to help black </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

231
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 2>And although they are conservative in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the true sense of the word,</v>

232
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.960
<v Speaker 2>they aren't necessarily Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe in the Republican </v>

233
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

234
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very interesting,</v>

235
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean no one group or identity bolts </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way as black Americans do.</v>

236
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 2>So there is some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

237
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 2>story that's being told to them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the way to do it.</v>

238
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 2>This is the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think,</v>

239
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:10.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Republican party per se is the way </v>

240
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:10.011
<v Speaker 2>to go and I don't think the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Party,</v>

241
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:10.510
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think both parties are just garbage at</v>

242
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

243
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.940
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a little odd that the </v>

244
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 2>majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>95 percent vote one single way,</v>

245
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 2>but yet there are still conservative in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense.</v>

246
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

247
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:22.960
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

248
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:28.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a leftover ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they just need to kind of start to </v>

249
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 2>refigure things out.</v>

250
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 2>But first we probably have to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

251
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing up the government and changing </v>

252
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.941
<v Speaker 2>up the party systems and try to find who</v>
<v Speaker 2>to vote for instead of just picking </v>

253
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:41.271
<v Speaker 2>Democrat or a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think this was more of a good </v>

254
00:10:41.271 --> 00:10:44.181
<v Speaker 2>sell job by the Democrats are a bad cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>job by the Republicans because when you </v>

255
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 2>look at all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cities,</v>

256
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:47.880
<v Speaker 2>especially where it's the worst for </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>

257
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 2>they're always democrat run cities for </v>
<v Speaker 2>decade after decade after decade.</v>

258
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Yet black people still extremely high </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers keep voting Democrat.</v>

259
00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:02.181
<v Speaker 2>So that's obviously a great sell job if </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's doing some serious pr </v>

260
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:02.181
<v Speaker 2>workload.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

261
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:02.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

262
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:06.951
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also the Republicans as </v>

263
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:09.351
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Black Democrats make it feel </v>

264
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:13.791
<v Speaker 2>like the Republicans are against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>black Americans and the Democrats and </v>

265
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:13.900
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans make it feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.410
<v Speaker 2>the black Americans are against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>

267
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think both sides are not necessarily </v>

268
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.911
<v Speaker 2>trying to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to pander to their </v>

269
00:11:22.911 --> 00:11:24.951
<v Speaker 2>own side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is interesting that you've been </v>

270
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:24.951
<v Speaker 2>voting Democrat for so long and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not getting better.</v>

271
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

272
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:27.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should start voting a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

273
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:29.850
<v Speaker 2>or maybe I should start criticizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party.</v>

274
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that's actually the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is it's not picking a side.</v>

275
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 2>It's criticizing what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

276
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:36.010
<v Speaker 2>It's criticizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 2>this didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's try something else.</v>

278
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Instead of just saying we need Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

279
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 2>This is what's gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's clearly not not working.</v>

280
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:48.141
<v Speaker 2>Let's try to figure out what policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes we need instead of trying to </v>

281
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:48.141
<v Speaker 2>pick like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Democrat or Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

283
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I keep saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten.</v>

284
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

285
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know you're not.</v>

286
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 2>You're not a huge proponent</v>

287
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 1>of the SORTA candice Kanye training in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

288
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that that conversation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening now,</v>

289
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you made that video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you view that all as positive,</v>

290
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

291
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

292
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:10.321
<v Speaker 2>I think Connie really allowed a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to think for a second and try to </v>

293
00:12:10.321 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 2>investigate some more information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to figure out what their real.</v>

294
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Why do they hold certain ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the biggest thing and </v>

295
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.301
<v Speaker 2>it was really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like scroll through facebook and </v>

296
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:21.301
<v Speaker 2>see people that are not normally </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in politics now.</v>

297
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might be scary because it's like </v>

298
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people are saying don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what they're doing,</v>

299
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:32.221
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have them involved in some </v>

300
00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:32.221
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

301
00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:32.221
<v Speaker 2>I would rather have them involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

302
00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I think as much as I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

303
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dislike is politics.</v>

304
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:40.711
<v Speaker 2>I do think that it opened a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's minds in the sense that it </v>

305
00:12:40.711 --> 00:12:44.011
<v Speaker 2>allowed them to investigate more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most important thing because </v>

306
00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:44.011
<v Speaker 2>then you're just stuck in the echo </v>
<v Speaker 2>chamber.</v>

307
00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Connie broke that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

308
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.700
<v Speaker 2>all they see is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

309
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Speaker 2>beyonce and Chrissy Tiegen and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities that are all just talking </v>

310
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:51.770
<v Speaker 2>about the far left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

311
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.820
<v Speaker 2>super.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate saying social justice for ever </v>

312
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:56.820
<v Speaker 2>super social justice warrior talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

313
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.350
<v Speaker 2>So kanye broke that and showed them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>

314
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately I think,</v>

315
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 2>because candace is kind of harsh and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

317
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it's harder for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>connect with her that are already sold </v>

318
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.221
<v Speaker 2>down the drain of the far left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately we might have to </v>

319
00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:14.221
<v Speaker 2>cuddle them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill it,</v>

320
00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:15.520
<v Speaker 2>we'll come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to the other side.</v>

321
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me explain things to you.</v>

322
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.870
<v Speaker 1>So do you view that as just like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality trait because that's what's </v>

323
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.681
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people used to say to me all the </v>

324
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:26.681
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

325
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if when you have milo on like Milo's </v>

326
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 1>creating chaos and out of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully my feeling was if I brought my</v>

327
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:34.400
<v Speaker 1>low on that out of the chaos that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>creates,</v>

328
00:13:34.401 --> 00:13:37.490
<v Speaker 1>that some people would hear some good </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas in a more calm,</v>

329
00:13:37.491 --> 00:13:41.520
<v Speaker 1>relaxed way and then they joined me on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the adventure that I'm on it.</v>

330
00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I think there's proof in that pudding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're kind of a little bit more</v>

331
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:49.991
<v Speaker 1>like where I think you see the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of the chaos that candice is </v>

332
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:50.840
<v Speaker 1>creating and you want people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the ideas behind them.</v>

333
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

334
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.150
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

335
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.530
<v Speaker 2>when candice says one thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

336
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.190
<v Speaker 2>stop the victim mentality for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

337
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I think a black Americans that are stuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like the far left echo chamber just </v>

338
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.410
<v Speaker 2>sees it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

339
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.560
<v Speaker 2>like what are you trying to save a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little blah?</v>

340
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's like they need either she </v>
<v Speaker 2>explains it further,</v>

341
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.050
<v Speaker 2>which obviously she doesn't have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>

342
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.940
<v Speaker 2>she can do whatever she wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think she needs to break it down a</v>

343
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:13.920
<v Speaker 2>little more because saying get off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plantation,</v>

344
00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:18.921
<v Speaker 2>the victim hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's harder for people that all they've </v>

345
00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:19.020
<v Speaker 2>ever heard is white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people suck,</v>

346
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:24.021
<v Speaker 2>blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's harder for them to kind of </v>

347
00:14:24.021 --> 00:14:24.021
<v Speaker 2>understand where she's coming from </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you do break it down it makes</v>

348
00:14:24.021 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 2>a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's just rolling like that,</v>

349
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.170
<v Speaker 2>then it's harder for them to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

350
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.200
<v Speaker 2>What they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The I keep pointing here like the </v>

351
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 2>liberals are these people over here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

352
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.410
<v Speaker 2>So it just seemed to kind of break it </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and figure</v>

353
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.030
<v Speaker 1>you think maybe you need both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in any movement,</v>

354
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:44.031
<v Speaker 1>like if you just look at the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights movement that Malcolm x was </v>

355
00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:48.410
<v Speaker 1>different than Martin Luther King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even the way comedians talk about </v>

356
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.711
<v Speaker 1>things differently cause we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>things differently than Dick Gregory </v>

357
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 1>than Chappelle and Chris Rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just need people.</v>

358
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:54.130
<v Speaker 1>People just get affected by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different.</v>

359
00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shock value works,</v>

360
00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean it gets people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wakes people up,</v>

361
00:14:57.511 --> 00:15:00.480
<v Speaker 2>it allows them to kind of be more aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what's going on.</v>

362
00:15:00.481 --> 00:15:02.430
<v Speaker 2>I totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think we need both of them.</v>

363
00:15:02.431 --> 00:15:03.720
<v Speaker 2>We need people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

364
00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:04.950
<v Speaker 2>shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being annoying.</v>

365
00:15:04.951 --> 00:15:07.470
<v Speaker 2>And we also need people to say here's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why you're being annoying.</v>

366
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I think we most certainly need both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

367
00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I think she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what she does is she's awesome.</v>

368
00:15:12.751 --> 00:15:16.020
<v Speaker 2>She has such a great platform and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are also other people that are doing the</v>

369
00:15:16.021 --> 00:15:21.021
<v Speaker 2>same thing but in a more kind of calmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying she's like crazy or </v>

370
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:21.690
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

371
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just,</v>

372
00:15:22.711 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 2>she's a tough girl and it's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sjws aren't snowflakes.</v>

373
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.650
<v Speaker 2>So I really had any interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily,</v>

374
00:15:31.651 --> 00:15:36.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think we've done under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we've talked over dms on twitter </v>

375
00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:36.670
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

376
00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:41.671
<v Speaker 2>and this was after the whole Blair white</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate and that was white guys guys,</v>

377
00:15:42.511 --> 00:15:43.200
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

378
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

379
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just at reaching out to her and </v>

380
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 2>asking her like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

381
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't because she was,</v>

382
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:54.231
<v Speaker 2>I think closing everyone off that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing her and I didn't want to </v>

383
00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:55.140
<v Speaker 2>openly criticize her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go directly to the source,</v>

384
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.140
<v Speaker 2>but we left off on a good note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

385
00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll put it out here.</v>

386
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we have a Jay z Kanye moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you both can come on the show </v>

387
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.350
<v Speaker 1>sometime and talk it out and going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like guys,</v>

388
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.820
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

389
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a glutton for punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was doing a little research </v>

390
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.110
<v Speaker 1>and I knew one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was most interesting is that.</v>

391
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:16.360
<v Speaker 1>So you have a twin sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

392
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.850
<v Speaker 1>And part of your awakening was related </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a paper that she was writing in </v>

393
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

394
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.440
<v Speaker 1>So can you tell me about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's pretty fascinating.</v>

395
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

396
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my sister is not into politics at </v>

397
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.361
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is studying marketing and she </v>

398
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:32.361
<v Speaker 2>decided to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was to Ryerson University,</v>

399
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:35.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest far left universities</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Canada.</v>

400
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took a sociology course that was her </v>

401
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.930
<v Speaker 2>fault and it was called how society </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

402
00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:47.931
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the title of the course </v>
<v Speaker 2>or is what bothered me because if the </v>

403
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:49.260
<v Speaker 2>chorus was feminism studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the course was,</v>

404
00:16:49.261 --> 00:16:51.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how women are oppressed and yeah,</v>

405
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:56.110
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is how society works and you </v>

406
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.991
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your assignment they had to talk </v>

407
00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:00.321
<v Speaker 2>about some societal issue and discuss it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and analyze it or whatever and she </v>

408
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:03.060
<v Speaker 2>wanted to talk about the weight or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually encouraged her.</v>

409
00:17:03.061 --> 00:17:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I like you to talk about the wage gap </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

410
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.010
<v Speaker 2>how it's falls and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it's misinterpreted and all of that.</v>

411
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.530
<v Speaker 2>And you were sending her up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was setting her up a little.</v>

412
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to test it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know it was there.</v>

413
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.550
<v Speaker 2>A professor would respond that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

414
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.280
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told her to write about the wage gap.</v>

415
00:17:17.281 --> 00:17:19.440
<v Speaker 2>So she just sounds like a short thesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and said like,</v>

416
00:17:19.441 --> 00:17:21.810
<v Speaker 2>here's what I want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to use studies,</v>

417
00:17:21.811 --> 00:17:22.030
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

418
00:17:22.031 --> 00:17:22.860
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me know.</v>

419
00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 2>And the professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

420
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.460
<v Speaker 2>her response is a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

421
00:17:26.461 --> 00:17:31.461
<v Speaker 2>I hope I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys can like put it up or </v>

422
00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:33.291
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the reality is patriarchy do </v>

423
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.070
<v Speaker 2>not use business sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They blame women and it's like period.</v>

424
00:17:35.071 --> 00:17:37.890
<v Speaker 2>The reality is patriarchy can do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>blame women and like,</v>

425
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:38.050
<v Speaker 2>you know</v>

426
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.320
<v Speaker 1>the screenshot on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say yes for sure.</v>

427
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

428
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I was reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

429
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fake,</v>

430
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:44.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

431
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.610
<v Speaker 2>And this is definitely fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

432
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:49.190
<v Speaker 2>she basically shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said your premise is completely.</v>

433
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:54.650
<v Speaker 2>And it was one of the most absurd emails</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever and use only feminist sources.</v>

434
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.920
<v Speaker 2>And in the assignment details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the list of sources they can't use was </v>

435
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:03.270
<v Speaker 2>dictionary.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The encyclopedia.</v>

436
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't use the government of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada website,</v>

437
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't use statistic Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Statistics Canada.</v>

438
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how does that even make sense?</v>

439
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to explain how society</v>
<v Speaker 2>works?</v>

440
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 2>And the only source you have is feminist</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies,</v>

441
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 2>as Peterson has mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many times they're not cited.</v>

442
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just within this little group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

443
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.520
<v Speaker 2>these aren't real textbooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

444
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

445
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it blew my mind and I was so excited and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she sat back because I was like,</v>

446
00:18:28.561 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what is wrong.</v>

447
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:30.810
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

448
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>so your sister gets this response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was her response?</v>

449
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Was she like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

450
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.060
<v Speaker 2>look what you did to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

451
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:40.100
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was upset at me and she thought I </v>

452
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:40.100
<v Speaker 2>was wrong and I have to sit her down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

453
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me explain it to you.</v>

454
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Here is what is actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the end of that conversation,</v>

455
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

456
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every class I go to,</v>

457
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I've been lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are lying to me every single day,</v>

458
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:49.670
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

459
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

460
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 2>it's so messed up and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't teaching.</v>

461
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>This is imposing your political ideas on</v>
<v Speaker 2>students because if it's teaching,</v>

462
00:18:57.031 --> 00:19:02.031
<v Speaker 2>you teach it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you show them the facts and let your </v>

463
00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:02.031
<v Speaker 2>students come up with their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions.</v>

464
00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:06.620
<v Speaker 2>This is not teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to tell them how to think </v>

465
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:06.620
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

466
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.830
<v Speaker 2>I did some research on her actually and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's the highest paid woman in her </v>

467
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.610
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in her department.</v>

468
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:16.350
<v Speaker 2>She makes more money than the male </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterparts are you talking about?</v>

469
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.920
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure there's a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

470
00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:24.921
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like there's obviously reasons </v>

471
00:19:24.921 --> 00:19:24.921
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably works more hours,</v>

472
00:19:24.921 --> 00:19:24.921
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

473
00:19:24.921 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 2>doing all these other things and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you can explain the wage gap.</v>

474
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.330
<v Speaker 2>So it was just interesting to me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>why like why are you doing this?</v>

475
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Why are you lying to your students or </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't the point of education for you?</v>

476
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or essays or assignments like you're </v>

477
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.070
<v Speaker 2>supposed to come to your own conclusions</v>
<v Speaker 2>by using facts.</v>

478
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.620
<v Speaker 2>We have the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with it?</v>

479
00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:42.650
<v Speaker 2>She just didn't want those facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

480
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 2>it blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was the right.</v>

481
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're often not for facts.</v>

482
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facts that they allege facts.</v>

483
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.850
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened with the paper?</v>

484
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.650
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

485
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:57.651
<v Speaker 2>this is too much for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sister and she ended up just doing </v>

486
00:19:57.651 --> 00:20:00.291
<v Speaker 2>some other topic and try to pander to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the professor wanted to get a good </v>

487
00:20:00.291 --> 00:20:00.291
<v Speaker 2>mark.</v>

488
00:20:00.291 --> 00:20:01.890
<v Speaker 2>And that is my advice to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>students is like,</v>

489
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:04.410
<v Speaker 2>just suck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you are already in this class,</v>

490
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:06.900
<v Speaker 2>it's not worth getting a bad mark over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

491
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.280
<v Speaker 2>however.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

492
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 2>The great thing about it was I got a ton</v>
<v Speaker 2>of messages from students from her class</v>

493
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.240
<v Speaker 2>started to explain all the other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this teacher is engaging and how </v>

494
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:17.790
<v Speaker 2>awful it is and not made me happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they said,</v>

495
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next week I'm going to speak up and I'm </v>

496
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>going to tell her she's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

497
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:22.880
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

498
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.130
<v Speaker 2>but be prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't just take you through.</v>

499
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:29.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I talk about this when I do college </v>

500
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.270
<v Speaker 2>speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Two years ago or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to say what you said about get </v>

502
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.341
<v Speaker 2>the grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like suck it up and get the green </v>

503
00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:39.201
<v Speaker 2>because hopefully you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to move to Grad school or </v>

504
00:20:39.201 --> 00:20:39.201
<v Speaker 2>get a good job after or whatever.</v>

505
00:20:39.201 --> 00:20:42.980
<v Speaker 2>And I've turned on that really to on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because to me it's like we live in </v>

506
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 2>a time where people can be on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>and expose these things.</v>

507
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Share the emails out on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>periscope while you're in classes.</v>

508
00:20:50.641 --> 00:20:55.641
<v Speaker 2>The teacher is telling you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>an evil white racism videos with my </v>

509
00:20:55.641 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 2>teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the worst thing.</v>

510
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:02.130
<v Speaker 2>But that's been so empowering for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I'm not for telling kids </v>

511
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 2>students not to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I understand the line of thinking.</v>

512
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess it depends on the person or </v>

513
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:11.480
<v Speaker 2>is it's still kind of challenge your </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor while he is,</v>

514
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:11.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just teaching.</v>

515
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I meant more for assignments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if the assignment says explain why </v>

516
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 2>women are oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just do it,</v>

517
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.520
<v Speaker 2>that that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

518
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.150
<v Speaker 2>you're probably going to fail if you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are not oppressed.</v>

519
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the teacher is actually teaching </v>

520
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:26.370
<v Speaker 2>then yes please.</v>

521
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Speaker 2>That is the best time because you catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>them at it.</v>

522
00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:31.471
<v Speaker 2>And I love watching them squirm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love watching them just kind of look </v>

523
00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:31.471
<v Speaker 2>around and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

524
00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a black woman asking me to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:38.491
<v Speaker 2>tell her why she's depressed and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>white professor please tell me what </v>

526
00:21:38.491 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 2>rights you have did I don't have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>

527
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

528
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

529
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:42.550
<v Speaker 2>there is white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

530
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.150
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

531
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel bizarrely empowered because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that?</v>

532
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:53.341
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean someone who's clear on their </v>

533
00:21:53.341 --> 00:21:54.991
<v Speaker 2>political thoughts and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not a victim victim or anything </v>

534
00:21:54.991 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 2>or he's immigrant status or blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

535
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.390
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel very empowered,</v>

536
00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:03.391
<v Speaker 2>like almost like your teachers can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>push back on you in a weird way because </v>

537
00:22:03.391 --> 00:22:04.600
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're caught in their own guilt cycle.</v>

538
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

539
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also funny because,</v>

540
00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:22:07.841 --> 00:22:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I am the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am an immigrant,</v>

542
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:10.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm black and I'm a woman.</v>

543
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like I just have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess most loving and I'm all the </v>

544
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.510
<v Speaker 2>impressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

545
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.240
<v Speaker 2>so it's really difficult for them or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

546
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to limit Stereo Mueller every </v>

547
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:22.860
<v Speaker 2>oppression there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

548
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.140
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

549
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:23.490
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

550
00:22:23.491 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of funny to see how they can't</v>

551
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:27.970
<v Speaker 2>challenge me because a lot of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments,</v>

552
00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:32.971
<v Speaker 2>it is based on lived experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what black people face and I'm </v>

553
00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 2>talking about the Canadian context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Canadian social racial relations</v>

554
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:37.560
<v Speaker 2>is a little bit different than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>states than here in the states.</v>

555
00:22:37.561 --> 00:22:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

556
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me being a black woman,</v>

557
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:45.871
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for them that they </v>

558
00:22:45.871 --> 00:22:47.730
<v Speaker 2>can't give me any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to give me a legit argument </v>

559
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:47.730
<v Speaker 2>because the only argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

560
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:47.740
<v Speaker 2>black people feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

561
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.470
<v Speaker 2>So what is your argument?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

562
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:55.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense it does kind of make me feel </v>

563
00:22:55.471 --> 00:22:55.471
<v Speaker 2>empowered because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny to watch them squirm.</v>

564
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel that you've had an undue </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence in,</v>

565
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I suspect in a positive way on some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your classmates because I'm imagining </v>

566
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:09.091
<v Speaker 2>they're probably learning as much from </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in some ways more than they're </v>

567
00:23:09.091 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 2>learning from some of these professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

568
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:10.350
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

569
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:15.370
<v Speaker 2>it's actually funded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some classes I would have </v>

570
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.180
<v Speaker 2>where a professor will say something </v>
<v Speaker 2>absurd and like there's a student that I</v>

571
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 2>know knows me from Youtube and he will </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at me and I'm like,</v>

572
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anything and then they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise their hand and they'll talk and </v>

573
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:23.730
<v Speaker 2>they'll want me to chime in and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

574
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:28.411
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do this in every class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be challenging my </v>

575
00:23:28.411 --> 00:23:28.411
<v Speaker 2>professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

576
00:23:28.411 --> 00:23:28.411
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

577
00:23:28.411 --> 00:23:33.011
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the fact that I've </v>

578
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:34.530
<v Speaker 2>encouraged so many students step up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually speak up and say what they </v>

579
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.770
<v Speaker 2>believe in and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

580
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 2>it's just really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>

581
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.970
<v Speaker 2>There was a course where one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>textbooks,</v>

582
00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:41.110
<v Speaker 2>I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn it,</v>

583
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.600
<v Speaker 2>this is why school sucks because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you forget everything literally,</v>

584
00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:44.620
<v Speaker 2>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

585
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.700
<v Speaker 2>but one of the students said how it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic and before we just kind of </v>

586
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.390
<v Speaker 2>brush it off and then another student </v>
<v Speaker 2>rose their hand and said,</v>

587
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:52.080
<v Speaker 2>why is it problematic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it looks at me.</v>

588
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

589
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked that.</v>

590
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I've encouraged people to speak up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

591
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:02.290
<v Speaker 2>state what they believe and do more </v>
<v Speaker 2>research and not just listen to </v>

592
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.681
<v Speaker 2>everything your professors saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just listen to anything I'm saying </v>

593
00:24:05.681 --> 00:24:05.681
<v Speaker 2>do more research and investigate and try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find,</v>

594
00:24:05.681 --> 00:24:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get closer to the truth is </v>

595
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:10.680
<v Speaker 2>basically it.</v>

596
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you think students want to be smarter</v>
<v Speaker 1>than this stuff?</v>

597
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:14.730
<v Speaker 1>They're being spoon fed because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely do.</v>

598
00:24:14.731 --> 00:24:19.731
<v Speaker 1>And when I go to these schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see such a thirst for knowledge and </v>

599
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:22.310
<v Speaker 1>honesty and facts and an exhaustion with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this nonsense.</v>

600
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:27.311
<v Speaker 1>But if you listen to the way the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks either about millennials or </v>

601
00:24:27.311 --> 00:24:30.971
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're the spoiled entitled </v>

602
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:30.971
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying,</v>

603
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:30.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>

604
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 1>but I genuinely think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most people,</v>

605
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:36.980
<v Speaker 1>especially young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want real answers,</v>

606
00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:38.960
<v Speaker 1>not just like easy dribble.</v>

607
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:39.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

608
00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:40.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

609
00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of this has to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>student unions.</v>

610
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.080
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking,</v>

611
00:24:44.081 --> 00:24:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously more familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian context of this,</v>

612
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

613
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major schools,</v>

614
00:24:49.361 --> 00:24:51.820
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>York University in Ryerson University.</v>

615
00:24:51.821 --> 00:24:54.400
<v Speaker 2>I go to University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run by black lives matter,</v>

616
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Ryerson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter and feminist,</v>

617
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a university black lives matter.</v>

618
00:24:58.241 --> 00:25:03.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals that are part of the black </v>

619
00:25:03.241 --> 00:25:05.281
<v Speaker 2>lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Original organizations are the </v>

620
00:25:05.281 --> 00:25:07.771
<v Speaker 2>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice president and all that of the </v>

621
00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:07.771
<v Speaker 2>student union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

622
00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:07.771
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

623
00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:11.551
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the debate club for about </v>

624
00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:11.551
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first three years of my schooling.</v>

625
00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:11.551
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

626
00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:13.720
<v Speaker 2>what would be really exciting to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate on racial,</v>

627
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.520
<v Speaker 2>racial issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to.</v>

628
00:25:15.521 --> 00:25:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if I'm on this side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other side,</v>

629
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.800
<v Speaker 2>that would be such a good thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>all we're ever being bad is faced every </v>

630
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:22.800
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

631
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.430
<v Speaker 2>There's some poster about being black </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uft,</v>

632
00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:29.431
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just realized during the trump </v>

633
00:25:29.431 --> 00:25:29.460
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been here for three years.</v>

634
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.750
<v Speaker 2>No one complained and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is elected.</v>

635
00:25:31.751 --> 00:25:33.400
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to be black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

636
00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

637
00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:39.511
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to go talk to the school </v>

638
00:25:39.511 --> 00:25:39.511
<v Speaker 2>president and I said I would love to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this event.</v>

639
00:25:39.511 --> 00:25:40.570
<v Speaker 2>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shut me down.</v>

640
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.060
<v Speaker 2>They said anyone that goes in the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

641
00:25:43.061 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 2>on the opposite side is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

642
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.650
<v Speaker 2>trying to question the humanity of black</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

643
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.750
<v Speaker 2>how dare they try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was sitting there like,</v>

644
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I will be the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

645
00:25:51.371 --> 00:25:52.810
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

646
00:25:52.811 --> 00:25:54.640
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they canceled it and shut it down.</v>

647
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so excited for that.</v>

648
00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you've been pretty critical of </v>

649
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:01.560
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter and I want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that a little bit,</v>

650
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.761
<v Speaker 1>but the moment for me that I realized it</v>
<v Speaker 1>had morphed into something that I no </v>

651
00:26:05.761 --> 00:26:08.590
<v Speaker 1>longer felt was positive because at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning I did think it was basically a</v>

652
00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.610
<v Speaker 1>positive movement or a grassroots </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement that was making some sense and,</v>

653
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:17.670
<v Speaker 1>and addressing some important issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the moment I realized that it </v>

654
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.750
<v Speaker 1>jumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shark was in Toronto actually at the</v>

655
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Toronto Pride Parade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they stopped the parade,</v>

656
00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:26.731
<v Speaker 1>they literally stopped the parade from </v>
<v Speaker 1>marching to demand that the organizers </v>

657
00:26:26.731 --> 00:26:29.020
<v Speaker 1>of the Gay Pride Parade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another oppressed group,</v>

658
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>submit to their demands.</v>

659
00:26:31.811 --> 00:26:36.811
<v Speaker 1>Whatever their demands were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were gonna focus on these </v>

660
00:26:36.811 --> 00:26:36.811
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

661
00:26:36.811 --> 00:26:40.591
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a perfect example of everything </v>

662
00:26:40.591 --> 00:26:41.230
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong with identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the oppression,</v>

663
00:26:41.231 --> 00:26:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

664
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>And then subsequently I saw a lot more</v>

665
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.760
<v Speaker 2>of that style of thinking happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout black lives matter.</v>

666
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 2>But was that moment for you as someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's from Toronto?</v>

667
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 2>We met in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

668
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 2>was that a seminal moment for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

669
00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely hate black lives matter </v>

670
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.381
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say much for many of the other </v>

671
00:27:03.381 --> 00:27:03.381
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but black lives matter.</v>

672
00:27:03.381 --> 00:27:08.241
<v Speaker 2>Toronto is extremely toxic and divisive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's mainly because we were </v>

673
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:11.850
<v Speaker 2>getting so much better in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>racial relations and people were getting</v>

674
00:27:11.851 --> 00:27:14.370
<v Speaker 2>along and there wasn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm speaking for myself.</v>

675
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.730
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't really that many racism or </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist acts happening,</v>

676
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.770
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden they erupt and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

677
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:24.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people feel uncomfortable during </v>

678
00:27:24.771 --> 00:27:26.691
<v Speaker 2>pride because of the police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When again happens during the trump </v>

679
00:27:26.691 --> 00:27:30.471
<v Speaker 2>presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like all of a sudden you're </v>

680
00:27:30.471 --> 00:27:30.471
<v Speaker 2>starting to feel oppressed and it blew </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind.</v>

681
00:27:30.471 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Stopping the pride parade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so confused.</v>

682
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:37.420
<v Speaker 2>They stopped it for like an hour asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>for demands that the police be banned </v>

683
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 2>and it's like being a gay police officer</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that?</v>

684
00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:40.620
<v Speaker 2>And oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they say,</v>

685
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can go without your uniform.</v>

686
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

687
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:48.321
<v Speaker 2>that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is there was a stigma against </v>

688
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:48.321
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

689
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:50.910
<v Speaker 2>a police officer and gay being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you take that away from them.</v>

690
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.830
<v Speaker 2>And there were a lot of proposals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

691
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 2>during the pride parade with officers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their uniform.</v>

692
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.150
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

693
00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.190
<v Speaker 2>what are you really going to try to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marriage proposals.</v>

694
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Marriage proposals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

695
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:03.540
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

696
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 2>this is such a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

697
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:05.630
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

698
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Now they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've actually been banned.</v>

699
00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not coming to the pride,</v>

700
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:14.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think for the next like five years or </v>

701
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.310
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

702
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 2>but that actually was not the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to hate blm.</v>

703
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the Jordan Peterson free</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech event in Toronto?</v>

704
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he teaches at University of Toronto.</v>

705
00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:28.281
<v Speaker 2>My school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is actually when I started </v>

706
00:28:28.281 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 2>making videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was because during the,</v>

707
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.180
<v Speaker 2>the event he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was his first public event after </v>

708
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 2>making the series of videos and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black lives matter was there,</v>

709
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just there are two sides I guess.</v>

710
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:41.130
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't really picking aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was also my very first protest.</v>

711
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I was just there to observe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very confused as to why people are</v>

712
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 2>yelling at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's going on?</v>

713
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have just got home.</v>

714
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

715
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.430
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

716
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I observed the whole thing and it was </v>

717
00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.881
<v Speaker 2>pretty peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people of color went up there </v>

718
00:28:58.881 --> 00:28:58.881
<v Speaker 2>and we're saying things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:28:58.881 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the greatest countries in</v>

720
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially Toronto.</v>

721
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Like this is so diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everyone loves each.</v>

722
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's nice to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

723
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black lives matter,</v>

724
00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:08.680
<v Speaker 2>recalling them coons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're calling them sellouts,</v>

725
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.760
<v Speaker 2>they're yelling all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I immediately knew who the </v>

726
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>aggressors were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I immediately knew who,</v>

727
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 2>which side I did not want to be on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't picking sides,</v>

728
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:18.210
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

729
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.770
<v Speaker 2>I stayed till the very end til the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>person left because this was again first</v>

730
00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:27.771
<v Speaker 2>protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like excited and talking to </v>

731
00:29:27.771 --> 00:29:29.751
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got home and there are articles that </v>

732
00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:29.751
<v Speaker 2>are posted by the school newspaper by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>

733
00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Star about black people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.660
<v Speaker 2>called the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were harassed.</v>

735
00:29:33.661 --> 00:29:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Someone brought dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone brought up.</v>

736
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I was actually standing next to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person with the dogs.</v>

737
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.730
<v Speaker 2>So when apparently brought dogs to chase</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the black,</v>

738
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:45.020
<v Speaker 2>black people complete lies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that opened my eyes to like the </v>

739
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.811
<v Speaker 2>media bias that didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even close to being happening to </v>

740
00:29:48.811 --> 00:29:48.811
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

741
00:29:48.811 --> 00:29:50.860
<v Speaker 2>So it blew my mind that they would lie </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

742
00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:52.330
<v Speaker 2>And then I personally messaged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

743
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.040
<v Speaker 2>the leader of black lives matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>

744
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm disappointed girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

745
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:56.660
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

746
00:29:56.661 --> 00:30:01.661
<v Speaker 2>Why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I decided to start making </v>

747
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:02.920
<v Speaker 2>videos because I said clearly they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the wrong information.</v>

748
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:07.921
<v Speaker 2>The school literally things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson was this Nazi that came </v>

749
00:30:07.921 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and said I hate black people and women </v>
<v Speaker 2>and transgenders and all of that.</v>

750
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.910
<v Speaker 2>So I just thought no one's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

751
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 2>I should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started making videos,</v>

752
00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:20.161
<v Speaker 2>which was weird because I had to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>school the next day and then deal with </v>

753
00:30:20.161 --> 00:30:20.161
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

754
00:30:20.161 --> 00:30:23.500
<v Speaker 1>These people know what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your ass on the line and it's </v>

755
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:23.500
<v Speaker 1>paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

756
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:28.221
<v Speaker 1>So did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you dim the black lives matter </v>

757
00:30:28.221 --> 00:30:28.221
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did she respond to you?</v>

758
00:30:28.221 --> 00:30:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was wanting to me saying,</v>

759
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to screenshot this,</v>

760
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use against you in the future.</v>

761
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you say it to my face?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have it saved because I'm like,</v>

762
00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna save this for the rest of my </v>

763
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

764
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president,</v>

765
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.790
<v Speaker 2>like the cofounder of black lives matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto said she's gonna I should stay,</v>

766
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 2>stay to her face and she's going to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>this against me.</v>

767
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.070
<v Speaker 2>The future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

768
00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:50.860
<v Speaker 2>all I said was I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was very inappropriate.</v>

769
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Why are you telling lies or making black</v>
<v Speaker 2>people feel like,</v>

770
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what actually happened.</v>

771
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:59.881
<v Speaker 2>You're making students feel like that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>why students feel like they're being </v>

772
00:30:59.881 --> 00:30:59.881
<v Speaker 2>oppressed because you're telling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

773
00:30:59.881 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

774
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:04.280
<v Speaker 1>what do you think these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean just black lives matter</v>

775
00:31:04.281 --> 00:31:05.720
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like this,</v>

776
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:10.750
<v Speaker 1>this type of person at a university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's from gender studies or </v>

777
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

778
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:17.080
<v Speaker 1>with all the identity politics stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think they actually want in </v>

779
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.950
<v Speaker 1>the end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they were to get what they want,</v>

780
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.030
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

781
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 2>That's what I don't understand is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are obviously fakes because if they</v>

782
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:29.821
<v Speaker 2>truly care about black liberation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are policies that you could point </v>

783
00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.570
<v Speaker 2>to that you can probably fix and help </v>
<v Speaker 2>the black community.</v>

784
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:36.571
<v Speaker 2>And in Canada one of the things was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>carding and that was actually </v>

785
00:31:36.571 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 2>immediately carding was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Toronto,</v>

786
00:31:38.891 --> 00:31:43.891
<v Speaker 2>Ontario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure either the province or the </v>

787
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:43.891
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

788
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:43.891
<v Speaker 2>but that's the one thing where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

789
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:43.891
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>random stops.</v>

790
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:48.781
<v Speaker 2>I think that's something that you should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be stopped and it's done in inner city </v>

791
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:48.781
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

792
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:49.300
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apart from that,</v>

793
00:31:49.301 --> 00:31:49.810
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

794
00:31:49.811 --> 00:31:52.030
<v Speaker 2>what else do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want black professors.</v>

795
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.880
<v Speaker 2>They want to police out of pride that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not helping black people.</v>

796
00:31:54.881 --> 00:31:57.310
<v Speaker 2>That's not changing their social </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic status.</v>

797
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.170
<v Speaker 2>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your goal?</v>

798
00:31:59.171 --> 00:32:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I really don't understand because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't care.</v>

799
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say I do care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say like I'm,</v>

800
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 2>I have all the solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you what to do.</v>

801
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 2>But they're telling people false </v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions.</v>

802
00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:13.630
<v Speaker 2>They're telling them that we need all </v>
<v Speaker 2>black professors to teach black people.</v>

803
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know what their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what their goal is.</v>

804
00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:21.391
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't get it or you don't get </v>

805
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:22.190
<v Speaker 2>it seriously.</v>

806
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's shift to Jordan Peterson a </v>

807
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.950
<v Speaker 1>little bit because you are a student at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto.</v>

808
00:32:27.951 --> 00:32:30.230
<v Speaker 1>That's where he's been teaching for many</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

809
00:32:30.231 --> 00:32:34.100
<v Speaker 1>This whole kerfuffle over transgender </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

810
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:39.350
<v Speaker 2>All his fault that the school is so like</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's yelling at each other and </v>

811
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.440
<v Speaker 2>hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blame him.</v>

812
00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:42.220
<v Speaker 2>What's the atmosphere like at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>school?</v>

813
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Actually he's not teaching there right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

814
00:32:44.101 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 2>We could obviously he's on tour and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book and the whole thing,</v>

815
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:51.610
<v Speaker 2>but how has the atmosphere change then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's directly related to </v>

816
00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:53.840
<v Speaker 2>some of the stuff that he on earth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it has changed because there you</v>

817
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 2>can see the groups and when someone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>a slightly right wing or.</v>

818
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.040
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate individualism and the fact </v>

819
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 2>that they associate thinking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself with being right wing,</v>

820
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to do that?</v>

821
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:09.880
<v Speaker 2>It should not be anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you want to be right wing?</v>

822
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

823
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

824
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

825
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:18.821
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a little bit more right </v>

826
00:33:18.821 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 2>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they tend to say that,</v>

827
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:24.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a Jordan Peterson fan and you </v>

828
00:33:24.401 --> 00:33:25.130
<v Speaker 2>hate transgenders and blah blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a clear divide you can tell</v>

829
00:33:25.131 --> 00:33:26.450
<v Speaker 2>which side people are on.</v>

830
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

831
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:33.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was bound to happen </v>

832
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.230
<v Speaker 2>regardless and just again because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump presidency to like,</v>

833
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.130
<v Speaker 2>can we just blame trump for everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

834
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:40.210
<v Speaker 2>You're in America now in California too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's how I view it as kind of a </v>

835
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 2>necessary evil that he sort of got this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

836
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

837
00:33:47.121 --> 00:33:48.440
<v Speaker 2>it goes to what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

838
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:52.640
<v Speaker 2>like some of these people get these </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues out there and then hopefully some</v>

839
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:53.840
<v Speaker 2>goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

840
00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

841
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the other thing is trump allowed</v>

842
00:33:58.731 --> 00:34:00.050
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said earlier,</v>

843
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:05.051
<v Speaker 2>to think for themselves in the sense to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that maybe not everything is </v>

844
00:34:05.051 --> 00:34:09.041
<v Speaker 2>how it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe things that I'm learning is not </v>

845
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:09.041
<v Speaker 2>exactly how it is and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

846
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may disagree with his politics because</v>

847
00:34:11.181 --> 00:34:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm a liberal in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

848
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.030
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was bound to happen and trump kind of</v>

849
00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:20.270
<v Speaker 2>shook things up and allow a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are engaging in politics now,</v>

850
00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:23.150
<v Speaker 2>which is so exciting and also really </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary at the same time.</v>

851
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Or is it that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's it right there.</v>

852
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I think just this morning I tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 2>something out to that effect.</v>

853
00:34:27.471 --> 00:34:28.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

854
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.580
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean things are going to be </v>

855
00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:33.580
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

856
00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe things actually are going to </v>

857
00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 2>get better because there's so many cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>new young people like yourself out there</v>

858
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:43.601
<v Speaker 2>putting out ideas like I have hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet doesn't mean that that's how </v>

859
00:34:43.601 --> 00:34:44.690
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might go the other way.</v>

860
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.080
<v Speaker 2>But then the other thing is that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the far left are scared that people </v>

861
00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.430
<v Speaker 2>are starting to do more research you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google things.</v>

862
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays they've started to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they want to control google.</v>

863
00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:01.370
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you can't find any information.</v>

864
00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:02.580
<v Speaker 2>You can only find there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

865
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.930
<v Speaker 2>But now they're changing definitions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

866
00:35:05.931 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Speaker 2>So I mean the definition of racism is no</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer individual.</v>

867
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.720
<v Speaker 2>It has to do with power plus privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>

868
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:14.180
<v Speaker 2>only white people can be racist towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>minorities.</v>

869
00:35:14.181 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Minorities cannot be racist towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>white people.</v>

870
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've also taken hold of the student </v>

871
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:21.320
<v Speaker 2>unions and Jordan Peterson has talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this a lot.</v>

872
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the question that generally was</v>

873
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 2>about Jordan and being a student at </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto that.</v>

874
00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.450
<v Speaker 2>So just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

875
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the student unions are just influencing </v>

876
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.230
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the students and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>influencing a lot of the events that are</v>

877
00:35:37.231 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

878
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:40.050
<v Speaker 2>they claim to speak on behalf of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>

879
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:45.051
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they claim that they're fighting </v>

880
00:35:45.051 --> 00:35:45.051
<v Speaker 2>against racism except they define it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>

881
00:35:45.051 --> 00:35:49.430
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go against someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>says we're fighting against racism and </v>

882
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 2>sexism and every other buzzword that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can throw out there,</v>

883
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:51.600
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

884
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 2>and because they've changed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of racism,</v>

885
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 2>they've started to have events and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a white privileged conference,</v>

886
00:35:56.491 --> 00:36:00.300
<v Speaker 2>which I actually did a video on at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryerson University.</v>

887
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:05.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the way that they're </v>

888
00:36:05.301 --> 00:36:05.301
<v Speaker 2>countering it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're countering the facts with just,</v>

889
00:36:05.301 --> 00:36:09.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that alternative facts with their </v>

890
00:36:09.861 --> 00:36:09.861
<v Speaker 2>own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a BS,</v>

891
00:36:09.861 --> 00:36:11.880
<v Speaker 2>feminist studies ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know,</v>

892
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.680
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the way they're doing it.</v>

893
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to influence students </v>
<v Speaker 2>from schools,</v>

894
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 2>so then when they get out they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>become more liberal.</v>

895
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So the things that Jordan talks about </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he talks about the individual and </v>

896
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:24.490
<v Speaker 1>when he talks about why the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be able to talk,</v>

897
00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:26.240
<v Speaker 1>tell you what pronouns do you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

898
00:36:26.241 --> 00:36:31.241
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see these things as all directly </v>

899
00:36:31.241 --> 00:36:31.580
<v Speaker 1>related to everything else that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about here.</v>

900
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

901
00:36:32.181 --> 00:36:34.010
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's also about,</v>

902
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

903
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.080
<v Speaker 1>sorry I just blanked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were at a Jordan event,</v>

904
00:36:39.081 --> 00:36:41.090
<v Speaker 1>that's where we met about a month ago in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>

905
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And was it a white supremacists</v>

906
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was stoned on my way out.</v>

907
00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but were you surprised at all when you </v>

908
00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.270
<v Speaker 1>saw what type of girl and an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse young.</v>

909
00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I think most of them I've been telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>people it's about 60 slash 40 male to </v>

910
00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:05.951
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's even closer to 50 </v>

911
00:37:05.951 --> 00:37:05.951
<v Speaker 1>slash 50.</v>

912
00:37:05.951 --> 00:37:05.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

913
00:37:05.951 --> 00:37:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty diverse and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone to several events,</v>

914
00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.820
<v Speaker 2>political events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess where I look in the crowd,</v>

915
00:37:09.821 --> 00:37:10.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

916
00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:12.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of minorities here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's women here,</v>

917
00:37:12.161 --> 00:37:13.600
<v Speaker 2>there's men here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's everyone here,</v>

918
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.720
<v Speaker 2>and sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I where I blanked was the idea </v>

919
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:18.790
<v Speaker 2>that you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't debate something.</v>

920
00:37:18.791 --> 00:37:23.791
<v Speaker 2>That's where that was the whole pd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like ranting here so I can get you </v>

921
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.980
<v Speaker 2>all excited because I was there so he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has this effect on people,</v>

922
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.060
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that you can't debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain topic,</v>

923
00:37:31.061 --> 00:37:36.061
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you can debate whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not we should use certain pronouns </v>

924
00:37:36.061 --> 00:37:36.061
<v Speaker 2>because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

925
00:37:36.061 --> 00:37:37.150
<v Speaker 2>you're questioning my identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're questioning me as a person.</v>

926
00:37:37.151 --> 00:37:42.151
<v Speaker 2>My humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They turn it around and make it sound </v>

927
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:44.311
<v Speaker 2>like you hate that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing is it's not like I </v>

928
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:44.311
<v Speaker 2>agree with Peterson or I agree with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:46.150
<v Speaker 2>the students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to hear both sides.</v>

930
00:37:46.151 --> 00:37:47.460
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm asking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>

931
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.480
<v Speaker 2>We can all make an informed conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want you to hear both </v>

932
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.221
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want you to hear their side and </v>

933
00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:56.770
<v Speaker 2>that is the only site you see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened with Lindsay Shepherd as well,</v>

934
00:37:56.771 --> 00:38:01.771
<v Speaker 2>where she played a peterson debates </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're all sides and they don't </v>

935
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:03.220
<v Speaker 2>want you to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only want you to hear their side.</v>

936
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing I hate the most is just</v>

937
00:38:05.291 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 2>the lack of discussion.</v>

938
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm glad you brought up Lindsey </v>

939
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:11.330
<v Speaker 1>because that also is happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

940
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.511
<v Speaker 1>That was at Wilfrid laurier university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a lawsuit that she's </v>

941
00:38:14.511 --> 00:38:16.890
<v Speaker 1>involved in and I suspect I read some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial brief.</v>

942
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:21.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this thing is going to be a </v>

943
00:38:21.891 --> 00:38:21.891
<v Speaker 1>bloodbath diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

944
00:38:21.891 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 1>but what does that say is happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada in a larger way?</v>

945
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I think you've kind of hit on this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

946
00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:27.970
<v Speaker 1>like you guys are almost having like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

947
00:38:27.971 --> 00:38:31.980
<v Speaker 1>like trump hangover or something where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even the black lives matter thing,</v>

948
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:34.020
<v Speaker 1>like it didn't start in America as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

949
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 1>race relations were different in Canada.</v>

950
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I would argue they're still great here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't for sure.</v>

951
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Canadians are just nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

952
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Just generally you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

953
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 2>we've done two shows in Toronto and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows were totally nice and pleasant,</v>

954
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.460
<v Speaker 2>but like we've gone to some other cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

955
00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:53.320
<v Speaker 2>and I find it's usually in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive cities,</v>

956
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:58.650
<v Speaker 2>so it's been in San Francisco and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been in Seattle and a couple of the </v>

957
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.650
<v Speaker 2>others where the crowds are the craziest</v>
<v Speaker 2>most rockets,</v>

958
00:39:01.651 --> 00:39:03.220
<v Speaker 2>which is what I like those because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

959
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.680
<v Speaker 2>they need his message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>

960
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:08.710
<v Speaker 2>you guys were very pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very pleasant.</v>

961
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Think we're getting to a point where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need his message.</v>

962
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:16.501
<v Speaker 2>I think it's getting a little scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with a trudeau our prime </v>

963
00:39:16.501 --> 00:39:20.401
<v Speaker 2>minister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of going to a lot of the </v>

964
00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 2>social justice warrior and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he's even,</v>

965
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:23.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to black lives matter Toronto,</v>

966
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.680
<v Speaker 2>who know the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the leaders said she wants to </v>

967
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:28.680
<v Speaker 2>kill a white man.</v>

968
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.880
<v Speaker 2>She tweeted that she wished she could </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill all white men and the other one </v>

969
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.180
<v Speaker 2>actually stole $300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my student union,</v>

970
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 2>stole it and said that she on her last </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

971
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:42.481
<v Speaker 2>she filed her overtime and she's filed </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of hours of overtime and said </v>

972
00:39:42.481 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 2>$300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth of one of our entire budget of our</v>

973
00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 2>student unions by a third and here's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best part of it.</v>

974
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 2>She files that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's alerts that go off.</v>

975
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:55.940
<v Speaker 2>You can't take that much money for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>are your student union president?</v>

976
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.150
<v Speaker 2>$300,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

977
00:39:58.151 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 2>There aren't that many hours in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

978
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:05.641
<v Speaker 2>She claimed that the majority of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours come from work that she does for </v>

979
00:40:05.641 --> 00:40:06.040
<v Speaker 2>the black community for like black lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

980
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:11.460
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one is asking you that's not </v>

981
00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:11.460
<v Speaker 2>affiliated with the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's asking you.</v>

982
00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you do at home has nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with that.</v>

983
00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:18.650
<v Speaker 2>I always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The school obviously said they wanted </v>

984
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.521
<v Speaker 2>the money back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to sue her and they started a </v>

985
00:40:20.521 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 2>whole campaign saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my university is anti black,</v>

986
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.530
<v Speaker 2>and then they started to put posters up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got gathered,</v>

987
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:28.531
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people saying that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>their only suing her because she's </v>

988
00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:29.190
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You stole $300,000.</v>

989
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.970
<v Speaker 2>You took $300,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Girl like,</v>

990
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.220
<v Speaker 2>are you because you're a black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding me?</v>

991
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Does that not even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

992
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:35.630
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.340
<v Speaker 2>they vandalized the student union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have megaphones starts yelling,</v>

994
00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 2>saying anti black racism happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hands.</v>

995
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:43.930
<v Speaker 2>And it was just this whole ordeal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

996
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh.</v>

997
00:40:44.711 --> 00:40:49.711
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what have you found the best arguments </v>

998
00:40:49.711 --> 00:40:49.960
<v Speaker 2>to get people your age to wake up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of this stuff?</v>

999
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know obviously they're watching your </v>

1000
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:54.990
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably your,</v>

1001
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 2>your prime way of doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you found simple arguments,</v>

1002
00:40:57.281 --> 00:41:01.630
<v Speaker 2>simple phrases or whatever that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>use to get some people out of this.</v>

1003
00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Everything can be explained away through</v>
<v Speaker 2>a social economic standpoint.</v>

1004
00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.740
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the issues that the black </v>
<v Speaker 2>community faces because they're poor,</v>

1005
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.920
<v Speaker 2>which is the same issues that poor white</v>
<v Speaker 2>community space as well.</v>

1006
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1007
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1008
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there examples of black Americans and </v>

1009
00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Black Canadians that do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do well to do well and uh,</v>

1010
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at why they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1011
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have higher education,</v>

1012
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:27.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1013
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:32.250
<v Speaker 2>they're both parents at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were all these different factors </v>

1014
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:32.250
<v Speaker 2>to look at it and then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1015
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.650
<v Speaker 2>so it's not just the color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my skin,</v>

1016
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:36.290
<v Speaker 2>it's either choices or I make or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>area I'm in,</v>

1017
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:39.650
<v Speaker 2>the surroundings I'm in or the school I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to rather than just,</v>

1018
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:41.390
<v Speaker 2>it's the color of my skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1019
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:46.540
<v Speaker 2>but I think you just have to break it </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to that before a lot of people can </v>

1020
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.160
<v Speaker 2>understand where I'm coming from and why</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think a certain way.</v>

1021
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1022
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to just to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1023
00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 2>it's because I'm black and I'm not doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1024
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.200
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1025
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:59.290
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different ways to </v>

1026
00:41:59.290 --> 00:41:59.290
<v Speaker 2>explain it.</v>

1027
00:41:59.290 --> 00:41:59.290
<v Speaker 1>How do you rub up all the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they might say about you?</v>

1028
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Because I have enough friends that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>black conservatives or,</v>

1029
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 1>or are kind of liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

1030
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:08.380
<v Speaker 1>that the things that I see good that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets said about them all time.</v>

1031
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Every time Larry elder comes and does my</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and I look on twitter,</v>

1032
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 1>the things that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that's the suppose ID </v>

1033
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 1>tolerant people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1034
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.600
<v Speaker 1>The progressives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lefties that they say about this man</v>

1035
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:20.580
<v Speaker 1>who I know is being authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1036
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.810
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get a lot of hate comments </v>

1037
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:25.810
<v Speaker 2>where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1038
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:26.690
<v Speaker 2>they'll call me coon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say hate myself.</v>

1039
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 2>I want to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these different things.</v>

1040
00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 2>It's the one part is like me speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way or speaking,</v>

1041
00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't want to say proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>English per se,</v>

1042
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.400
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be something I'm not and </v>

1043
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.251
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you fitting people a race in a </v>

1044
00:42:42.251 --> 00:42:44.441
<v Speaker 2>group?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just allowing white people just </v>

1045
00:42:44.441 --> 00:42:44.441
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1046
00:42:44.441 --> 00:42:46.070
<v Speaker 2>black people are just dumb because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means saying we all act the same way and</v>

1047
00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 2>we should all think the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you can.</v>

1048
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Every black person can be explained with</v>
<v Speaker 2>one statement.</v>

1049
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.970
<v Speaker 2>That's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It let us all be individuals.</v>

1050
00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:57.971
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be fighting for us to be </v>

1051
00:42:57.971 --> 00:42:57.971
<v Speaker 2>individuals and have our own ideas.</v>

1052
00:42:57.971 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Why are we trying to form groups?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they wonder why,</v>

1053
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:05.290
<v Speaker 2>why there's all these like white </v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacist groups forming up because </v>

1054
00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:05.290
<v Speaker 2>you've already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sites thing.</v>

1055
00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.220
<v Speaker 2>You said there's our side and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>your side through like,</v>

1056
00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

1057
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 2>we'll form a group I guess and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>against you.</v>

1058
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1059
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:16.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the hate comments are just </v>

1060
00:43:16.091 --> 00:43:16.091
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ignore the epithets,</v>

1061
00:43:16.091 --> 00:43:18.830
<v Speaker 2>but I do try to understand a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism and again,</v>

1062
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 2>it's just not understanding where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from.</v>

1063
00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:21.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1064
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.360
<v Speaker 2>getting their stocks from the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

1065
00:43:23.361 --> 00:43:28.361
<v Speaker 2>the root.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>or onion is not somewhere to get your </v>

1066
00:43:28.361 --> 00:43:29.960
<v Speaker 2>facts right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you compare those.</v>

1067
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.370
<v Speaker 2>But when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1068
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into a detailed discussion with a </v>

1069
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.371
<v Speaker 2>lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they understand where I'm coming </v>

1070
00:43:39.371 --> 00:43:39.371
<v Speaker 2>from and it's like there's this light </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shines.</v>

1071
00:43:39.371 --> 00:43:40.080
<v Speaker 2>And they do that at my school a lot as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1072
00:43:40.081 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 2>At where someone that absolutely hates </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1073
00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I spend a whole day talking to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end I call it like it's really </v>

1074
00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.440
<v Speaker 2>awful to use this conversion therapy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that we're not electrocuting no,</v>

1075
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:57.040
<v Speaker 2>but by the end of it it's like their </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds are blown because they just </v>

1076
00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.610
<v Speaker 2>believed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black lives matter said everything the </v>

1077
00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 2>mainstream left media have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's.</v>

1078
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just you just got to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

1079
00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're stuck in an echo chamber.</v>

1080
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.040
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

1081
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.210
<v Speaker 1>intersectionality in this combining of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived depressions,</v>

1082
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:14.440
<v Speaker 1>something that will just sort of crap </v>
<v Speaker 1>out under its own weight.</v>

1083
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.600
<v Speaker 1>So like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to keep saying,</v>

1084
00:44:16.601 --> 00:44:18.880
<v Speaker 1>well black people should or this </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority,</v>

1085
00:44:18.881 --> 00:44:23.881
<v Speaker 1>whatever that minority is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should get easier entrance to this or </v>

1086
00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:27.151
<v Speaker 1>access to this or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're actually saying is while </v>

1087
00:44:27.151 --> 00:44:29.791
<v Speaker 1>other people are going to have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished based on their immutable </v>

1088
00:44:29.791 --> 00:44:29.800
<v Speaker 1>characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see this now.</v>

1089
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a massive happening with the Asian</v>

1090
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Speaker 1>community right now in America because </v>
<v Speaker 1>by every metric that we judge success,</v>

1091
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:42.141
<v Speaker 1>they are succeeding at extremely high </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels because of hard work and </v>

1092
00:44:42.141 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 1>education and commitment to family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're going to start saying,</v>

1093
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:44.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to take less of them</v>

1094
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 1>because we have to take more of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1095
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 1>You're actually setting these groups to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate each other.</v>

1096
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so deep.</v>

1097
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're telling one group that they </v>

1098
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:55.120
<v Speaker 2>can't do it on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1099
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.230
<v Speaker 2>there is some studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot who it was who wrote it,</v>

1100
00:44:57.231 --> 00:44:59.570
<v Speaker 2>but it was called the mismatch theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1101
00:44:59.571 --> 00:45:04.571
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the minority students are </v>

1102
00:45:04.571 --> 00:45:04.571
<v Speaker 2>getting thrown in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Universities are not qualified,</v>

1103
00:45:04.571 --> 00:45:05.240
<v Speaker 2>actually turn out worse when they come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1104
00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:10.241
<v Speaker 2>They don't get jobs because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the actual skills that they needed </v>

1105
00:45:10.241 --> 00:45:10.241
<v Speaker 2>to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1106
00:45:10.241 --> 00:45:12.260
<v Speaker 2>it creates this kind of tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you tell someone that,</v>

1107
00:45:12.261 --> 00:45:14.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more important just because of</v>

1108
00:45:14.091 --> 00:45:16.460
<v Speaker 2>the color of your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to piss other people off.</v>

1109
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1110
00:45:17.241 --> 00:45:18.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a way to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

1111
00:45:18.651 --> 00:45:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a way to progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1112
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:22.480
<v Speaker 2>and the whole intersectionality thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1113
00:45:22.481 --> 00:45:24.620
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Pride Parade,</v>

1114
00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I guess in Toronto is an example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1115
00:45:26.421 --> 00:45:30.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like my issues are more important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then obviously the Lgbtq community,</v>

1116
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:35.680
<v Speaker 2>they all hated that and they were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>very upset with it because it's like </v>

1117
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.070
<v Speaker 2>pride is one of the most inclusive </v>
<v Speaker 2>events in the,</v>

1118
00:45:37.071 --> 00:45:42.071
<v Speaker 2>in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you trying to ruin it and say </v>

1119
00:45:42.071 --> 00:45:42.140
<v Speaker 2>this is a black thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an everybody thing.</v>

1120
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.390
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all advocating for everyone here.</v>

1121
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1122
00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to go into ruined </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves that they keep adding.</v>

1123
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:51.200
<v Speaker 1>So speaking of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the thing that you did,</v>

1124
00:45:51.201 --> 00:45:56.060
<v Speaker 1>you were not happy when they put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>black and brown stripes into the rainbow</v>

1125
00:45:56.061 --> 00:46:01.061
<v Speaker 1>flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I also thought was completely </v>

1126
00:46:01.061 --> 00:46:02.981
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole point is that this is for </v>

1127
00:46:02.981 --> 00:46:05.561
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not looking at all your </v>

1128
00:46:05.561 --> 00:46:05.561
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

1129
00:46:05.561 --> 00:46:05.561
<v Speaker 2>Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:46:05.561 --> 00:46:07.810
<v Speaker 2>But reverse segregation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't get it.</v>

1131
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.000
<v Speaker 2>The white privilege conference advising </v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

1132
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Speaker 2>that's reversed segregation and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually gave them the benefit of the </v>

1133
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Speaker 2>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1134
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ignore the name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to actually try to see what </v>

1135
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:19.990
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately the end,</v>

1136
00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.200
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion of this event was listen </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people,</v>

1137
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 2>listen to what people are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anecdotes only listened to people's </v>

1138
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1139
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.530
<v Speaker 2>that's not how you form a society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the majority were white women.</v>

1140
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.560
<v Speaker 2>They were just sitting there hearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people tell them,</v>

1141
00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:40.740
<v Speaker 2>just listen to our stories because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know and we experience it and you know </v>

1142
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.550
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a black spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1143
00:46:42.551 --> 00:46:44.530
<v Speaker 2>there is someone that tweeted during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>event saying,</v>

1144
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm a woman just rose her hand to speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>while white splaining wait for the for </v>

1145
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.760
<v Speaker 2>later where we have our white corner so </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about,</v>

1146
00:46:51.761 --> 00:46:52.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

1147
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:57.990
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of society are we preparing </v>

1148
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.410
<v Speaker 2>herself for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's literally reversed segregation,</v>

1149
00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.450
<v Speaker 2>segregation in the true sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

1150
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.320
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1151
00:47:02.321 --> 00:47:03.710
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1152
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.830
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of the guilty white </v>
<v Speaker 1>allies?</v>

1153
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1154
00:47:08.071 --> 00:47:13.071
<v Speaker 1>when I've had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you met Bret Weinstein from </v>

1155
00:47:13.071 --> 00:47:13.440
<v Speaker 1>evergreen and heather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

1156
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the things that fascinated me</v>
<v Speaker 1>most when he was going through the </v>

1157
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.671
<v Speaker 1>ordeal there was that he said he never </v>
<v Speaker 1>feared the black students physically or </v>

1158
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:24.860
<v Speaker 1>the brown students or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1159
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 1>it was the white allies he said that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of look in their eye,</v>

1160
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:31.420
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that could get violent and I've</v>

1161
00:47:31.421 --> 00:47:32.800
<v Speaker 1>seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that look,</v>

1162
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:34.090
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of that data?</v>

1163
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.110
<v Speaker 2>He treated because it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there,</v>

1164
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 2>if you're not black then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're trying to explain it.</v>

1165
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:43.570
<v Speaker 2>If you're not black then you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience it,</v>

1166
00:47:43.571 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 2>then you don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a white ally you have to just take</v>

1167
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:48.090
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1168
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.850
<v Speaker 2>an activist says to you as fat as this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what is happening.</v>

1169
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the speakers actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did an interview for the Toronto Star</v>

1170
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 2>and they asked him and that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1171
00:47:58.151 --> 00:48:03.151
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you see white privilege in </v>

1172
00:48:03.151 --> 00:48:03.151
<v Speaker 2>Toronto?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said literally,</v>

1173
00:48:03.151 --> 00:48:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said when you walk into a store,</v>

1174
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:11.580
<v Speaker 2>black people or black people have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the fact that people are </v>

1175
00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:11.580
<v Speaker 2>watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1176
00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:11.580
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1177
00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:11.680
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1178
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:16.150
<v Speaker 2>But apparently black people have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>for items in one section before they can</v>

1179
00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:18.880
<v Speaker 2>move to another section so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get accused of stealing.</v>

1180
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:20.310
<v Speaker 2>That's his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

1181
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.170
<v Speaker 2>He got a chance to tell us what white </v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege is.</v>

1182
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 2>And that was his example of white </v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>

1183
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Is that happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no,</v>

1184
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.790
<v Speaker 2>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never happened.</v>

1185
00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I've worked retail for like the most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

1186
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 2>What you're going to pay the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>section before you go to the men's </v>

1187
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.340
<v Speaker 2>section.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what world is this guy living in my</v>

1188
00:48:36.341 --> 00:48:41.341
<v Speaker 2>mind and another one did an article </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's how the outdoors is racist </v>

1189
00:48:41.341 --> 00:48:43.220
<v Speaker 2>and how people feel like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1190
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:48.330
<v Speaker 2>skiing and hiking and everything is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>white space and therefore black people </v>

1191
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:48.430
<v Speaker 2>don't want to go to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1192
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:53.431
<v Speaker 2>who you're saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were the one that are making these </v>

1193
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:53.431
<v Speaker 2>claims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we there?</v>

1194
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:54.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just more division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like,</v>

1195
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:56.230
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it pisses me off.</v>

1196
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1197
00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Because you're visiting La for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of days,</v>

1198
00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a ton of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we could go on a quick hike </v>

1199
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens.</v>

1200
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Black woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just like,</v>

1201
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.360
<v Speaker 2>you're obviously don't care about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>betterments of the black community </v>

1202
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 2>because he wouldn't be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these non issues here in the stage.</v>

1203
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:15.130
<v Speaker 2>You can talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1204
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1205
00:49:16.451 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 2>how old the education system works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can talk about the war on drugs.</v>

1206
00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:23.710
<v Speaker 2>You can talk about the prison system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet the amount of people they got to</v>

1207
00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:28.711
<v Speaker 2>protest the Trayvon Martin shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can get that many people to </v>

1208
00:49:28.711 --> 00:49:31.000
<v Speaker 2>protest the war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can probably make a change.</v>

1209
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:36.150
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to focus on police </v>

1210
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.600
<v Speaker 2>shootings is one of the least things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are actually affecting black </v>

1211
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.841
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yet that's what they want to put </v>

1212
00:49:42.841 --> 00:49:42.841
<v Speaker 2>their focus on.</v>

1213
00:49:42.841 --> 00:49:43.160
<v Speaker 1>So how much of the root of that is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy thinking.</v>

1214
00:49:43.161 --> 00:49:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Like it's easy to get people genned up </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a shooting per se,</v>

1215
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not diminishing that are wrong.</v>

1216
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's easier to take all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdotal stuff.</v>

1217
00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.570
<v Speaker 1>The woman at the shopping center who </v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened to you or that.</v>

1218
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always easier to do that than to </v>

1219
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:04.590
<v Speaker 1>really be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's really look at the prison systems,</v>

1220
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:06.160
<v Speaker 1>which I would be for looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I would be figuring out ways that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do better education to minority </v>

1222
00:50:11.211 --> 00:50:13.250
<v Speaker 1>communities that have been neglected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things,</v>

1223
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but those things aren't really sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not like the things that get </v>

1224
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.430
<v Speaker 1>people out on the streets for more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>

1225
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.660
<v Speaker 1>It's the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of this is just human nature,</v>

1226
00:50:20.661 --> 00:50:20.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1227
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree.</v>

1228
00:50:22.071 --> 00:50:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1229
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I can base all my arguments on </v>
<v Speaker 2>anecdotes,</v>

1230
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.630
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means nothing to me.</v>

1231
00:50:26.631 --> 00:50:31.631
<v Speaker 2>I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well this one day I've lived in </v>

1232
00:50:31.631 --> 00:50:31.631
<v Speaker 2>Toronto all my life and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced racism.</v>

1233
00:50:31.631 --> 00:50:33.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to use that as facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1234
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:38.501
<v Speaker 2>but it's so much easier to do so it's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much easier to play with the </v>

1235
00:50:38.501 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 2>heartstrings and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's really happening,</v>

1236
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just sad that there are actual </v>

1237
00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.661
<v Speaker 2>policies that can be changed or put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>place that could actually uplift the </v>

1238
00:50:46.661 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 2>black community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1239
00:50:47.241 --> 00:50:52.241
<v Speaker 2>none of the people that are claimed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the activist care and especially the </v>

1240
00:50:52.241 --> 00:50:53.770
<v Speaker 2>celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really annoys me beyond seeing Jay</v>

1241
00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:54.810
<v Speaker 2>z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they do is talk about,</v>

1242
00:50:54.811 --> 00:50:56.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black rights and blah blah.</v>

1243
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you use your billion dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1244
00:50:58.071 --> 00:51:03.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create some rehabilitation center for </v>

1245
00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:03.071
<v Speaker 2>people that are getting out of prison.</v>

1246
00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you try to fight for the war </v>
<v Speaker 2>on drugs?</v>

1247
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Like it's all these things where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1248
00:51:06.261 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1249
00:51:06.801 --> 00:51:08.480
<v Speaker 2>it's easy just to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

1250
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:09.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1251
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:11.630
<v Speaker 2>this is what black people experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day and you know,</v>

1252
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:12.890
<v Speaker 2>white people are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end.</v>

1253
00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1254
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:14.370
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1255
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:19.420
<v Speaker 2>it's easier for them to just to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this anecdote and this shooting </v>

1256
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.901
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's affecting us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's so many other things that </v>

1257
00:51:22.901 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 2>could be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of my appearance,</v>

1258
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.220
<v Speaker 2>a university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Hampshire when those kids were.</v>

1259
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one woman who,</v>

1260
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:33.011
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was either a mother of a </v>

1261
00:51:33.011 --> 00:51:33.011
<v Speaker 2>student or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 10 advisors.</v>

1262
00:51:33.011 --> 00:51:34.460
<v Speaker 2>And when she kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1263
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:39.520
<v Speaker 2>these kids pointing to the black kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>could get shot when they walk out of </v>

1264
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.421
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's talking about a university of New </v>

1265
00:51:43.421 --> 00:51:43.421
<v Speaker 2>Hampshire.</v>

1266
00:51:43.421 --> 00:51:43.421
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

1267
00:51:43.421 --> 00:51:48.101
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the only moments where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what to say because it's so </v>

1268
00:51:48.101 --> 00:51:50.090
<v Speaker 2>crazy to say that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be shot and you walk</v>

1269
00:51:50.091 --> 00:51:55.091
<v Speaker 2>out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I maybe said something to </v>

1270
00:51:55.091 --> 00:51:55.091
<v Speaker 2>that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

1271
00:51:55.091 --> 00:51:56.120
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's really dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that line of thinking.</v>

1272
00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:01.180
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was actually having a headline to </v>

1273
00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:01.670
<v Speaker 2>a comedy club the other day and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy on stage.</v>

1274
00:52:01.671 --> 00:52:05.450
<v Speaker 2>He was like typical inner city black </v>
<v Speaker 2>youth or whatever.</v>

1275
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:06.530
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1276
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.540
<v Speaker 2>after he had stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came to sit at my table.</v>

1277
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was gone and he made a comment </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1278
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:16.430
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really hard to be a black woman </v>

1279
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.430
<v Speaker 2>in this country and this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Canada.</v>

1280
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's no excuses for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

1281
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get Outta here.</v>

1282
00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 2>And they asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1283
00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:20.990
<v Speaker 2>how?</v>

1284
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.100
<v Speaker 2>And he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1285
00:52:22.101 --> 00:52:24.320
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to be a woman in black.</v>

1286
00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1287
00:52:24.951 --> 00:52:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I get the whole woman thing because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1288
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:29.000
<v Speaker 2>men are physically bigger and blah blah </v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1289
00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why is it hard for me to be black </v>

1290
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Toronto specifically?</v>

1291
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1292
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 2>cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:35.750
<v Speaker 2>it's just white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1294
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:35.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1295
00:52:35.961 --> 00:52:37.220
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me two reasons.</v>

1296
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Give me concrete reasons could not come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with one because there isn't.</v>

1297
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:43.220
<v Speaker 2>You can't come up with when you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use the anecdotes,</v>

1298
00:52:43.221 --> 00:52:44.390
<v Speaker 2>you have to use the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1299
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.340
<v Speaker 2>if you walk out the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get shot.</v>

1300
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the statistics of people that </v>

1301
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.430
<v Speaker 2>get shot by police?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh seven get shot by police per year.</v>

1302
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:53.690
<v Speaker 2>And it's not recorded by race and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also doesn't tell us if they're armed or</v>

1303
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.720
<v Speaker 2>unarmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven people and you're telling me </v>

1304
00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:58.720
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to walk out the door </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a black person get shot.</v>

1305
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.300
<v Speaker 2>That's not an epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an epidemic.</v>

1306
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 2>The crime in black communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an epidemic.</v>

1307
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:06.050
<v Speaker 2>But you want to ignore that and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about the other.</v>

1308
00:53:06.051 --> 00:53:11.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anecdote that pull at the heartstrings </v>

1309
00:53:11.051 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 2>and make people feel guilty and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a waste of time.</v>

1310
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:17.981
<v Speaker 2>It's such a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what do your parents think about </v>

1311
00:53:17.981 --> 00:53:17.981
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1312
00:53:17.981 --> 00:53:22.201
<v Speaker 2>they are conservative so they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what makes you not conservative with.</v>

1313
00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:24.230
<v Speaker 2>So if someone was to say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're conservative.</v>

1314
00:53:24.231 --> 00:53:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I watch your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about conservatism</v>

1315
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.510
<v Speaker 1>is not that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1316
00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:32.511
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not say you're sort of </v>

1317
00:53:32.511 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 1>putting aside the exhaustion of labels.</v>

1318
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I will say I'm fiscally </v>

1319
00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.661
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess I do believe in like lower </v>

1320
00:53:40.661 --> 00:53:41.210
<v Speaker 2>taxes in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe in the free market.</v>

1321
00:53:41.211 --> 00:53:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I do believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1322
00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.940
<v Speaker 2>less regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that fun stuff.</v>

1323
00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:49.360
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that there should be some </v>

1324
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:49.610
<v Speaker 2>sort of social safety net and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1325
00:53:49.611 --> 00:53:52.820
<v Speaker 2>living in Canada where there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1326
00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.010
<v Speaker 2>free health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not free healthcare,</v>

1327
00:53:55.011 --> 00:53:58.460
<v Speaker 2>universal healthcare and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the universal education,</v>

1328
00:53:58.461 --> 00:54:03.461
<v Speaker 2>the education system is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The funding for the education system is </v>

1329
00:54:03.461 --> 00:54:03.461
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

1330
00:54:03.461 --> 00:54:06.350
<v Speaker 2>So stuff like that where I think I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more liberal where I do think</v>

1331
00:54:06.351 --> 00:54:09.230
<v Speaker 2>the government should help in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's because I'm used to it.</v>

1332
00:54:09.231 --> 00:54:14.231
<v Speaker 2>It's what I grew up with and I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really seen anything different and it </v>

1333
00:54:14.231 --> 00:54:14.600
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>works fine.</v>

1334
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.900
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm pro choice.</v>

1335
00:54:17.901 --> 00:54:22.901
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so stuff like that where I really do </v>

1336
00:54:22.901 --> 00:54:23.120
<v Speaker 2>stand firm in my liberal views and ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1337
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fiscally conservative.</v>

1338
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we're pretty much aligned.</v>

1339
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Finally found somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we can go out hiking or we can start</v>

1340
00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.600
<v Speaker 1>beating people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1341
00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what we're supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you find an ally,</v>

1342
00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.510
<v Speaker 1>then you start attacking other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how it works.</v>

1343
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you want to go with all this?</v>

1344
00:54:40.451 --> 00:54:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen your channel grow,</v>

1345
00:54:41.951 --> 00:54:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I think obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1346
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.840
<v Speaker 1>having you here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

1347
00:54:43.841 --> 00:54:46.210
<v Speaker 1>it'll help boost your profile a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1348
00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.370
<v Speaker 1>You can go into politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>

1349
00:54:48.371 --> 00:54:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Prime Minister of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take out that Trudeau guy with his fancy</v>

1350
00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:52.960
<v Speaker 1>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

1351
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1352
00:54:55.550 --> 00:55:00.550
<v Speaker 1>or maybe maybe Peterson will do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could probably be in his </v>

1353
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:00.550
<v Speaker 1>cabinet.</v>

1354
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1355
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1356
00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying what I'm doing now and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite surprised that people even enjoy </v>

1357
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:11.391
<v Speaker 2>watching my videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's cool to do something you </v>

1358
00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:13.440
<v Speaker 2>love and people like it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really am having fun doing it and</v>

1359
00:55:13.441 --> 00:55:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I think I would probably go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics later in life.</v>

1360
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean I am doing political science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be useful somewhere.</v>

1361
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I've been toying around with law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1362
00:55:22.411 --> 00:55:24.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if I really want to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1363
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:29.630
<v Speaker 2>the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I want to deal with law </v>

1364
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.630
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1365
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:31.590
<v Speaker 2>and I am starting actually a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my boyfriend,</v>

1366
00:55:31.591 --> 00:55:34.520
<v Speaker 2>which I will be uploading very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

1367
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1368
00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 2>the way we should tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still find out otherwise your boyfriend </v>

1369
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:44.001
<v Speaker 2>is white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right into it means you could have </v>

1370
00:55:44.001 --> 00:55:45.870
<v Speaker 2>potentially children who look black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might look white.</v>

1371
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of both.</v>

1372
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:51.120
<v Speaker 2>You've talked about that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter to you.</v>

1373
00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

1374
00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:54.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1375
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:59.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My boyfriend being white has been used </v>

1376
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.210
<v Speaker 2>as like an attack against me saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1377
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.210
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at you.</v>

1378
00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:04.100
<v Speaker 2>What did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleeping with the devil or something </v>

1379
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:04.100
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>

1380
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.760
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a decent fella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy playing Nintendo.</v>

1381
00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:07.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy.</v>

1382
00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.590
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1383
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:13.640
<v Speaker 2>it's the whole idea of why are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating more a divisiveness and then </v>

1384
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:17.731
<v Speaker 2>saying you want equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you saying a black woman being </v>

1385
00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:17.731
<v Speaker 2>with a white man is bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then say,</v>

1386
00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:18.430
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people are mean to me.</v>

1387
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Like you either want equality or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

1388
00:56:21.131 --> 00:56:23.590
<v Speaker 2>You either want individuality or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't pick one.</v>

1389
00:56:23.591 --> 00:56:24.870
<v Speaker 2>You can't have both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1390
00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

1391
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1392
00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not 100 percent sure where exactly I</v>

1393
00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 2>will be in the next five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having fun with what I'm doing now.</v>

1394
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I work for the National Post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I absolutely love.</v>

1395
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I have the podcast coming,</v>

1396
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:42.850
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I'm going to do for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe I might get into politics,</v>

1397
00:56:42.851 --> 00:56:43.420
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1398
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:48.540
<v Speaker 2>it's so messy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you even are go in that </v>

1399
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:48.540
<v Speaker 2>far right now.</v>

1400
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:49.870
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1401
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I hate to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see it now.</v>

1402
00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have somebody to support and care.</v>

1403
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:58.650
<v Speaker 2>You know what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do something in Canada where you run</v>

1404
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.950
<v Speaker 2>and you become something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mayors,</v>

1405
00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.840
<v Speaker 2>something you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will consider moving all my tickets.</v>

1406
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I will give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can pull it off,</v>

1407
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.290
<v Speaker 2>it will be a big freaking test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what happens.</v>

1408
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think I do.</v>

1409
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are white guy.</v>

1410
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1411
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.600
<v Speaker 2>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're done.</v>

1412
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:21.601
<v Speaker 2>You're done for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to start giving me </v>

1413
00:57:21.601 --> 00:57:21.601
<v Speaker 2>like half of your page is because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1414
00:57:21.601 --> 00:57:21.601
<v Speaker 2>racism and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1415
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 2>But I think one thing that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually probably liked to do,</v>

1416
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:28.560
<v Speaker 2>which I probably will not be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1417
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.990
<v Speaker 2>to do a lot of work in inner city </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities because I,</v>

1418
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say I've lived through </v>

1419
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I understand what's going on there.</v>

1420
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1421
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a high crime understand that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some neighborhoods the schools aren't as</v>

1422
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:42.820
<v Speaker 2>good for Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little different.</v>

1423
00:57:42.821 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 2>But I'd like to do some work there where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of tell them,</v>

1424
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:50.731
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got out and here's what I did to get </v>

1425
00:57:50.731 --> 00:57:50.731
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do it too.</v>

1426
00:57:50.731 --> 00:57:51.430
<v Speaker 2>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's opportunities there for you.</v>

1427
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were poor minority child </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1428
00:57:54.701 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 2>please just try your hardest at school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get an education.</v>

1429
00:57:58.091 --> 00:58:01.150
<v Speaker 2>It's literally one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities that you can have.</v>

1430
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:02.660
<v Speaker 2>And you're more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1431
00:58:02.661 --> 00:58:04.810
<v Speaker 2>you're probably not a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>

1432
00:58:04.811 --> 00:58:07.840
<v Speaker 2>but you're more likely to be successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get an education.</v>

1433
00:58:07.841 --> 00:58:12.841
<v Speaker 2>And that's the one thing a lot of black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are lacking is the education </v>

1434
00:58:12.841 --> 00:58:13.480
<v Speaker 2>components.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1435
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:18.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really have like the war on </v>

1436
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.510
<v Speaker 2>drugs and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it really is weird for me that in the</v>

1437
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:21.370
<v Speaker 2>inner cities of Toronto where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>still this very high crime,</v>

1438
00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:22.450
<v Speaker 2>there's still this tension.</v>

1439
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1440
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:28.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard of the Woodson </v>

1441
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Center by any chance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a nonprofit organization that's </v>

1442
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:31.720
<v Speaker 2>located in DC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been working with them for some</v>

1443
00:58:31.721 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 2>time and they basically do the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1444
00:58:33.401 --> 00:58:38.401
<v Speaker 2>They go out to these neighborhoods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they help students and they have such a </v>

1445
00:58:38.401 --> 00:58:41.401
<v Speaker 2>good success rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They held them in high school because </v>

1446
00:58:41.401 --> 00:58:43.561
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing is that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>black kids are not even graduating high </v>

1447
00:58:43.561 --> 00:58:43.561
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're going to go into crime</v>

1448
00:58:43.561 --> 00:58:44.560
<v Speaker 2>if you're not even graduating high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

1449
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1450
00:58:45.461 --> 00:58:48.730
<v Speaker 2>they work with a lot of students there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have rehabilitation centers,</v>

1451
00:58:48.731 --> 00:58:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1452
00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.220
<v Speaker 2>a black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1453
00:58:51.221 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 2>black Americans reintegrate into </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1454
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Like it's stuff like that where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>these root movements that I really liked</v>

1455
00:58:56.191 --> 00:58:57.160
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know it's a,</v>

1456
00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:02.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a big dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's where it would </v>

1457
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.161
<v Speaker 2>probably be happiest is where I can show</v>
<v Speaker 2>people how it's done and help them and </v>

1458
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.240
<v Speaker 2>hopefully everyone can copy that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1459
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're supposed to do and </v>

1460
00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:12.300
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But awesome.</v>

1461
00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.390

<v Speaker 2>you're going to do it.</v>
