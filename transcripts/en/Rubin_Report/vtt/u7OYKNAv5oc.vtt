1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.473
<v Speaker 1>My goal this year with the show is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand on even more topics we discussed </v>

2
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>as well as the people that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:09.804
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we absolutely hit our stride by calling </v>

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>out regressive bullshit and by </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing the regressives,</v>

5
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:15.734
<v Speaker 1>the tide is actually turning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are finally standing up to their </v>

6
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:19.854
<v Speaker 1>insincere attacks and realizing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalism is about the rights of </v>

7
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:24.024
<v Speaker 1>individuals before that of the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you truly believe in equality for </v>

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to defend their individual</v>

9
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's to wear what they want,</v>

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.273
<v Speaker 1>drive a car or marry who they choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their religious or </v>

11
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>cultural background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said there was an awakening months ago</v>

12
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty undeniable right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean we can rest though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>

14
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.134
<v Speaker 1>it means we have to dig in deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep calling out regressive nonsense </v>

15
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>when we see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as I've also said from day one,</v>

16
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I want this show to be a place for big </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas of all kinds.</v>

17
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.843
<v Speaker 1>Over the course of the next few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to people from hugely </v>

18
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>different walks of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative radio talk,</v>

19
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>show host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Elder,</v>

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>science writer and skeptic Michael </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shermer and former leader of the English</v>

21
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Defense League,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Robinson,</v>

22
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.183
<v Speaker 1>just to name a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go big on topics ranging </v>

23
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>from the election to science to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality and more.</v>

24
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>We're kicking off the year with CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Lemon.</v>

25
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.123
<v Speaker 1>Love him or hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don is one of the few people in </v>

26
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media not afraid to say what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks,</v>

27
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>and he often pays for it via criticism </v>
<v Speaker 1>from both sides of the aisle.</v>

28
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Not only does he host his own nightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

29
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>but he also reports on location from </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural disasters,</v>

30
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:34.794
<v Speaker 1>cohosts electoral debates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as even forigin unlikely friendship </v>

31
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>with Glenn back along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know when we see these people on tv,</v>

32
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>we have a way of thinking that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't even human,</v>

33
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.363
<v Speaker 1>that they're just robots or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can assure you from personal </v>

34
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>experience that with done what you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>is what you get.</v>

35
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>We can always mark mainstream media and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we absolutely should.</v>

36
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:55.374
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made plenty of jokes at CNNS </v>

37
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.063
<v Speaker 1>expense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just check my twitter feed at the same </v>

38
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.444
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should acknowledge though that there </v>

39
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:02.274
<v Speaker 1>are many journalists in the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>media trying to do good work while </v>

40
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>online media has changed the way we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the news.</v>

41
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.294
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the big lessons from 2015</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how online media could also be full </v>

42
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:14.304
<v Speaker 1>of crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because something isn't mainstream </v>

43
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean it doesn't push a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>

44
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>distort facts or outright lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As 2016 begins.</v>

45
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Let's all continue to shed light on </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues we care about.</v>

46
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:25.284
<v Speaker 1>Talk about difficult topics in an honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>way and see if we can make the </v>

47
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>conversations in our lives a little more</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened.</v>

48
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.553
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is the host of CNN </v>

49
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self proclaimed king of twitter,</v>

50
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.803
<v Speaker 1>and one of the few guys in Cable News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not afraid to tell you what he really </v>

51
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Lemon.</v>

52
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called CNN tonight with Don Lemon.</v>

53
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

54
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>with Don Lemon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With don limit.</v>

55
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>How long did you have to fight to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in there?</v>

56
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Not that I'm picky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

57
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>it's everything is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all matters.</v>

58
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>

59
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually does all matter and it's </v>

60
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.644
<v Speaker 1>funny that you say that because that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's a good place to start </v>

61
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>because you have been on this upward </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing forever.</v>

62
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>We've known each other for probably like</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five years now.</v>

63
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>And you did my old Sirius xm show a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago and,</v>

64
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>and you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were subbing in for a lot of people.</v>

65
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>You were jumping around show to show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have your own gig now.</v>

66
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:21.754
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.190
<v Speaker 2>It is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.820
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because people will say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been on this upward trajectory,</v>

69
00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:27.270
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

70
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.830
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't feel that way when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>living it.</v>

71
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still the same guy.</v>

72
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm still feels the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

73
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:33.780
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.613
<v Speaker 2>the struggle is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's great to be in prime time on a </v>

75
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:39.420
<v Speaker 2>major network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

76
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of,</v>

77
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get any better than this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A show with my name on it there.</v>

78
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.823
<v Speaker 2>I have no complaints and very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live every moment in gratitude right </v>

79
00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

80
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

81
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.243
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stuff I want it to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first show of the year with you </v>

82
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 1>because you're in the thick of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Like every time I turn on the news and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's going down somewhere,</v>

84
00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:00.630
<v Speaker 1>they send you there or you're at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio or you're interviewing somebody.</v>

85
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 1>So I thought you'd be the perfect person</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of kick the year off with.</v>

86
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:07.100
<v Speaker 1>But let's get a little bit first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the day to day operations.</v>

87
00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:07.934
<v Speaker 1>So you have your show at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in the world of Don </v>

88
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.933
<v Speaker 1>Lemon all day long?</v>

89
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the day,</v>

90
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 2>but I mean pretty much every night I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the air at 10:00</v>

91
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.130
<v Speaker 2>PM and every night between seven and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight I have a rundown meeting and every</v>

92
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.063
<v Speaker 2>single morning at 10:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an editorial meeting and then </v>

93
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 2>sometimes up I try to do the network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a editorial call at nine,</v>

94
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.773
<v Speaker 2>so it can be a very long day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I do radio on some mornings at </v>

95
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all eastern time?</v>

96
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about seven,</v>

97
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 eastern time.</v>

98
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 2>So it depends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a day I do radio,</v>

99
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm up at 6:45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7:00</v>

100
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.143
<v Speaker 2>and I'm giving an editorial and the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the morning show and then I try </v>

101
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:52.860
<v Speaker 2>to read in from then and reads the </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers are at my door and then uh,</v>

102
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I try to stay awake and if I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do the 9:00</v>

103
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>editorial call and then if I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up at 10:30</v>

104
00:04:59.141 --> 00:04:59.974
<v Speaker 2>for my shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>editorial call and then I'll try to go </v>

105
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 2>back to sleep.</v>

106
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.333
<v Speaker 2>But then sometimes other shows will call</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ask me to do live shots to do </v>

107
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>something I cover the night before I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to cover the that night or I'll do</v>

108
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 2>an interview with Donald Trump or are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to a taping like I did today with</v>

109
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Rand Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just really depends.</v>

110
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>So there's no set schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes I get to sleep.</v>

111
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Other times I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

112
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so usually usually I'm here,</v>

113
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 2>I try to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless I don't have any sleep,</v>

114
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 2>the latest I'll get and it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>like six or 6:30.</v>

115
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 2>But usually I try to get in about four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>4:30.</v>

116
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.440
<v Speaker 1>And you're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking naps in the.</v>

117
00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>That is your office right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you at Lsu blanket.</v>

118
00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:36.890
<v Speaker 1>So you do take naps.</v>

119
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Ouch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just before,</v>

120
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just before we hooked up on skype.</v>

121
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we connected on skype.</v>

122
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be careful</v>

123
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 2>out and buy a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know crystal,</v>

124
00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:51.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

125
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crystal came in and said,</v>

126
00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:54.104
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

127
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.123
<v Speaker 2>Don't go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to skype with Dave Rubin and </v>

128
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 2>15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

129
00:05:57.681 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

130
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I know Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'll be fine.</v>

131
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.190
<v Speaker 1>He'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's funny even the way that you,</v>

132
00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:03.024
<v Speaker 1>you started saying hook up there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you immediately have to hedge your </v>

133
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.374
<v Speaker 1>bets because you're one of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want to talk about this a little </v>

134
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:08.654
<v Speaker 1>later on that everything that you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes like this sort of hot button </v>

135
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

136
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>but before we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we delve into all that stuff,</v>

137
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.213
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much news do you actually have to </v>

138
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:20.084
<v Speaker 1>consume every day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know I do an interview show </v>

139
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm in the news constantly.</v>

140
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:26.204
<v Speaker 1>I'm always paying attention to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and on twitter and during this </v>

141
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.414
<v Speaker 1>whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a certain amount of </v>

142
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:30.884
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you only have in your brain to </v>

143
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:33.284
<v Speaker 1>absorb all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to know sort of all the </v>

144
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's going on all the time.</v>

145
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

146
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.300
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

147
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

148
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I consume so much that I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

149
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.851
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

150
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone will say something and then</v>

151
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:46.051
<v Speaker 2>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

152
00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:46.551
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

153
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:47.384
<v Speaker 2>I knew like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like today I was sent out a note on </v>

154
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Wayne Lapierre's flip flop on background</v>
<v Speaker 2>checks.</v>

155
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then someone else reminded me that we </v>

156
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 2>did it before and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

157
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did do that before.</v>

158
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked at why he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

159
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a perfectly legitimate </v>

160
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 2>explanation in his head why he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes you just forget.</v>

161
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

162
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 2>what I try to do quite honestly is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

163
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.953
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to be informed without being </v>

164
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:14.984
<v Speaker 2>inundated because you don't have to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single thing that's going on in </v>

165
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 2>the world and I don't.</v>

166
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 2>My show doesn't cover every single thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going on in the world.</v>

167
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't do a traditional rundown new </v>
<v Speaker 2>show like stack,</v>

168
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 2>like now this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now this,</v>

169
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:28.994
<v Speaker 2>now this is pretty much a theme and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the biggest story of the day or the </v>

170
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.483
<v Speaker 2>hottest topic or the talker of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually we try not to do too many </v>

171
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 2>subjects are we try to make them all </v>
<v Speaker 2>relate and we don't do a lot of stars.</v>

172
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Like traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 2>when peers was here and when Larry was </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

174
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.193
<v Speaker 2>the hours that I'm in now or like very </v>
<v Speaker 2>star heavy and focused and they didn't </v>

175
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 2>do very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we do watercooler talk,</v>

176
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 2>provocative conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have conversations that people will have</v>

177
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 2>at home but not necessarily on </v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

178
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.083
<v Speaker 2>And it's paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And thank goodness our ratings are </v>

179
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing great and you know,</v>

180
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:07.070
<v Speaker 2>we're still going.</v>

181
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of that comes directly from </v>

182
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I remember when,</v>

183
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 1>when you did my show way back when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that was,</v>

184
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:13.604
<v Speaker 1>four or five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that same week that we met you </v>

185
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:16.874
<v Speaker 1>had subbed in for joy Bihar over on Hln </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember we were having a drink </v>

186
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:21.434
<v Speaker 1>and you were saying how much you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it gave you a chance to </v>

187
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 1>sort of be yourself and get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of traditional newsman thing.</v>

188
00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>So are all these decisions in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the format and all that,</v>

189
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>is that all coming directly from you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

190
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.283
<v Speaker 2>shared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it comes from me and a lot of </v>

191
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 2>it comes from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the team,</v>

192
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our staff,</v>

193
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:39.524
<v Speaker 2>the producers and our executive producer</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Wall who's really great with </v>

194
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll have ideas as well.</v>

195
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes like now you know,</v>

196
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.053
<v Speaker 2>it's a no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president is having this big town </v>

197
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 2>hall with Anderson this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made,</v>

198
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 2>he did the Senate at the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about guns,</v>

199
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.133
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about a executive </v>

200
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.660
<v Speaker 2>orders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

201
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's pretty easy.</v>

202
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in Oregon,</v>

203
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>so sometimes it's just pretty self </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanatory.</v>

204
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 2>It's our show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great to finally have a show,</v>

205
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that I don't have to call a newscast</v>

206
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 2>because it's not a newscast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although when it needs to be,</v>

207
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 2>we can quickly become a newscast that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can give you.</v>

208
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 2>I can give you the 32nd or 15 second </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevator pitch between one floor,</v>

209
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 2>biggest story of the day or biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>talkers.</v>

210
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it does not fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're a movie star,</v>

211
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's not,</v>

212
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 2>if it has nothing to do with the news </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not relevant,</v>

213
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 2>it's not coming on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That simple.</v>

214
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.163
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before we get into all the meat and </v>

215
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk politics and guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that kind of stuff,</v>

216
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you get into this thing?</v>

217
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Did you always want to be on TV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you always want to be a news guy?</v>

218
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what brought little don lemon to be over</v>

219
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 1>at Time Warner Center right now?</v>

220
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.403
<v Speaker 2>I was always curious as a kid and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we would go out and about my </v>

221
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:01.430
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write about this in my book,</v>

222
00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:06.380
<v Speaker 2>which is called transparent by the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would just talk to everybody and,</v>

223
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom would like come and grab me in </v>

224
00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:09.860
<v Speaker 2>the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad would always say,</v>

225
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:10.694
<v Speaker 2>don't teach them to be afraid of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my mom said after that conversation </v>

226
00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:16.010
<v Speaker 2>she just let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would just ask people like,</v>

227
00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:18.010
<v Speaker 2>what are you here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you on vacation when you're doing?</v>

228
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.943
<v Speaker 2>I've just always been curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think that I wanted </v>

229
00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 2>to be on television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I liked it.</v>

230
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to be a journalist and </v>

231
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people remind me when I go home for </v>

232
00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:32.960
<v Speaker 2>holidays or just to visit my family that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember even in college,</v>

233
00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:33.794
<v Speaker 2>used to bring the camera to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember we taped this fake show when </v>

234
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:36.374
<v Speaker 2>you were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember you used to carry this </v>

235
00:10:36.861 --> 00:10:39.500
<v Speaker 2>camera around and then a or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember?</v>

236
00:10:39.501 --> 00:10:43.280
<v Speaker 2>We had you anchor our high school and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot a lot of those things.</v>

237
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.380
<v Speaker 2>And so it's always been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.810
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about the gay thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice.</v>

239
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think we had about you.</v>

240
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about your gay thing for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

241
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:55.150
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about mine too if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

242
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>there's so much I can go because let me </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that hand.</v>

243
00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Raise your left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

244
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I got one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

245
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I got one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

247
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 1>You can get one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you just say,</v>

248
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I think if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just on air.</v>

249
00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 1>A couple of days ago you said to </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

250
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:12.174
<v Speaker 1>why would you get married?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you say that to Brook or </v>

251
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:14.150
<v Speaker 1>somebody?</v>

252
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's somebody in the crowd.</v>

253
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Why would you get married?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that I don't want to create</v>

254
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:19.764
<v Speaker 2>another controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the need to run off and get </v>

255
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:23.424
<v Speaker 2>married right away or ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if I'm the marrying </v>

256
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:26.390
<v Speaker 2>kind.</v>

257
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

258
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.580
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole thing,</v>

259
00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:29.960
<v Speaker 1>and I'm pretty sure you'll agree with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this,</v>

260
00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:30.794
<v Speaker 1>is that we should just have the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same rate that everybody else has </v>

261
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

262
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.640
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

263
00:11:34.641 --> 00:11:35.780
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

264
00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's why I don't even want to talk</v>

265
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:38.624
<v Speaker 1>about the gay thing much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could literally do just a minute </v>

266
00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:40.964
<v Speaker 1>on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know I'm just messing with you </v>

267
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:42.950
<v Speaker 1>because we know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

268
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.521
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

269
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.010
<v Speaker 1>but like to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked about this privately,</v>

270
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.080
<v Speaker 1>but like it's exhausting talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay thing.</v>

271
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.943
<v Speaker 1>Gay people shouldn't have to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it any more than straight people should </v>

272
00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:53.350
<v Speaker 1>have to think about their sexuality or </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

273
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:54.184
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically came out when your book </v>

274
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was about four years ago,</v>

275
00:11:58.211 --> 00:11:59.044
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

276
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most professionally,</v>

277
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 2011.</v>

278
00:12:01.891 --> 00:12:03.900
<v Speaker 2>It was funny because I was talking to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend in Chicago,</v>

279
00:12:03.901 --> 00:12:06.960
<v Speaker 2>which was before I came to work at CNN </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

280
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.360
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people were saying don lemon came</v>

281
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:10.440
<v Speaker 2>out and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

282
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Downloading came out dot limon has </v>
<v Speaker 2>always been out.</v>

283
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

284
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.693
<v Speaker 2>since I've been out since my twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't something that I talked </v>

285
00:12:16.981 --> 00:12:17.814
<v Speaker 2>about on the air or shared publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my bosses knew I would bring my </v>

286
00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:24.540
<v Speaker 2>boyfriends to the Christmas party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't a big deal,</v>

287
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.733
<v Speaker 2>but the public didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would host events for like gay events </v>

288
00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:33.060
<v Speaker 2>in Chicago and now basically out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people say,</v>

289
00:12:33.061 --> 00:12:34.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took you 45 years to come out,</v>

290
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.311
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

291
00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:38.520
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I had to do it because there was</v>

292
00:12:38.521 --> 00:12:41.090
<v Speaker 2>so much confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're in the public eye,</v>

293
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important that you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

294
00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:46.590
<v Speaker 2>at least when I came out that you sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

295
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:47.763
<v Speaker 2>you had to make a declaration because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important for young people who are </v>

296
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.660
<v Speaker 2>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who may be struggling,</v>

297
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:54.390
<v Speaker 2>people who may have doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want people to know like,</v>

298
00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a gay person and you can host</v>

299
00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:59.280
<v Speaker 2>a show on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is okay.</v>

300
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the part that I wanted to talk</v>

301
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 1>about because this is exactly what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about four years ago,</v>

302
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 1>that there was so much going on with gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

303
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 1>There was so much happening at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment and in a way as a public person,</v>

304
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like this extra pressure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to talk about this on air,</v>

305
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I have to be authentic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

306
00:13:19.771 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of that did you actually really</v>

307
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:22.144
<v Speaker 1>feel?</v>

308
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

309
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.280
<v Speaker 2>no one forced me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started writing a book about,</v>

310
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of my exploits as a journalist and </v>

311
00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:32.130
<v Speaker 2>writing about my childhood and how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up and whatever.</v>

312
00:13:32.131 --> 00:13:32.964
<v Speaker 2>And I just thought it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>disingenuous to write a book like that </v>

313
00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:37.020
<v Speaker 2>and not included.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

314
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling everything about your life </v>

315
00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:39.990
<v Speaker 2>except for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:13:39.991 --> 00:13:41.790
<v Speaker 2>one important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one,</v>

317
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.210
<v Speaker 2>that one thing that is really important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not all of who I am.</v>

318
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is an important part of my life.</v>

319
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.433
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's important again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for other people to be able to see </v>

320
00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:53.970
<v Speaker 2>someone like me or like a Dave Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

321
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.270
<v Speaker 2>who people who are successful and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>just happened to be gay.</v>

322
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.800
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of pressure on it,</v>

323
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.110
<v Speaker 2>on me and there was a lot of pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

324
00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:02.910
<v Speaker 2>as a person of color to come out.</v>

325
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it cool how it's so irrelevant.</v>

326
00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:06.004
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even why I'm prefacing this by </v>

327
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:08.190
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put two seconds.</v>

328
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He enlisted.</v>

329
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.093
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's irrelevant to you and it's </v>

330
00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:13.970
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant to many people who live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>big cities like you're in la now.</v>

331
00:14:13.971 --> 00:14:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm in New York and when we met with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York,</v>

332
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for us it's easy because there I am,</v>

333
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:23.180
<v Speaker 2>there is no space place where I am in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the closet.</v>

334
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.120
<v Speaker 2>My entire team knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience knows,</v>

335
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.280
<v Speaker 2>my family knows people at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>barbershop.</v>

336
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't really care what you know,</v>

337
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.290
<v Speaker 2>bob at the barbershop thinks about me or</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

338
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.320
<v Speaker 2>of gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

339
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I am completely out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is to a lot of people,</v>

340
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.500
<v Speaker 2>that's not reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's strange to certain people,</v>

341
00:14:42.501 --> 00:14:46.040
<v Speaker 2>especially a certain demographics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain ethnicities,</v>

342
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.993
<v Speaker 2>people aren't quite that out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's easier for you as a white </v>

343
00:14:50.091 --> 00:14:50.924
<v Speaker 2>man to be out.</v>

344
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

345
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

346
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.461
<v Speaker 2>we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

347
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:53.294
<v Speaker 2>So we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll delve into some of the racial </v>

348
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>

349
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.753
<v Speaker 2>my last thing on the gay thing is do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think there is something about gay </v>

350
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.551
<v Speaker 2>people in general that there are so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>out gay people in news right now?</v>

351
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:05.204
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take you and you take cheever and </v>

352
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Anderson and Rachel Maddow and Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robertson and you know,</v>

353
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:13.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a half out guy on Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even.</v>

354
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 2>He may be out already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

355
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:15.794
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even going to name them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even have to smile or look at the </v>

356
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 2>caviar or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is that for some reason,</v>

357
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:22.000
<v Speaker 2>you know Riley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

358
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>

359
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.014
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point that there's a lot of out </v>

360
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.793
<v Speaker 2>people that people get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something comforting in a weird </v>

361
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 2>way or something about gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be my aunt.</v>

362
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Anything there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

363
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 2>There's something comforting about gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

364
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:37.550
<v Speaker 2>We're loving people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving people,</v>

365
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.830
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

366
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:40.664
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those numbers are any different </v>

367
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 2>than any other profession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there have been some people</v>

368
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 2>who are brave enough to step up in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>profession because I feel that if you're</v>

369
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 2>a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take an oath.</v>

370
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm much like you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a juris doctorate,</v>

371
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:54.950
<v Speaker 2>when you become an attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you haven't.</v>

372
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.561
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

373
00:15:55.561 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 2>you take the medical oath when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a doctor.</v>

374
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that journalists really feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

375
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an obligation to inform people.</v>

376
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.080
<v Speaker 2>You have an obligation to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

377
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 2>You have an obligation to be as unbiased</v>
<v Speaker 2>and objective as any human being can be.</v>

378
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.310
<v Speaker 2>So I think that when you're in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

379
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.130
<v Speaker 2>in order to get the truth from people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to be truthful,</v>

380
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:20.420
<v Speaker 2>you have to live who you are and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can put different rules on,</v>

381
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people that you put on yourself.</v>

382
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that maybe people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just more visible because it's a visible</v>

383
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:28.760
<v Speaker 2>medium obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

384
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 2>and I just think that we sort of take </v>
<v Speaker 2>that oath,</v>

385
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:34.310
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are plenty of gay doctors,</v>

386
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:35.144
<v Speaker 2>there are plenty of gay lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are plenty of gay politicians as </v>

387
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:41.840
<v Speaker 2>we have seen plenty of gay people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>clergy and on and on and on.</v>

388
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's any different.</v>

389
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I just think that we happen to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>visible.</v>

390
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.350
<v Speaker 1>For the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's a gay janitor,</v>

391
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.900
<v Speaker 1>so we are out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in every occupation that they're.</v>

392
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

393
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I know gay athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know gay and everything.</v>

394
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.100
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>

395
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's it for the gay thing.</v>

396
00:16:57.501 --> 00:16:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Forget about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's move on.</v>

397
00:16:58.641 --> 00:16:59.031
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

398
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:01.470
<v Speaker 1>so cable news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to ring on your finger.</v>

399
00:17:01.471 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Stop it with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enough already.</v>

400
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cable news,</v>

401
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of the general state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cable News?</v>

402
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Because it gets a lot of crap at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.543
<v Speaker 1>from everybody all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about you </v>

404
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:16.094
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in general you say cable news and </v>

405
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>people start freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

406
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of the general like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of Cable News?</v>

407
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:24.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

408
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:27.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's an easy target,</v>

409
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The media,</v>

410
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:29.764
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media is always an easy target and </v>

411
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.780
<v Speaker 2>so when you're in that easy target that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to be on 24 hours a day,</v>

412
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be an even bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>

413
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.180
<v Speaker 2>And when you're on and there is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>script there,</v>

414
00:17:42.181 --> 00:17:43.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're an even bigger target </v>

415
00:17:44.111 --> 00:17:47.320
<v Speaker 2>because we are human and sometimes many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

416
00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 2>most times there are no words in box to </v>
<v Speaker 2>read when you're in cable.</v>

417
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Now if you're on broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole different story.</v>

418
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing an evening broadcast in </v>
<v Speaker 2>national or local,</v>

419
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 2>everything is scripted for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You read,</v>

420
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing a 30 minute newscast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you read at the most five to seven</v>

421
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 2>minutes of copy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

422
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:07.891
<v Speaker 2>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

423
00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>the big story out West was the flooding </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Blah about Dave Rubin joins us,</v>

424
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:12.930

425
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 2>what do you know?</v>

426
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's it.</v>

427
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 2>And then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you dave.</v>

428
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And now let's talk about the president's</v>
<v Speaker 2>reform on gun control.</v>

429
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.483
<v Speaker 2>And you even talk like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very specific answer for you and </v>

430
00:18:23.361 --> 00:18:23.581
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

431
00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:24.690
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all you're saying is thank you.</v>

432
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 2>And the most that you'll say is </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible report,</v>

433
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Bob Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

434
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.010
<v Speaker 2>When your cable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

435
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

436
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.890
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The facts aren't there.</v>

437
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:35.724
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me get my information where the </v>

438
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:38.900
<v Speaker 2>president said back in such and such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another.</v>

439
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 2>People are screaming right now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

440
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:40.641
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

441
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:41.410
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you talk.</v>

442
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:41.671
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

443
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Now you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot more room for error.</v>

444
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot more people talking back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth.</v>

445
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more interesting to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course people are gonna,</v>

446
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be a target and sometimes</v>

447
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 2>deservedly so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time.</v>

448
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Not really because we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>

449
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.230
<v Speaker 2>we just happen to be on television in </v>
<v Speaker 2>very real moments a lot of the time.</v>

450
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to that point,</v>

451
00:19:03.191 --> 00:19:05.650
<v Speaker 1>how often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I right now in this very second,</v>

452
00:19:05.651 --> 00:19:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I have an ifb in my ear just so that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can hear you,</v>

453
00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:10.570
<v Speaker 1>because it's the nature of how we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing skype.</v>

454
00:19:10.571 --> 00:19:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have one in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

455
00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:12.754
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just doing the skype off the </v>

456
00:19:13.641 --> 00:19:14.920
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things,</v>

457
00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:15.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're okay.</v>

458
00:19:15.941 --> 00:19:16.774
<v Speaker 1>We have proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things I hear all the </v>

459
00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:20.920
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I probably thought this too,</v>

460
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.250
<v Speaker 1>is that when you're on Cable News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on television in general.</v>

461
00:19:24.251 --> 00:19:27.370
<v Speaker 1>There is someone in your rear always </v>
<v Speaker 1>barking orders at you.</v>

462
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.363
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often is that actually true for you </v>

463
00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:30.604
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing your broadcast and </v>

464
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:34.780
<v Speaker 1>someone is actually telling you what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

465
00:19:34.781 --> 00:19:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about the technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

466
00:19:36.101 --> 00:19:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Cut to commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

467
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.170
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people tell you what to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so sometimes you're like,</v>

469
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

470
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people are correcting you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people are like,</v>

471
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.420
<v Speaker 2>they're your other ears are listening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guest.</v>

472
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 2>And then someone will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

473
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:54.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

474
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:55.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna.</v>

475
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.130
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna Affect the fourth amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so the producer will say,</v>

476
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.930
<v Speaker 2>the president never mentioned the fourth</v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment.</v>

477
00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:01.471
<v Speaker 2>And you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

478
00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 2>listen to president ever mentioned the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth amendment.</v>

479
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Or sometimes you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

480
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was uh,</v>

481
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.423
<v Speaker 2>an unalienable right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the producer will say in </v>

482
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.281
<v Speaker 2>Elliot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

483
00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 2>So just little things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

484
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always like to tell people that,</v>

485

493
00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:32.330

<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce now let's go to our panel.</v>

<v Speaker 2>animation.</v>

501
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:49.811
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And they'll go breaking news,</v>

503
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 2>breaking news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll say,</v>

504
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:53.583
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a plane that's been </v>

505
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:55.510
<v Speaker 2>diverted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say there's been a plane that's been</v>

506
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:57.160
<v Speaker 2>diverted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as you're talking they'll say,</v>

507
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now go with prompter.</v>

508
00:20:58.271 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And so all of this stuff you are talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you look up and they say,</v>

509
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joining us on the phone.</v>

510
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:04.310
<v Speaker 2>And they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Williams,</v>

511
00:21:04.311 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 2>they'll say Bob Williams from Nebraska,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Nebraska,</v>

512
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 2>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes you'll be in the middle of</v>

513
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 2>a sentence and people will talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it does happen.</v>

514
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 2>People at home think you're stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually you're not that stupid.</v>

515
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:16.264
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>

516
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.240
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>

517
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.163
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I wanted to ask you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's this sense out </v>

518
00:21:22.471 --> 00:21:26.310
<v Speaker 1>there that you're getting orders of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can and should say.</v>

519
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.040
<v Speaker 1>And what you're really saying is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical stuff.</v>

520
00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:29.874
<v Speaker 1>It's stuff because we have a live </v>
<v Speaker 1>program and maybe they're fact checking </v>

521
00:21:32.671 --> 00:21:33.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not being like,</v>

522
00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:34.814
<v Speaker 1>Don,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better tell him or say saving you </v>

523
00:21:37.291 --> 00:21:37.671
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

524
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.120
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain what you meant by that.</v>

525
00:21:39.121 --> 00:21:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

526
00:21:40.351 --> 00:21:41.184
<v Speaker 1>what I meant was</v>

527
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.230
<v Speaker 2>because someone might misconstrue it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't really.</v>

528
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.123
<v Speaker 2>Everything gets misconstrued and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything now gets taken out of </v>

529
00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:48.844
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

530
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay Dave,</v>

531
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.730
<v Speaker 1>let's not talk about the gay thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

532
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.500
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll just take that and say,</v>

533
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.370
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Lemon zest,</v>

534
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:57.780
<v Speaker 1>shamed of being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

535
00:21:57.781 --> 00:21:59.680
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like a habit.</v>

536
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.573
<v Speaker 2>The sentence in an entire conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we had and then it builds upon </v>

537
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:04.474
<v Speaker 2>itself and it keeps building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a wildfire and by the time it </v>

538
00:22:07.181 --> 00:22:08.014
<v Speaker 2>gets to the end it has absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with what you said and </v>

539
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:12.610
<v Speaker 2>then people believe it because of social</v>
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>

540
00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:15.880
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to explore that somehow.</v>

541
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she didn't investigate that.</v>

542
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.653
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that we've been talking </v>

543
00:22:19.141 --> 00:22:19.974
<v Speaker 1>about here a lot because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I'm seeing all the time now </v>

544
00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.750
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately I see this more on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

545
00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:25.584
<v Speaker 1>is people being misquoted all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no matter what you say and so that </v>

546
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a good segway actually because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you,</v>

547
00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:36.120
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the mainstream media people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the victim of this all the time.</v>

548
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I open up mediate,</v>

549
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Don Lemon says this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Lemon,</v>

550
00:22:40.171 --> 00:22:41.004
<v Speaker 1>this that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or go back and look at the whole thing </v>

551
00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:44.250
<v Speaker 1>of what I said and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

552
00:22:44.251 --> 00:22:45.084
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happened at all dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that kind of time to </v>

553
00:22:46.951 --> 00:22:50.460
<v Speaker 1>listen to the context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you things to do?</v>

554
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.680
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's exactly what your point is,</v>

555
00:22:52.681 --> 00:22:55.170
<v Speaker 1>that they get you on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one liner,</v>

556
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Speaker 1>they know that nobody's going to go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watch the two minutes before the two</v>

557
00:22:59.581 --> 00:23:01.020
<v Speaker 1>minutes after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for you,</v>

558
00:23:01.021 --> 00:23:01.854
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how aware of that do you have to be and </v>

559
00:23:04.651 --> 00:23:06.030
<v Speaker 1>how much are you thinking the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

560
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:06.893
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better not go there even though it's </v>

561
00:23:08.551 --> 00:23:11.340
<v Speaker 1>what I really believe or it's what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to say.</v>

562
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware a little bit,</v>

563
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.690
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that to myself.</v>

564
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:17.524
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to censor myself that way </v>

565
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:21.310
<v Speaker 2>because then you're not authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

566
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever success I've achieved,</v>

567
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:24.394
<v Speaker 2>I think it's been through authenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if I was worried about every </v>

568
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:29.590
<v Speaker 2>single word and how it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course you want to be smart,</v>

569
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:30.424
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you want to be buttoned up in a </v>

570
00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:35.230
<v Speaker 2>certain way or have your facts straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>

571
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.960
<v Speaker 2>And so if you want to take me out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>context and that's your business.</v>

572
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.153
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think for the most part smart </v>

573
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:43.240
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the viewers aren't dumb.</v>

574
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.093
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand what's happening in the </v>

575
00:23:45.171 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 2>stuff that happens online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like twitter and all those.</v>

576
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't usually translate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

577
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:52.244
<v Speaker 2>It certainly doesn't translate into </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratings and it doesn't translate into </v>

578
00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:58.140
<v Speaker 2>credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

579
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wonderful that I work for a network</v>

580
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 2>and a boss who says constantly ignore </v>
<v Speaker 2>the noise.</v>

581
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 2>You guys are doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The network is doing great.</v>

582
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Our story is great right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Continue the momentum,</v>

583
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.190
<v Speaker 2>be yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be smart,</v>

584
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.113
<v Speaker 2>keep moving and don't even read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even matter if we tweet or </v>

585
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>not or we don't have to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

586
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.963
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing and wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a great spot right now and </v>

587
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.570
<v Speaker 2>seeing it so we don't worry about that.</v>

588
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny because on the social</v>

589
00:24:25.081 --> 00:24:26.070
<v Speaker 1>media side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

590
00:24:26.071 --> 00:24:26.904
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could pick something like when you </v>

591
00:24:27.901 --> 00:24:29.920
<v Speaker 1>said that the black hole thing during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

592
00:24:29.921 --> 00:24:33.180
<v Speaker 1>the plane thing and think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on air for hours,</v>

593
00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just throwing out,</v>

594
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody said it could be a black hole,</v>

595
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:41.850
<v Speaker 1>like you weren't saying it's in a black </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole or whatever it is.</v>

596
00:24:41.851 --> 00:24:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know don lemon </v>
<v Speaker 1>is trending and all that.</v>

597
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really can just put it aside.</v>

598
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can because we listened.</v>

599
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.750
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this ad Nauseum at the</v>

600
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:53.583
<v Speaker 2>New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did a thing on it.</v>

601
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that you believe those things.</v>

602
00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.040
<v Speaker 2>We had a thing called crazy conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories that people were sending to us.</v>

603
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of those was that it was a </v>

604
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.660
<v Speaker 2>question from a viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

605
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.523
<v Speaker 2>I've read the question from a viewer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the end of story and that took </v>

606
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.660
<v Speaker 2>on a life of its own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so be it.</v>

607
00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:11.860
<v Speaker 2>It may be famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

608
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:12.813
<v Speaker 2>It did not come from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's [inaudible] positing that I'm </v>

609
00:25:14.951 --> 00:25:15.371
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

610
00:25:15.371 --> 00:25:17.710
<v Speaker 2>look this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what viewers are saying.</v>

611
00:25:17.711 --> 00:25:18.544
<v Speaker 2>They were also seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in a hangar somewhere that we </v>

612
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:22.900
<v Speaker 2>mentioned that there were also saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was a,</v>

613
00:25:22.901 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 2>it was flown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone else took it and hijack did.</v>

614
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.000
<v Speaker 2>There were a number of different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were said about it,</v>

615
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.100
<v Speaker 2>all of which we talked about on social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>

616
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.110
<v Speaker 2>That one just happened to get picked up.</v>

617
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:32.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

618
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:35.290
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a little piece on how I was saying</v>

619
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.124
<v Speaker 1>we need mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also need online media because I </v>

620
00:25:38.591 --> 00:25:39.424
<v Speaker 1>do believe we need both for different </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and different corporate </v>

621
00:25:41.501 --> 00:25:42.900
<v Speaker 1>interests and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

622
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:43.783
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we look as the online guy and </v>

623
00:25:45.641 --> 00:25:47.320
<v Speaker 1>the and the mainstream guy.</v>

624
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.670
<v Speaker 2>We need more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need more honest online people.</v>

625
00:25:50.671 --> 00:25:54.750
<v Speaker 2>We need online people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>online people who will actually do their</v>

626
00:25:54.751 --> 00:25:56.340
<v Speaker 2>homework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who will call,</v>

627
00:25:56.341 --> 00:25:57.174
<v Speaker 2>who will not write an article off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else's article off of someone </v>

628
00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:03.060
<v Speaker 2>else's opinion of what someone else did </v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

629
00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:07.380
<v Speaker 2>People who actually saw the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>segment in context to do their job,</v>

630
00:26:07.381 --> 00:26:10.200
<v Speaker 2>not just like lazy people are lazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just go,</v>

631
00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:10.951
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:12.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm such and such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

633
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that and you're like,</v>

634
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.980
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not so.</v>

635
00:26:14.981 --> 00:26:17.010
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's Kinda hard for us,</v>

636
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.113
<v Speaker 2>for those of us who are in more </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional media to chase all of those </v>

637
00:26:20.191 --> 00:26:21.840
<v Speaker 2>things down and it's just not worth it.</v>

638
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:22.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

639
00:26:22.451 --> 00:26:23.920
<v Speaker 1>you literally took the words out of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

640
00:26:23.921 --> 00:26:27.580
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I'm saying because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think at some point there was the online</v>

641
00:26:27.581 --> 00:26:28.414
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dede was doing a lot of good stuff </v>

642
00:26:30.011 --> 00:26:33.460
<v Speaker 1>getting to stories that maybe hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbled up to you guys yet.</v>

643
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.593
<v Speaker 1>And yet somehow in the last year or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many trashy sites that are </v>

644
00:26:38.891 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 1>just waiting for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for not,</v>

645
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.380
<v Speaker 1>not just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:26:41.381 --> 00:26:42.214
<v Speaker 1>the on air guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for politicians to just find any </v>

647
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:45.684
<v Speaker 1>little thing that they can say and run </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that just so that they can get </v>

648
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:50.730
<v Speaker 1>clicks and they're no longer doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>service either.</v>

649
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it click,</v>

650
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Click Bait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're at,</v>

651
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.060
<v Speaker 2>at the point in here at CNN where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that I'm clickbait.</v>

652
00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Just say Don Lemon and people are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to click on it.</v>

653
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they will say don lemon and then </v>

654
00:27:02.251 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

655
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.550
<v Speaker 2>what I wanted to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

656
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.463
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about online people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so have you ever worked for a </v>

657
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:11.550
<v Speaker 2>traditional network where you work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious?</v>

658
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:13.290
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that's pretty.</v>

659
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:14.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was corporate.</v>

660
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.173
<v Speaker 2>That was corporate is so rigorous here </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I can say anything on the air as </v>

661
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:22.230
<v Speaker 2>a fact or present something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to go through our fact checkers</v>

662
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 2>is it has to go through standards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices.</v>

663
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.193
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what our definition of what we're </v>

664
00:27:26.101 --> 00:27:27.330
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys in Oregon,</v>

665
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.480
<v Speaker 2>what our definition of terrorism is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things,</v>

666
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.533
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we confirm things we had the other </v>

667
00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:35.154
<v Speaker 2>night when Natalie Cole died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was reporting Natalie Cole </v>

668
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we couldn't get in touch with her,</v>

669
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.820
<v Speaker 2>her publicist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the publicist was busy and every time we</v>

670
00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 2>call the phone was busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The email,</v>

671
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:44.064
<v Speaker 2>I guess we could not report that CNN </v>
<v Speaker 2>would not report that until we heard </v>

672
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:51.750
<v Speaker 2>from an official person online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't have those,</v>

673
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to climb those hurdles.</v>

674
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's sad and missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because listen,</v>

675
00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:58.283
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to be first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just want to be accurate and I wish </v>

676
00:28:00.861 --> 00:28:01.694
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish the online people want it to be </v>

677
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:06.510
<v Speaker 2>more accurate than first or funny or </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinionated.</v>

678
00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally hear you.</v>

679
00:28:08.171 --> 00:28:09.004
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I sort of exist in between </v>

680
00:28:11.261 --> 00:28:13.810
<v Speaker 1>those two worlds and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to do what you're saying</v>

681
00:28:13.811 --> 00:28:14.644
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is be honest and have honest </v>

682
00:28:15.941 --> 00:28:16.774
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though I had one of these </v>

683
00:28:17.921 --> 00:28:20.440
<v Speaker 1>things in my ear and nobody's yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they tell you?</v>

684
00:28:20.441 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

685
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.830
<v Speaker 1>nothing they're saying doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a hell of a job.</v>

686
00:28:23.831 --> 00:28:25.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what they just said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

687
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:26.643
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the other thing that I think is </v>

688
00:28:27.311 --> 00:28:31.630
<v Speaker 1>interesting about you is that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat from both sides.</v>

689
00:28:31.631 --> 00:28:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>misquote you,</v>

690
00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:35.290
<v Speaker 1>now I'm talking about if you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

691
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.393
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about black lives matter or you're </v>

692
00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:39.220
<v Speaker 1>taking a selfie right now.</v>

693
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted this for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do when I,</v>

694
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 2>when I post online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

695
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

696
00:28:43.771 --> 00:28:46.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get equal heat from both sides.</v>

697
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

698
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who will look at you as a,</v>

699
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.363
<v Speaker 1>as a black man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to just say racist </v>

700
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:55.734
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just going to come no matter </v>

701
00:28:56.461 --> 00:28:57.294
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there'll be people when you've </v>

702
00:28:58.681 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 1>said things that haven't been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:01.224
<v Speaker 1>sort of in lock step with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the movement that'll say you're an </v>

704
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:05.364
<v Speaker 1>uncle Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm only using that word because </v>

705
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:08.574
<v Speaker 1>when I googled you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the first words that came </v>

706
00:29:10.651 --> 00:29:11.790
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

707
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 1>that Don Lemon is a trademark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That word.</v>

708
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:14.760
<v Speaker 1>But go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:15.594
<v Speaker 1>That don lemon is an uncle Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to me it seems like you're usually </v>

710
00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:19.914
<v Speaker 1>doing good stuff when people on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides are attacking you and that's what </v>

711
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you're getting all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

712
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

713
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing that when I,</v>

714
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.490
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about double standards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations of people,</v>

715
00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a person of color,</v>

716
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.823
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone just to say someone not of </v>

717
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:38.154
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't expect you to be the </v>

718
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 2>spokesman for all white men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

719
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:42.664
<v Speaker 2>Are All,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God they don't even expect you to </v>

720
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:46.320
<v Speaker 2>be the spokesman for gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

721
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this expectation of me to be the</v>

722
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:51.580
<v Speaker 2>spokesman for black people or gay people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I neither what?</v>

723
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm the spokesman for his information </v>
<v Speaker 2>and truth,</v>

724
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.593
<v Speaker 2>and so if black lives matter does </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that is worthy of criticism </v>

725
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:00.963
<v Speaker 2>than it is my job as a journalist to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give that criticism because no movement </v>

726
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:05.584
<v Speaker 2>is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the civil rights movement was a </v>

727
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.650
<v Speaker 2>perfect and received that share of </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism.</v>

728
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.723
<v Speaker 2>So there's a black person in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>position and the only one who is in </v>

729
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:13.150
<v Speaker 2>prime time on a cable network.</v>

730
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.800
<v Speaker 2>When people see that coming from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

731
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.930
<v Speaker 2>how dare he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

732
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my job.</v>

733
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 2>That is what I'm supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

734
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.653
<v Speaker 2>and if someone who is white sees me </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about black lives matter and in </v>

735
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.613
<v Speaker 2>a way that's positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then of course I agree with them so you </v>

736
00:30:29.521 --> 00:30:31.200
<v Speaker 2>know I can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the.</v>

737
00:30:31.201 --> 00:30:36.201
<v Speaker 2>The point is not to be an advocate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who is an activist.</v>

738
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:38.643
<v Speaker 2>My point is to be a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The I get those races and they get this </v>

739
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:42.040
<v Speaker 2>homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism,</v>

740
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.800
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm giving his information,</v>

741
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 2>or if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

742
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

743
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.420
<v Speaker 2>I just received information that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

744
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.263
<v Speaker 2>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the cop in the Michael Brown case </v>

745
00:30:54.161 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 2>is not going to be indicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That word is going to come out.</v>

746
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.293
<v Speaker 2>People who want him to be indicted or </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get upset and call me an uncle </v>

747
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Tom because it came out of my mouth.</v>

748
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.010
<v Speaker 2>And then 20 minutes later when the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out and says,</v>

749
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:08.050
<v Speaker 2>there's no indictment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one goes,</v>

750
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was right.</v>

751
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 2>They just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

752
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 2>he's covering that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe him,</v>

753
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.480
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>

754
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.093
<v Speaker 2>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People take out their frustrations on </v>

755
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 2>the person who was in front of them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been that person.</v>

756
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.583
<v Speaker 2>And do you find that a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's odd that like with the uncle Tom </v>

757
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:24.130
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

758
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 2>that comes from people on the left that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would want you,</v>

759
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people on the left,</v>

760
00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:31.144
<v Speaker 2>they should see you as an individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>except what they're seeing or what </v>

761
00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:34.744
<v Speaker 2>they're complaining about is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be this representative of black </v>

762
00:31:38.171 --> 00:31:41.200
<v Speaker 2>America or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that the people who were supposed</v>

763
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 2>to be the most tolerant are the least </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>

764
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.163
<v Speaker 2>they never consider that they in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>may not be because they think that </v>

765
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.440
<v Speaker 2>everyone thinks like them.</v>

766
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not everybody thinks like you.</v>

767
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.710
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concern.</v>

768
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I find that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

769
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.823
<v Speaker 2>I get it from all sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find that the people who are most </v>

770
00:31:59.441 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 2>incredulous about things and many times </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most vocal are liberals.</v>

771
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and many times for me as well,</v>

772
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:11.650
<v Speaker 2>African Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're looking at me regardless</v>

773
00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 2>of the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if the facts don't pan out,</v>

774
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.033
<v Speaker 2>even if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the evidence and all the </v>

775
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 2>investigations and all the autopsies </v>
<v Speaker 2>show no hands up,</v>

776
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:20.164
<v Speaker 2>don't shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to come on television and say </v>

777
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:23.020
<v Speaker 2>hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't shoot.</v>

778
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what the evidence shows.</v>

779
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 2>So I have to say the evidence does not </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that.</v>

780
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So that never happened according to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

781
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.670
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sell out and you're like,</v>

782
00:32:33.671 --> 00:32:35.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want me to do?</v>

783
00:32:35.711 --> 00:32:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't lie.</v>

784
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's exactly where they go.</v>

785
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's getting</v>

786
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.023
<v Speaker 1>the information from his year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think you've illustrated is </v>

787
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 1>actually not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

788
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:45.164
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people have been asking me </v>
<v Speaker 1>this on twitter and I thought you'd be </v>

789
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:48.873
<v Speaker 1>the perfect person to pose this question</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the way the media frames certain </v>

790
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:53.204
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way the media frames black lives </v>

791
00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:59.741
<v Speaker 1>matter versus how the media is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>framing this Oregon militia thing and we</v>

792
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:01.790
<v Speaker 1>don't have to get into the nitty gritty </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

793
00:33:01.791 --> 00:33:03.830
<v Speaker 1>of every little instance that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

794
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

795
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 1>that the media is not calling these </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon people.</v>

796
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:10.604
<v Speaker 1>They're not calling them terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if this was a group of black people </v>

797
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.860
<v Speaker 1>or especially if this was a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim people,</v>

798
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:16.873
<v Speaker 1>we would be calling them terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was googling the word terrorism </v>

799
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:21.283
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it talks about intimidation or violence </v>

800
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.733
<v Speaker 1>and violence and to me it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>hazy whether them taking this building </v>

801
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.593
<v Speaker 1>where they had to use no force per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently the building was just </v>

802
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:35.320
<v Speaker 1>open and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had guns and it's federal property,</v>

803
00:33:35.321 --> 00:33:37.790
<v Speaker 1>it's all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's actually terrorism.</v>

804
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:38.624
<v Speaker 1>And would the medium be treating it </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently if it was either black </v>

805
00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 1>people or Muslim people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you falling into that trap?</v>

806
00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell me why me out of this trap,</v>

807
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:48.840
<v Speaker 1>how about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the,</v>

808
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>

809
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.173
<v Speaker 2>So I actually wrote an editorial saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was terrorism in my editorial </v>

810
00:33:53.211 --> 00:33:55.670
<v Speaker 2>for the Tom Joiner morning show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

811
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

812
00:33:56.721 --> 00:33:59.210
<v Speaker 2>it was read by someone here at CNN and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

813
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:00.044
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our definition of terrorism here at CNN </v>

814
00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:05.090
<v Speaker 2>is different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it has to be political,</v>

815
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.690
<v Speaker 2>it is political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's political,</v>

816
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Speaker 2>but it also has to have someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been hurt by it,</v>

817
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.413
<v Speaker 2>like physically hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not terrorism until someone has </v>

818
00:34:14.061 --> 00:34:15.440
<v Speaker 2>actually hurt or killed or what have </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

819
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition here,</v>

820
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 2>but according to the law enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>people I spoke to,</v>

821
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.823
<v Speaker 2>if you are doing something for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political end or whatever that is </v>

822
00:34:24.861 --> 00:34:27.020
<v Speaker 2>illegal in that manner than it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism.</v>

823
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:27.854
<v Speaker 2>So I have called a terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard other people call it </v>

824
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:30.404
<v Speaker 2>terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how other media </v>

825
00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:33.104
<v Speaker 2>organizations frame it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here at CNN I don't think there's a </v>

826
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:38.480
<v Speaker 2>double standard about what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it is.</v>

827
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

828
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I know that it.</v>

829
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Would it be different if it was Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>or if it was black,</v>

830
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 2>black people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

831
00:34:46.881 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in America.</v>

832
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:48.674
<v Speaker 2>I know that in this particular case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have to have to hedge it and say </v>

833
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's why.</v>

834
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Because it is in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 280 miles from Portland,</v>

835
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next biggest city Burns is what?</v>

836
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:05.204
<v Speaker 2>80 slash 30 or 80 miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no one really knows where Burns </v>

837
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.473
<v Speaker 2>Oregon is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

838
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.343
<v Speaker 2>So it is basically a truck stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even a truck stop at a rest stop in </v>

839
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:18.200
<v Speaker 2>the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the government is trying to do,</v>

840
00:35:18.201 --> 00:35:19.034
<v Speaker 2>the FBI is trying to do is to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>another Ruby Ridge and another waco and </v>

841
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:25.190
<v Speaker 2>so it is the middle of winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's there.</v>

842
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is in danger of being hurt.</v>

843
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.160
<v Speaker 2>The best thing that these guys can do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>be ignored.</v>

844
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I hate that we even have to give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>media attention because they're Yahoo's.</v>

845
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.160
<v Speaker 2>They're not within their legal rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>for anything.</v>

846
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 2>So I think what they're doing now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly fine.</v>

847
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.213
<v Speaker 2>Let them sit there in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter and freeze their asses off and </v>

848
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.163
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to stay down in the middle </v>

849
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 2>of winter in that little crappy </v>
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>

850
00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 2>then that is your business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

851
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:50.724
<v Speaker 2>it is a federal building and they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking the law and at some point they </v>

852
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:54.144
<v Speaker 2>will have to take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think at this point I think </v>

853
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 2>they're actually doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as immediate reaction,</v>

854
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any.</v>

855
00:36:01.261 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anyone who's called it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a peaceful protest or what have you.</v>

856
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.313
<v Speaker 2>It's it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people who are ignorant of the law </v>

857
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.050
<v Speaker 2>who have taken over a building and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should pay for the pay,</v>

858
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 2>the consequences when the time comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right now I'd say ignore them.</v>

859
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm pretty sure they're not going to</v>

860
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:22.530
<v Speaker 1>get what they want at the end of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's usually how these things</v>

861
00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's many of the people whose land </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saved by the government helping them</v>

862
00:36:26.901 --> 00:36:31.430
<v Speaker 2>out years ago and now they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reclaim it and get the money back.</v>

863
00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:33.830
<v Speaker 2>That the more money that was already </v>
<v Speaker 2>given to them,</v>

864
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.873
<v Speaker 2>they're just ignorant of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this was a building that mattered in </v>

865
00:36:38.421 --> 00:36:40.430
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the city that mattered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

866
00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Reaction will be completely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there would be more direct threat to</v>

867
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Corbett direct threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

868
00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:50.150
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that they're getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass there because of their religion.</v>

869
00:36:50.151 --> 00:36:53.420
<v Speaker 2>They're not Muslim because they're white</v>
<v Speaker 2>non-african-american.</v>

870
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.343
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how different the </v>

871
00:36:55.851 --> 00:36:56.684
<v Speaker 2>reaction would really be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because it's a building </v>

872
00:36:59.301 --> 00:37:00.134
<v Speaker 2>that nobody cares about in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a place that nobody really cares </v>

873
00:37:01.911 --> 00:37:02.744
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

874
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.583
<v Speaker 2>And it's only 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 15 or so people who are actually </v>

875
00:37:05.721 --> 00:37:07.700
<v Speaker 2>in that building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hundreds of people.</v>

876
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

877
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 1>They're running out of snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard.</v>

878
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:12.290
<v Speaker 1>So this thing can't last that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're idiots.</v>

879
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.261
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

880
00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:14.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about some of the things that</v>

881
00:37:14.851 --> 00:37:18.060
<v Speaker 1>bring us together because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

882
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:18.894
<v Speaker 1>what the audience is going to go now see</v>
<v Speaker 1>lemons looking at somebody who's giving </v>

883
00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:23.310
<v Speaker 1>him the signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he can talk about it or not.</v>

884
00:37:23.311 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Someone is in my office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just,</v>

885
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:26.450
<v Speaker 1>we're just laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

886
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.863
<v Speaker 1>so one thing that you've done that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate because it comes </v>

887
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 1>completely with the spirit of how I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done this show is you've really tried to</v>

888
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 1>build bridges with people that perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>some might think you shouldn't get along</v>

889
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:39.774
<v Speaker 1>with or you shouldn't talk with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen you a couple times with a </v>

890
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.343
<v Speaker 1>Glenn Beck and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was tweeting up a storm the first </v>

891
00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 1>time I saw it because I thought this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what the news is supposed to be.</v>

892
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.153
<v Speaker 1>This is what not not reporting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is what conversation is </v>

893
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:54.354
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys come from very different </v>

894
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:57.140
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

895
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 1>he's a pure libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

896
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.773
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your politics are different and you </v>

897
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:03.684
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just trying to have the </v>

898
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>conversation and that's what I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do here.</v>

899
00:38:07.471 --> 00:38:09.350
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was pretty beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

900
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.213
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I don't even know what my </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is as much as I want to see </v>

901
00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:12.324
<v Speaker 1>more of that.</v>

902
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

903
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.210
<v Speaker 2>you say that our politics are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not political.</v>

904
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the least political person that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got on.</v>

905
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I swear I don't care about conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>or liberal.</v>

906
00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I think all politicians are full of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll go with you on that.</v>

907
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.770
<v Speaker 2>And I judge things on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

908
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially coming from an African </v>

909
00:38:32.471 --> 00:38:35.560
<v Speaker 2>American background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>African Americans are pretty liberal and</v>

910
00:38:35.561 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 2>then some things and also very </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative and many times conservative</v>

911
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 2>socially when it comes to the church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

912
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to sit there and pretend </v>

913
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:45.011
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

914
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 2>where do those big liberals and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

915
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 2>and then you don't accept gay people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it.</v>

916
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not,</v>

917
00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not political.</v>

918
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 2>So when you say my politics are </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

919
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:56.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will listen.</v>

920
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.063
<v Speaker 2>I think the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's someone you don't </v>

921
00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 2>agree with or if you consider them your </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy or not on your side,</v>

922
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 2>don't you want to know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking?</v>

923
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people say,</v>

924
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I am never going to talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you?</v>

925
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.753
<v Speaker 2>Don't you dare sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You knew how much crap I got because I </v>

926
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:17.990
<v Speaker 2>like I because I sat down twice with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aaron Wilson and I went,</v>

927
00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:21.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost got the interviews between me,</v>

928
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:22.923
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Stephanopoulos and one other </v>

929
00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:28.200
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was and we all,</v>

930
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George ended up getting the interview.</v>

931
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I got so much guff because I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do an interview with him.</v>

932
00:39:34.961 --> 00:39:35.651
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

933
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:39.460
<v Speaker 2>don't you want to hear from him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even if you don't agree with them,</v>

934
00:39:39.461 --> 00:39:40.294
<v Speaker 2>especially if you don't agree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to hear his rationale and his </v>

935
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:44.074
<v Speaker 2>reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it is never made sense to me to not </v>

936
00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:51.910
<v Speaker 2>talk to someone who you disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's it.</v>

937
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that people should be respectful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they should be in their right minds,</v>

938
00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.493
<v Speaker 2>but you know before you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking to them and if they </v>

939
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:03.250
<v Speaker 2>don't then they're outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll cut you right off if you're.</v>

940
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're being an ignoramus,</v>

941
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not dealing with it.</v>

942
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

943
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:09.100
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even going to bring this up,</v>

944
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:11.350
<v Speaker 1>but a couple months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe two months ago or so,</v>

945
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:12.184
<v Speaker 1>you had a Sam Harris who's been on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>show who's become a friend of mine and </v>

946
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.163
<v Speaker 1>Dean Obeidallah were on and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were debating this Islam and and </v>

947
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

948
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.220
<v Speaker 1>religion verse people thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the midst of it,</v>

949
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.233
<v Speaker 1>Dean said something that I knew to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>implying that sam believed something </v>

950
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:30.004
<v Speaker 1>about all Muslims and I knew it to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>not true because I had sat there with </v>

951
00:40:33.081 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Sam and rehashed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's rehashed it a thousand times.</v>

952
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.090
<v Speaker 1>And while it was infuriating aiding for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me to watch,</v>

953
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

954
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.450
<v Speaker 1>at least they're having the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

955
00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you're just opening the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door for.</v>

956
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing about that is,</v>

957
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.360
<v Speaker 2>is that we have to stop calling people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

958
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Isms or obs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phobias,</v>

959
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.523
<v Speaker 2>not homophobic or Islamophobic or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever because they want to have a </v>

960
00:41:00.171 --> 00:41:01.040
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part,</v>

961
00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.650
<v Speaker 2>that's what we do is have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

962
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:05.930
<v Speaker 2>And when you have great minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

963
00:41:05.931 --> 00:41:09.110
<v Speaker 2>a Fried Zacharia or Sam Harris or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whomever who say,</v>

964
00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.183
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a problem that must be </v>

965
00:41:10.881 --> 00:41:13.880
<v Speaker 2>addressed in Islam and we have to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to do it.</v>

966
00:41:13.881 --> 00:41:14.714
<v Speaker 2>When you have great minds like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the people that you should </v>

967
00:41:16.491 --> 00:41:18.080
<v Speaker 2>listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have people who say there is no</v>

968
00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:20.540
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by you saying this,</v>

969
00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:21.374
<v Speaker 2>then you are as auto phobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that person is very dangerous </v>

970
00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.943
<v Speaker 2>because the evidence is there doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean that people in that religion or </v>

971
00:41:27.291 --> 00:41:29.540
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't mean that that Islam is </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

972
00:41:29.541 --> 00:41:31.040
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean mean that Muslims are bad.</v>

973
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.033
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that because we talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about crime in that is committed mostly </v>

974
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:35.654
<v Speaker 2>by African Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that African Americans </v>

975
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:37.724
<v Speaker 2>are bad or that black people are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that we were just having those </v>

976
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:43.580
<v Speaker 2>conversations and so we have to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

977
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

978
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why I can talk to someone</v>

979
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:49.910
<v Speaker 2>like a Glenn Beck is because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

980
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:50.953
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rather have common ground with </v>

981
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:53.594
<v Speaker 2>people or try to reach some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>common ground or consensus rather than </v>

982
00:41:56.511 --> 00:41:57.344
<v Speaker 2>just having them an enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping them at arm's length and not </v>

983
00:41:58.971 --> 00:41:59.804
<v Speaker 2>being at the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening in Washington </v>

984
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:05.070
<v Speaker 2>and with the Congress right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What good is that doing anybody?</v>

985
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually a perfect segue for </v>

986
00:42:08.211 --> 00:42:09.044
<v Speaker 1>the political climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just talk about that a little </v>

987
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've been in this for awhile.</v>

988
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

989
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could it get much worse?</v>

990
00:42:15.771 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I keep thinking that it's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get much worse.</v>

991
00:42:17.901 --> 00:42:20.390
<v Speaker 1>And now I realize we're in an election </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

992
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 1>We've got this crazy thing with trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

993
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.040
<v Speaker 1>That's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

994
00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 1>You just have to nod through this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing probably.</v>

995
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.380
<v Speaker 1>But really like how much worse is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing gonna get before this election</v>

996
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.393
<v Speaker 2>comes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to get a lot worse </v>

997
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:35.923
<v Speaker 2>and I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of how much it's being amped up </v>

998
00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:42.164
<v Speaker 2>on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whoever's in the White House next is </v>

999
00:42:44.401 --> 00:42:48.020
<v Speaker 2>going to have a huge challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if a Democrat is in there,</v>

1000
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.440
<v Speaker 2>all those people that have been read by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right and by Donald Trump,</v>

1001
00:42:51.441 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people you can,</v>

1002
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:56.740
<v Speaker 2>if you can just go hillary</v>

1003
00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.070
<v Speaker 3>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1004
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 2>can't even get her name out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1005
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Say you say Donald Trump,</v>

1006
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.240
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1007
00:43:03.241 --> 00:43:04.260
<v Speaker 3>I hate that guy.</v>

1008
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.433
<v Speaker 2>You can't even get their name out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think people are becoming amped up </v>

1009
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.233
<v Speaker 2>more than almost any election that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen except for during the Obama </v>

1010
00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:14.020
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty,</v>

1011
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.500
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1012
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Him and Sarah Pailin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1013
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.030
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1014
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.610
<v Speaker 1>In a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it seem like,</v>

1015
00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.453
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like we were all on ecstasy </v>

1016
00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:25.660
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was like seven years besides the</v>

1017
00:43:25.661 --> 00:43:28.300
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if we just romanticize the past,</v>

1018
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:29.600
<v Speaker 2>it was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:30.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1020
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:31.580
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1021
00:43:31.581 --> 00:43:35.060
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't America and he was a Muslim.</v>

1022
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.620
<v Speaker 2>He went to a madrasa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1023
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.710
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1024
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a socialist,</v>

1025
00:43:41.581 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 2>all that socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things.</v>

1026
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:44.320
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1027
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.080
<v Speaker 2>mccain couldn't find a running mate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any found Sarah pay on it.</v>

1028
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 2>And then that was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people said,</v>

1029
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:51.020
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was out to get Sarah Pailin.</v>

1030
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:51.973
<v Speaker 2>And then as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was not as informed as she should </v>

1031
00:43:53.411 --> 00:43:54.590
<v Speaker 2>have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was,</v>

1032
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a little crazy.</v>

1033
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that said,</v>

1034
00:43:58.521 --> 00:44:00.260
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have a trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1035
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.123
<v Speaker 1>How do you deal with this trump thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that I've </v>

1036
00:44:03.381 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 1>noticed and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked about it,</v>

1037
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.240
<v Speaker 2>it makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love interviewing him.</v>

1038
00:44:07.241 --> 00:44:08.074
<v Speaker 2>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>

1039
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1040
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily love what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>

1041
00:44:10.811 --> 00:44:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The spectacle.</v>

1042
00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:14.680
<v Speaker 2>I loved new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1043
00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I love interviewing him because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what he's going to say.</v>

1044
00:44:19.541 --> 00:44:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I love the back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the way his mind works.</v>

1045
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean I agree with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he's like,</v>

1046
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.650
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

1047
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Don.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1048
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 2>people at home are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1049
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:30.880
<v Speaker 2>he cut you off inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of laughing.</v>

1050
00:44:30.881 --> 00:44:31.714
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh.</v>

1051
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.120
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1052
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 2>when he goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

1053
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

1054
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit comical sometimes he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a performer,</v>

1055
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 2>so I love interviewing him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's about it.</v>

1056
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:42.603
<v Speaker 1>So is that really though the secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>sauce to what he's doing that the rest </v>

1057
00:44:45.281 --> 00:44:46.990
<v Speaker 1>of these guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them,</v>

1058
00:44:46.991 --> 00:44:47.824
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that Bernie probably is </v>

1059
00:44:49.261 --> 00:44:52.510
<v Speaker 1>not as Bernie does seem like he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking from the heart and he speaks in</v>

1060
00:44:52.511 --> 00:44:53.920
<v Speaker 1>a way that doesn't sound like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician,</v>

1061
00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.840
<v Speaker 1>but pretty much the rest of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all just sound like politicians and</v>

1062
00:44:58.841 --> 00:45:02.050
<v Speaker 1>people are over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

1063
00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:05.950
<v Speaker 1>even when trump says crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes people like him,</v>

1064
00:45:05.951 --> 00:45:10.870
<v Speaker 1>like we had this like a thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like eating itself constantly with him.</v>

1065
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.490
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1066
00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.770
<v Speaker 2>I tell people this because I use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick them off,</v>

1067
00:45:14.771 --> 00:45:16.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They usually tell like people who are on</v>

1068
00:45:16.301 --> 00:45:18.890
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president trump get used to it.</v>

1069
00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:20.043
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1070
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1071
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:22.614
<v Speaker 2>I had never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had not underestimated him since he </v>

1072
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:27.420
<v Speaker 2>got into the race because here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said this from the beginning,</v>

1073
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:28.860
<v Speaker 2>you can probably find it on tape </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

1074
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:34.040
<v Speaker 2>He's used to swimming in these New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>media waters.</v>

1075
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1076
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.910
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to handle them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate the media.</v>

1077
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.730
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to cut a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1078
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.680
<v Speaker 2>if you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can make it there,</v>

1079
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:44.514
<v Speaker 2>you can make it anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy has made it with help from his </v>

1080
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:48.030
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1081
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1082
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's made it here.</v>

1083
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.040
<v Speaker 2>He's become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1084
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:56.040
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the food chain and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>media food chain here.</v>

1085
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to deal with the media and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1086
00:45:58.741 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 2>and he's got a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it,</v>

1087
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.303
<v Speaker 2>of running for president is having a ton</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dough and he has a ton of dough and </v>

1088
00:46:05.341 --> 00:46:06.174
<v Speaker 2>he knows how to deal with people and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a good year on what people want to </v>

1089
00:46:10.711 --> 00:46:12.260
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he's in front of a crowd,</v>

1090
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.571
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1091
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:13.404
<v Speaker 2>they liked that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

1092
00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 2>And it gives them more or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that so much.</v>

1093
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.523
<v Speaker 2>He changes the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So having known all of that and being </v>

1094
00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:22.040
<v Speaker 2>here in the nineties and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and knowing Donald Trump,</v>

1095
00:46:22.041 --> 00:46:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy isn't going anywhere.</v>

1096
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.740
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

1097
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all right.</v>

1098
00:46:27.331 --> 00:46:28.164
<v Speaker 1>I got just a couple more for you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you have to actually be blowing </v>

1099
00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:33.540
<v Speaker 1>me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be live on air.</v>

1100
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too.</v>

1101
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Not too long from now and about two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and 15.</v>

1102
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got plenty.</v>

1103
00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.151
<v Speaker 1>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen.</v>

1104
00:46:39.151 --> 00:46:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk as long as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1105
00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:42.630
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1106
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:43.763
<v Speaker 1>how much do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my major issues is when I watch </v>

1107
00:46:46.651 --> 00:46:48.140
<v Speaker 1>something live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1108
00:46:48.141 --> 00:46:49.050
<v Speaker 1>I know we're not lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>

1109
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1110
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I watched something like the,</v>

1111
00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:53.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:54.144
<v Speaker 1>the press club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the yearly thing where the media gets </v>

1113
00:46:56.071 --> 00:46:57.710
<v Speaker 1>together and rose to the politicians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1114
00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.010
<v Speaker 1>what's it called at the press club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1115
00:46:59.011 --> 00:47:00.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my last correspondence,</v>

1116
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.530
<v Speaker 1>the White House correspondence dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

1117
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.050
<v Speaker 1>When I watch all of this stuff and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you a couple of weeks ago at,</v>

1118
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:06.933
<v Speaker 1>in the spin room at the debate in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were at the democratic debate there </v>

1119
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 1>and I've been around it a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>

1120
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:13.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I really do fear </v>

1121
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:16.283
<v Speaker 1>is that the media and the politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just in it too tightly that people </v>

1122
00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 1>are just too friendly with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually,</v>

1123
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have so many instances of people that</v>

1124
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 1>are married to people on television and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the kids.</v>

1125
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>And this one or the uncle of that one on</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff.</v>

1126
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.193
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure no one in your family's </v>

1127
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>pulling strings in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1128
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's get that out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for my cousin brock.</v>

1129
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.740
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course he's your cousin,</v>

1130
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 1>of course these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1131
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.283
<v Speaker 1>But really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you see that as an actual threat </v>

1132
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:49.744
<v Speaker 1>to democracy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that I really see as a major </v>

1133
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:52.084
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1134
00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I would call it a threat</v>

1135
00:47:54.241 --> 00:47:56.880
<v Speaker 2>to democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do see it as um,</v>

1136
00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a little fake and phony to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1137
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was great going to,</v>

1138
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being invited to the White House </v>

1139
00:48:04.051 --> 00:48:04.884
<v Speaker 2>correspondence dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a lot more fun when I was </v>

1140
00:48:07.201 --> 00:48:09.000
<v Speaker 2>covering it and I can make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1141
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1142
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.790
<v Speaker 1>So how much does that make you bite your</v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue?</v>

1143
00:48:11.791 --> 00:48:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to go to the dinners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1144
00:48:13.261 --> 00:48:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Like we've all been around.</v>

1145
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I went to the White House Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 2>party,</v>

1146
00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:18.644
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because I knew the Obama from </v>

1147
00:48:20.301 --> 00:48:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Chicago and it was tough and I said this</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1148
00:48:23.331 --> 00:48:26.840
<v Speaker 2>like when you know someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I didn't know them that well.</v>

1149
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.300
<v Speaker 2>They weren't my best friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew them from around the way.</v>

1150
00:48:29.301 --> 00:48:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Right from being I was a local news </v>
<v Speaker 2>anchor and they were there,</v>

1151
00:48:32.381 --> 00:48:33.214
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1152
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.073
<v Speaker 2>that would introduce them at chicken </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinners like emo state Senator Barack </v>

1153
00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Obama and Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then his wife would always say,</v>

1154
00:48:39.771 --> 00:48:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh don,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay out of trouble.</v>

1155
00:48:40.821 --> 00:48:41.241
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who?</v>

1156
00:48:41.241 --> 00:48:42.074
<v Speaker 2>Me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1157
00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.380
<v Speaker 2>So to have to sort of criticize him on </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy and the things it was,</v>

1158
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:48.363
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first it was uncomfortable in </v>

1159
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.833
<v Speaker 2>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the president and the buck stops </v>

1160
00:48:51.021 --> 00:48:51.970
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've got,</v>

1161
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ease,</v>

1162
00:48:52.851 --> 00:48:53.684
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1163
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:55.340
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a journalist,</v>

1164
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.203
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took an oath and so when I saw him </v>

1165
00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.223
<v Speaker 2>sort of in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an informal context and not like </v>

1166
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.793
<v Speaker 2>throwing questions at him or seeing him </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end a Bj and like yelling across </v>

1167
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:06.890
<v Speaker 2>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1168
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:07.910
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to handle this?</v>

1169
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:08.743
<v Speaker 2>And having them yell back when I had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go and shake their hand and take a </v>

1170
00:49:11.301 --> 00:49:12.250
<v Speaker 2>picture with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1171
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:16.860
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they going to say it?</v>

1172
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.550
<v Speaker 2>So I walked up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

1173
00:49:19.551 --> 00:49:20.450
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1174
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:24.260
<v Speaker 2>you did the right thing by coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like thank you.</v>

1175
00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they get it,</v>

1176
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:26.833
<v Speaker 2>they get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a little weird and I felt </v>

1177
00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:28.964
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know if I should be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to winning in this sort of </v>

1178
00:49:32.661 --> 00:49:35.650
<v Speaker 2>situation to be partying with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president or for that matter,</v>

1179
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.490
<v Speaker 2>partying with some of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1180
00:49:37.491 --> 00:49:39.110
<v Speaker 2>when you go to the Oscars and all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1181
00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:39.973
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like I kind of feel like </v>

1182
00:49:40.881 --> 00:49:41.780
<v Speaker 2>Wendy Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1183
00:49:41.781 --> 00:49:42.614
<v Speaker 2>Who Sits on her purple chair and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>liked talks smack about everybody and </v>

1184
00:49:46.131 --> 00:49:48.350
<v Speaker 2>then when they see her or when she sees </v>
<v Speaker 2>him she's like,</v>

1185
00:49:48.351 --> 00:49:48.690
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

1186
00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Or I kind of feel like that a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1187
00:49:51.961 --> 00:49:56.190
<v Speaker 1>So don't you think that more you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>need that sense?</v>

1188
00:49:56.191 --> 00:49:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Because I totally feel like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:49:59.671 --> 00:50:00.504
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean just the at the friendly </v>

1190
00:50:01.831 --> 00:50:02.740
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1191
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.481
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to.</v>

1192
00:50:03.481 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to name names or people </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1193
00:50:05.551 --> 00:50:09.390
<v Speaker 1>but there are plenty of anchors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally used to work on campaigns for.</v>

1194
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.560
<v Speaker 1>For President or I mean you can name </v>
<v Speaker 1>some names or look a little weird to me.</v>

1195
00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean somebody like a,</v>

1196
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:18.040
<v Speaker 1>you know Stephanopoulos right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

1197
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.050
<v Speaker 2>is Diane Sawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a George will.</v>

1198
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean even in George will is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentator,</v>

1199
00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.293
<v Speaker 2>a David Gergen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's accommodated Donna Brazil </v>

1200
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.750
<v Speaker 2>commentator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>

1201
00:50:26.751 --> 00:50:28.970
<v Speaker 2>But when you're a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there are plenty of journalists</v>

1202
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:31.280
<v Speaker 2>who have worked for campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1203
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.700
<v Speaker 1>but when you're a commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1204
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.500
<v Speaker 1>how different do you actually think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>

1205
00:50:34.501 --> 00:50:35.334
<v Speaker 1>So somebody like Don Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think they have a certain </v>

1206
00:50:38.941 --> 00:50:40.770
<v Speaker 1>amount allegiance for a campaign that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

1207
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:43.060
<v Speaker 1>that they worked on previously that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

1208
00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1209
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we hire them because they not</v>

1210
00:50:47.191 --> 00:50:48.024
<v Speaker 2>because they have allegiance because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have knowledge to that person or </v>

1211
00:50:49.801 --> 00:50:50.880
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will say,</v>

1212
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Donna Brazil worked for the Al Gore </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>

1213
00:50:54.211 --> 00:50:56.250
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows that.</v>

1214
00:50:56.251 --> 00:50:58.890
<v Speaker 2>So she can offer insight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also with it,</v>

1215
00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:00.300
<v Speaker 2>unless you're crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1216
00:51:00.301 --> 00:51:02.400
<v Speaker 2>that her allegiance would be to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1217
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:03.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Al Gore.</v>

1218
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.753
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's totally different because </v>

1219
00:51:06.061 --> 00:51:06.894
<v Speaker 2>when you're a commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hired to commentate as they say </v>

1220
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:10.910
<v Speaker 2>or to comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1221
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.810
<v Speaker 2>and to give your opinion as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist,</v>

1222
00:51:12.811 --> 00:51:14.580
<v Speaker 2>you're not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not your role.</v>

1223
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're pretty much right.</v>

1224
00:51:16.591 --> 00:51:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're right in between </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two things.</v>

1225
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it on CNN.</v>

1226
00:51:21.301 --> 00:51:26.301
<v Speaker 2>What I do is I do and more of a point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>view on I am hired as to give commentary</v>

1227
00:51:28.531 --> 00:51:31.860
<v Speaker 2>on the Tom Joiner morning show radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>show which had to be approved by CNN.</v>

1228
00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.790
<v Speaker 2>So I feel free and different in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>zone to give.</v>

1229
00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:39.670
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm on CNN I have to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself because that's not exactly what I</v>

1230
00:51:39.671 --> 00:51:40.504
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everyone has a certain lens and </v>

1231
00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:44.154
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a certain background and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a point of view and I think </v>

1232
00:51:47.911 --> 00:51:51.480
<v Speaker 2>that's okay as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you let people know that and.</v>

1233
00:51:51.481 --> 00:51:54.110
<v Speaker 2>But that's nothing new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1234
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Merle Cronkite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those guys gave commentary.</v>

1235
00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:57.961
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1236
00:51:57.961 --> 00:52:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I always do think that's funny when some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these people on tv,</v>

1237
00:52:01.171 --> 00:52:02.220
<v Speaker 1>you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1238
00:52:02.221 --> 00:52:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't share any of my opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1239
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:05.363
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much impossible actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if for no other reason than your </v>

1240
00:52:08.731 --> 00:52:10.500
<v Speaker 1>body language when you're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

1241
00:52:10.501 --> 00:52:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1242
00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:11.973
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1243
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1244
00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see anything wrong with it,</v>

1245
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 2>especially if you declare it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I had,</v>

1246
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:17.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1247
00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:18.480
<v Speaker 2>when people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1248
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Fox is to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1249
00:52:19.731 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They let you know,</v>

1250
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.640
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC is to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1251
00:52:22.641 --> 00:52:23.474
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They let you know and we are neither </v>

1252
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:28.760
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to be objective at CNN,</v>

1253
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.713
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want people to have an in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our objectivity to let people run all </v>

1254
00:52:32.391 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 2>over reality and truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1255
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1256
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.020
<v Speaker 1>so I should tell everybody that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we started the recording here,</v>

1257
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said to me,</v>

1258
00:52:41.161 --> 00:52:45.270
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said to you that I knew with you I</v>

1259
00:52:45.271 --> 00:52:46.240
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1260
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times I'll tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess our,</v>

1261
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.080
<v Speaker 1>we're going to touch on these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1262
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.150
<v Speaker 1>but I knew if you knew that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be cool with that,</v>

1263
00:52:51.151 --> 00:52:51.984
<v Speaker 1>so I hope that that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my audience to know that because </v>

1264
00:52:53.881 --> 00:52:54.714
<v Speaker 1>I hope that alone will dispel some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff about sort of how a lot of </v>

1265
00:52:58.681 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you guys have to operate or at least how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to operate.</v>

1266
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Because [inaudible] the person that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know off the camera is the same guy that</v>

1267
00:53:03.481 --> 00:53:04.314
<v Speaker 1>I know right this second.</v>

1268
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:05.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1269
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.053
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to know the exact </v>

1270
00:53:08.381 --> 00:53:10.150
<v Speaker 2>questions you're gonna ask me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of that was just like,</v>

1271
00:53:10.151 --> 00:53:10.984
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we gonna talk about what's </v>

1272
00:53:11.351 --> 00:53:12.161
<v Speaker 2>going on and what's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1273
00:53:12.161 --> 00:53:13.510
<v Speaker 2>you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't push me at all.</v>

1274
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that or I'm going to get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1275
00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:17.283
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't do that with our subjects </v>

1276
00:53:18.101 --> 00:53:18.934
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone we're going to go </v>

1277
00:53:19.301 --> 00:53:20.920
<v Speaker 2>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't give them the questions.</v>

1278
00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1279
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.780
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to talk about?</v>

1280
00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:24.460
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about you running </v>
<v Speaker 2>for president.</v>

1281
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.550
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.460
<v Speaker 1>GimMe a Gimme like your worst moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a candidate.</v>

1283
00:53:30.461 --> 00:53:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Like what's like the worst thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

1284
00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Any real flub or did he ever really </v>
<v Speaker 1>offend anybody or anything like that?</v>

1285
00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1286
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.850
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1287
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 2>one of the most contentious moments was </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Rand Paul.</v>

1288
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started this whole thing called no</v>

1289
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:50.760
<v Speaker 2>talking points because I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate,</v>

1290
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I hate talking points and I hate the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians answer questions.</v>

1291
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:55.613
<v Speaker 2>So ask me a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a simple question and I'm going to </v>

1292
00:53:57.031 --> 00:53:58.270
<v Speaker 2>be a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

1293
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your office that you're in right now?</v>

1294
00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about offices,</v>

1295
00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 2>a grandmother taught me was that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really own anything.</v>

1296
00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:10.890
<v Speaker 2>It's all shared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all part of the American people own</v>

1297
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:12.060
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1298
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:13.620
<v Speaker 2>And then you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1299
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 2>are you going to answer the damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>question?</v>

1300
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.930
<v Speaker 2>So the simple answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my office.</v>

1301
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.633
<v Speaker 2>Politicians have a hard time doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Rand Paul had did that with me and I </v>

1302
00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:25.471
<v Speaker 2>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1303
00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:26.304
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you stop telling me what you did </v>

1304
00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:31.530
<v Speaker 2>yesterday in Congress and would you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about this,</v>

1305
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 2>do you hear the question that I'm asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

1306
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:34.403
<v Speaker 2>And so then he got really upset and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>became really heated and so it was an </v>

1307
00:54:37.591 --> 00:54:39.990
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was also a very freeing moment to</v>

1308
00:54:39.991 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 2>me because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1309
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.430
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of this.</v>

1310
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:45.383
<v Speaker 2>And so I set a marker there and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone I had that came on had to </v>

1311
00:54:49.681 --> 00:54:50.514
<v Speaker 2>answer the question and they do now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm not going to badger people </v>

1312
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes they just won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll say okay.</v>

1313
00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And then I will say it is obvious that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to answer the question so</v>

1314
00:54:58.261 --> 00:54:59.570
<v Speaker 2>we will move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1315
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't want to waste the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience time.</v>

1316
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:05.250
<v Speaker 2>So that was probably an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an uncomfortable moment that I have with</v>

1317
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:06.084
<v Speaker 2>a candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I just interviewed him two </v>

1318
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:08.280
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three hours ago.</v>

1319
00:55:08.281 --> 00:55:09.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all good.</v>

1320
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever bite your tongue though,</v>

1321
00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:14.870
<v Speaker 1>related to the fact that you want these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys to come on again?</v>

1322
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Because even when I was in the spin room</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to,</v>

1323
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:20.050
<v Speaker 1>talking to their representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even the candidates,</v>

1324
00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I did feel a little bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1325
00:55:21.541 --> 00:55:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I had huckabee's campaign on back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there at the end,</v>

1326
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.590
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

1327
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:27.930
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they all want to be on CNN.</v>

1328
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All going to come.</v>

1329
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:31.530
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where you're going with this.</v>

1330
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>

1331
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:33.833
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me share a little secret with </v>

1332
00:55:35.281 --> 00:55:36.900
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just between us.</v>

1333
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:37.833
<v Speaker 2>This is just between us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you had that concern you had and </v>

1334
00:55:40.811 --> 00:55:41.644
<v Speaker 2>that's a very real concern and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's real because you do want </v>

1335
00:55:44.671 --> 00:55:46.200
<v Speaker 2>people to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1336
00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's all in the way you asked the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

1337
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:49.554
<v Speaker 2>it's all in the tone and if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you such a damn bleeding heart </v>

1338
00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:55.350
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll go,</v>

1339
00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.290
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can just go,</v>

1340
00:55:58.291 --> 00:55:59.041
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1341
00:55:59.041 --> 00:56:01.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a very liberal perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1342
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Why do you feel that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1343
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 2>it's the same question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1344
00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all in the way you asked it.</v>

1345
00:56:07.771 --> 00:56:09.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like asking a question with a smile</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your face.</v>

1346
00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 2>It's all in the tone and you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>by complimenting.</v>

1347
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like I know you pride yourself on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your politics and your liberalism.</v>

1348
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.940
<v Speaker 2>So would you answer this question for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

1349
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:19.383
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the way you asked the </v>

1350
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:21.880
<v Speaker 2>question</v>

1351
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.713
<v Speaker 1>that sort of brings it back to we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started this sort of online versus </v>

1352
00:56:25.121 --> 00:56:27.460
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media thing because I'll see </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times,</v>

1353
00:56:27.461 --> 00:56:28.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the online guys who aren't interviewing </v>

1354
00:56:30.071 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 1>these people who are commentating on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be like,</v>

1355
00:56:32.171 --> 00:56:33.004
<v Speaker 1>Ahhh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lemon didn't attack him for this or you </v>

1356
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 1>didn't do this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1357
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.813
<v Speaker 1>well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the one that actually has to stand </v>

1358
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:38.561
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it,</v>

1359
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:40.900
<v Speaker 1>get another interview in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1360
00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:41.734
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get truth from people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't going to give you a much </v>

1361
00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:44.680
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1362
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:46.320
<v Speaker 1>so my point is it's easier said than</v>

1363
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.600
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1364
00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:48.493
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not even that it's easier for </v>

1365
00:56:50.001 --> 00:56:50.834
<v Speaker 2>them to say it because there was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily the best way or the easiest </v>

1366
00:56:53.211 --> 00:56:57.830
<v Speaker 2>way because you want someone to continue</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sit there and the interview to answer</v>

1367
00:56:57.831 --> 00:56:59.060
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1368
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

1369
00:57:00.481 --> 00:57:03.890
<v Speaker 2>you also want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to antagonize them.</v>

1370
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:05.083
<v Speaker 2>And I'm also thinking about the viewer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if I continue to antagonize </v>

1371
00:57:08.781 --> 00:57:10.250
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the viewer gets no information.</v>

1372
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.980
<v Speaker 2>That person shuts down and it's not good</v>
<v Speaker 2>for any of us.</v>

1373
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's done.</v>

1374
00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:18.650
<v Speaker 2>So rather than what am I going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up,</v>

1375
00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.980
<v Speaker 2>go over to the chair that the subject </v>
<v Speaker 2>was sitting in and ring their neck.</v>

1376
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna happen.</v>

1377
00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.820
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're sitting there,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what's next?</v>

1398
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:12.783
<v Speaker 1>Because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this thing not to talk about </v>

1399
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:16.180
<v Speaker 1>the rise that you didn't want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about before,</v>

1400
00:58:16.181 --> 00:58:17.230
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen it.</v>

1401
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I flat out seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's next man?</v>

1402
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:23.060
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure you've read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1403
00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.220
<v Speaker 2>so here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always ask me,</v>

1404
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do next?</v>

1405
00:58:28.351 --> 00:58:30.110
<v Speaker 2>What's your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1406
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:30.993
<v Speaker 2>how long bought to get where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just going to love this for </v>

1407
00:58:34.501 --> 00:58:35.970
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really,</v>

1408
00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I wake up every day and usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1409
00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:41.603
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the first time I wake up as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because an alarm goes off and it's time </v>

1410
00:58:44.461 --> 00:58:45.294
<v Speaker 2>for my editorial call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing that's on my mind </v>

1411
00:58:47.851 --> 00:58:48.684
<v Speaker 2>every day as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to put on tv today that </v>

1412
00:58:51.571 --> 00:58:56.430
<v Speaker 2>is pretty freaking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in a really great spot.</v>

1413
00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live every moment in gratitude.</v>

1414
00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I am very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm content.</v>

1415
00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:02.483
<v Speaker 2>I'm not complacent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to enjoy this for the </v>

1416
00:59:04.201 --> 00:59:05.034
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would have to say that the next </v>

1417
00:59:07.111 --> 00:59:08.610
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could think about it,</v>

1418
00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:10.290
<v Speaker 2>but best laid plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1419
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:11.363
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a show that is more bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maher or Chelsea handler or something </v>

1420
00:59:15.901 --> 00:59:19.860
<v Speaker 2>like that where I can actually give a </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view and actually say,</v>

1421
00:59:19.861 --> 00:59:23.390
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit or whatever it is that you said and</v>

1422
00:59:23.391 --> 00:59:25.610
<v Speaker 2>not have everybody going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

1423
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:28.340
<v Speaker 2>she can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe Don Lemon said that.</v>

1424
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:29.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably gonna do that either </v>

1425
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1426
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably.</v>

1427
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 2>If I had to think of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who knows,</v>

1428
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I will probably do this if all goes as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going now,</v>

1429
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 2>knock on wood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1430
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:45.110
<v Speaker 2>God allow for the next 10 or 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not a bad thing.</v>

1431
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1437

<v Speaker 2>I mean it was sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to cut back.</v>
