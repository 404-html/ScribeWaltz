00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jordan Peterson.</v>

2
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Norwegian say knowing further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extroverted enthusiasm.</v>

4
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coming out to that,</v>

5
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

8
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>so here's what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go through some of the big </v>

9
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.481
<v Speaker 1>questions that I've come up with during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last five or six months on the road </v>

10
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you've just been an incredible,</v>

11
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>truly life changing time for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to end with Oslo as</v>
<v Speaker 1>best question.</v>

13
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>You've got 45 minutes and you will see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

14
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>so first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so first off,</v>

15
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>every single night you are different and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think tonight perhaps different,</v>

16
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>more different than any night so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell do you do it?</v>

17
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

18
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually go back in the green room with</v>

19
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>you for a little bit before and about 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

20
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes before showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk out of there and you say you need</v>

21
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>to think for a little bit and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow do an hour and a half summing up</v>

22
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>everything you think in a different way </v>
<v Speaker 1>on any given night.</v>

23
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some Atlanta that technically,</v>

24
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing is,</v>

25
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:48.981
<v Speaker 3>is that something I tell my students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

26
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to write an essay,</v>

27
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 3>you need a problem because the essay is </v>
<v Speaker 3>an attempt to solve a problem.</v>

28
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 3>So first of all you need a problem and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then second,</v>

29
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to devote time to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

30
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 3>then it should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be a problem.</v>

31
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 3>That is your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least a piece of it should be,</v>

32
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have students all the time and they </v>

33
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.601
<v Speaker 3>come up to me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me what I should write my essay </v>

34
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.811
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're often very annoyed that I </v>

35
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:17.811
<v Speaker 3>haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

36
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:17.811
<v Speaker 3>you didn't give us a topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

37
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's because the topic is the </v>

38
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 3>difficult part of the assignment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

39
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:29.301
<v Speaker 3>To specify the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the difficult part of the </v>

40
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:29.301
<v Speaker 3>assignment.</v>

41
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're trying to,</v>

42
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 3>when you're trying to address a complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say domain of suffering,</v>

43
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 3>the diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the problem formulation is the </v>

44
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 3>crucial cognitive step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to write,</v>

45
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Speaker 3>you need a problem and and if you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to write truthfully then you need a </v>

46
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.221
<v Speaker 3>problem that's yours and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write in a focused and aimed manner then</v>

47
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 3>you unite your thinking around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

48
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 3>And so one thing I always do before when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sit backstage is I think,</v>

49
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the problem for tonight?</v>

50
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the problem for tonight was victim.</v>

51
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 3>So it's one statements like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

52
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:16.351
<v Speaker 3>let's explore the concept of victim and </v>
<v Speaker 3>go down as far as we possibly can.</v>

53
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>

54
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.530
<v Speaker 3>well then I would say my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have my knowledge organized in a </v>

55
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.810
<v Speaker 3>idiosyncratic manner and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of having spent.</v>

56
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 3>When I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote my first book,</v>

57
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:38.911
<v Speaker 3>which was maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote every day for three hours for 15</v>

58
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:46.111
<v Speaker 3>years and I vowed when I started that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to make that.</v>

59
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 3>What would you say that the highest duty</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had,</v>

60
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.840
<v Speaker 3>nothing was going to come before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a certain amount of cruelty </v>

61
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 3>in that because it meant that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

62
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:04.651
<v Speaker 3>if my wife came into my office than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would bark at her and if my kids came </v>

63
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 3>into my office like a junkyard dogs </v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by barbed wire,</v>

64
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 3>it's like because you can always not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

65
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.140
<v Speaker 3>It's not that important that day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be more pressing concerns </v>

66
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 3>and they're probably including people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who would just like to have something to</v>

67
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.330
<v Speaker 3>do with you for awhile or do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicer,</v>

68
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 3>have a problem fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

69
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go away.</v>

70
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I've got three hours.</v>

71
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 3>And so I see I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

72
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a thief and I took that from my </v>

73
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.791
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I spent a very long time writing </v>

74
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 3>and thinking about the hardest problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I could conceptualize.</v>

75
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:47.221
<v Speaker 3>And that was the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual and the atrocity </v>

76
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 3>committed in the service of totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 3>possession.</v>

77
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 3>It was the worst problem I could think </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

78
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look to see what the worst thing </v>

79
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.650
<v Speaker 3>people could do under the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances was and tried to figure </v>

80
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.121
<v Speaker 3>out why that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was step one and step two was </v>

81
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 3>having come to some determination about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how it might happen then and having </v>

82
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 3>learned something that I had suspected </v>
<v Speaker 3>all along,</v>

83
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:24.061
<v Speaker 3>which was that that capacity was part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual,</v>

84
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me as well as everyone else to determine</v>

85
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:34.351
<v Speaker 3>if there was a mode of acting in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world that would restrict that </v>

86
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:38.821
<v Speaker 3>possibility so that it would no longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifests itself and so I spent however </v>

87
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 3>many hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$45,000</v>

88
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:48.661
<v Speaker 3>thinking about that and that's not right</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's how much time I spent </v>

89
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:53.161
<v Speaker 3>writing about it most of that time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I have a very obsessive mind in </v>

90
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 3>some sense our lock on a problem.</v>

91
00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.330
<v Speaker 3>I can't let it go or can't let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know which way to think about </v>

92
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 3>it and so it wasn't only that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing for three hours a day.</v>

93
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.981
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right from the time I woke up until the </v>

94
00:06:08.981 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 3>time I went to sleep and I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it obsessively.</v>

95
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read a tremendous amount when I was in</v>

96
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.480
<v Speaker 3>graduate school and so the reason I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling you all of that is to answer </v>

97
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.951
<v Speaker 3>this question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I spent 30 years lecturing </v>

98
00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:26.381
<v Speaker 3>about it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started out with my lectures fairly </v>

99
00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 3>structured because I was still wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the ideas,</v>

100
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:32.141
<v Speaker 3>but I tried over the years to reduce the</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of scaffolding safety wire </v>

101
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.030
<v Speaker 3>netting that was underneath me while I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was lecturing until I got to the point </v>

102
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 3>where I didn't need to do anything other</v>
<v Speaker 3>than sit for 10 minutes and think,</v>

103
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the problem?</v>

104
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Where am I going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm exploring a solution.</v>

105
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:52.871
<v Speaker 3>I'm not necessarily putting forward a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pre constructed solution like it'll be </v>

106
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 3>in the universe of solutions I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered,</v>

107
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 3>but I'd like to get it sharper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearer.</v>

108
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.190
<v Speaker 3>So I got to the point where I could go </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the problem through the story using</v>

109
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:08.291
<v Speaker 3>all these things that I had already </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about a new and so then I can </v>

110
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:12.311
<v Speaker 3>sequence them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the closest analogy I can </v>

111
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 3>think of is jazz improvisation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

112
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:18.941
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an expert musician has a tremendous </v>

113
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:19.300
<v Speaker 3>number of hubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>habits,</v>

114
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 3>deeply ingrained like an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing that,</v>

115
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.670
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are part and parcel built into to,</v>

116
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.950
<v Speaker 3>to him or her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I have that and so then I can </v>

117
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.950
<v Speaker 3>come out and think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

118
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 3>well a little of this and little of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

119
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:39.011
<v Speaker 3>and that's new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like each of these ideas is a </v>

120
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:42.941
<v Speaker 3>personality of sorts and you can let </v>
<v Speaker 3>them have a dialogue in real time and </v>

121
00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 3>see where it goes.</v>

122
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 3>And that's the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

123
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 3>That's what a great author does when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>writes a book,</v>

124
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:51.881
<v Speaker 3>as he puts out some characters and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he lets the characters do whatever they </v>

125
00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 3>would do and that reveals the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I kind of do that.</v>

126
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:59.831
<v Speaker 3>I let the ideas do what they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do and see how they fight and compete </v>

127
00:07:59.831 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 3>with one another and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

128
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 3>and then that's see what people wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lectures,</v>

129
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 3>assuming that this is a lecture and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably isn't,</v>

130
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 3>it's probably more like a strange sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of dialogue with the audience.</v>

131
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.400
<v Speaker 3>What people want in a forum like this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to see thought inaction,</v>

132
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to see something that's </v>

133
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 3>already crystallized and and dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I did read the last time I </v>

134
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 3>was here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I do that rarely,</v>

135
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 3>they want to see something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to see what they want to see.</v>

136
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Technically speaking is something if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought about metaphysically as they </v>

137
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 3>want to see the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inaction.</v>

138
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.510
<v Speaker 3>That's really what people always want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see and I mean that philosophically and </v>

139
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:52.301
<v Speaker 3>so the real time part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it's not a contrived </v>

140
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:58.270
<v Speaker 3>performances out actually crucial to its</v>
<v Speaker 3>success and also what keeps me engaged.</v>

141
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how these damn lectures are</v>

142
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 3>going to go when I come out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

143
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>victim,</v>

144
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big problem.</v>

145
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we could,</v>

146
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.810
<v Speaker 3>we could address it with this and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>we could use this and I can play those </v>

147
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.611
<v Speaker 3>together and we can see how that goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then perhaps I'll be able to draw a </v>

148
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 3>rousing conclusion because it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring that to the point at the end,</v>

149
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:25.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>successfully to something I've got </v>

150
00:09:25.971 --> 00:09:25.971
<v Speaker 3>better at over the tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite fun,</v>

151
00:09:25.971 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 3>but I never don't know if it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

152
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm on edge when I come out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage,</v>

153
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

154
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:38.271
<v Speaker 3>I've got a big problem here and I've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sorted out in 70 minutes and there's </v>

155
00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:38.271
<v Speaker 3>all these people here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

156
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

157
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that makes it really tense for me in</v>

158
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.120
<v Speaker 3>an exciting way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an exhilarating,</v>

159
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an exhilarating challenge,</v>

160
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:52.281
<v Speaker 3>but that also makes it alive because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could easily fail so.</v>

161
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how it's lots of practice.</v>

162
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.840
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the final thing is I don't talk</v>

163
00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:03.140
<v Speaker 3>about problems that don't matter to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they matter,</v>

164
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.820
<v Speaker 3>this victim thing that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's important fundamental.</v>

165
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.530
<v Speaker 3>And so every night I come out and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

166
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:14.531
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what's the fundamental problem for </v>

167
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.721
<v Speaker 3>tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a problem that affects me as </v>

168
00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:18.340
<v Speaker 3>far as deep down as much as I can go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

169
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.630
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah.</v>

170
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the point in life when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>became a serious person?</v>

171
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that in the best sense of it </v>

172
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 1>because when people asked me what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be on tour with you,</v>

173
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

174
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:38.170
<v Speaker 1>he takes life seriously and it's making </v>
<v Speaker 1>me take life more seriously.</v>

175
00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's making these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>take life more seriously.</v>

176
00:10:41.261 --> 00:10:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the moment that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

177
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell me that moment?</v>

178
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

179
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was in I think 19,</v>

180
00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:57.011
<v Speaker 3>83.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a strange story.</v>

181
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came home from a party,</v>

182
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.760
<v Speaker 3>a university party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wasn't in the best mood.</v>

183
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.240
<v Speaker 3>I've always had a certain proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards depression,</v>

184
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:16.241
<v Speaker 3>which I've recently discovered is </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably an autoimmune problem in any </v>

185
00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:17.830
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

186
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I'd gone to this party and I'd had a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>to drink because I like to drink.</v>

187
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.210
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

188
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't happy with something that </v>

189
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 3>happened at the party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't happy with the way I behave.</v>

190
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not uncommon,</v>

191
00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:32.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

192
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.190
<v Speaker 3>if like to drink then you're not happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the way he behaved.</v>

193
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:37.510
<v Speaker 3>Those things just go together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

194
00:11:37.511 --> 00:11:39.280
<v Speaker 3>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was deeper than that.</v>

195
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.190
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just that I was unhappy with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the party had gone,</v>

196
00:11:42.191 --> 00:11:46.300
<v Speaker 3>but I was deeply dissatisfied with how I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was oriented in life.</v>

197
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt that I felt that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

198
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.400
<v Speaker 3>it was a nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose that was,</v>

199
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.420
<v Speaker 3>that was gnawing at me and this was not </v>
<v Speaker 3>long after I'd stopped.</v>

200
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I'd worked for Socialist Party in Canada</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a while when I was a kid.</v>

201
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 3>And this wasn't long after I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

202
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 3>And so I kind of lost my moorings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

203
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Christianity that my mother </v>

204
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 3>practiced in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had abandon that when I was like 13.</v>

205
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.120
<v Speaker 3>And so I didn't have any structured </v>
<v Speaker 3>orient me at all.</v>

206
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.180
<v Speaker 3>And so I was experimenting a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>with artistic production at this point.</v>

207
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a bit.</v>

208
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:30.871
<v Speaker 3>And so I took out this canvas from my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my closet and I sat down and I sketched </v>

209
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:37.420
<v Speaker 3>out this picture and I just let my </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination roam.</v>

210
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.500
<v Speaker 3>And what came out was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a crucifixion and there was a,</v>

211
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I drew a picture of Christ on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the crucifixion,</v>

212
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 3>but with a very judgemental face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very angry face,</v>

213
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 3>and with a snake wrapped around his </v>
<v Speaker 3>waist.</v>

214
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.290
<v Speaker 3>And it was really harsh picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like an expressionist picture.</v>

215
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 3>And not that I have the talent of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressionist,</v>

216
00:12:57.461 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

217
00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

218
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

219
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.450
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think that I was thinking in </v>

220
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 3>religious terms at that point at all.</v>

221
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:12.390
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was an absolutely sporadic church </v>

222
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:12.390
<v Speaker 3>goer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

223
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.260
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was absolutely shocked by this </v>

224
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:16.260
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

225
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:16.260
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

226
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.980
<v Speaker 3>where the hell did this come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did that possibly me,</v>

227
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

228
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 3>it took me years to figure out what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>meant.</v>

229
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good one,</v>

230
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.660
<v Speaker 3>one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll tell you part of what it meant.</v>

231
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:34.050
<v Speaker 3>So Carl Jung said something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about the structure of the </v>

232
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 3>New Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that the Gospel,</v>

233
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:40.861
<v Speaker 3>Christ is fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although not entirely fundamentally a </v>

234
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:45.091
<v Speaker 3>figure of compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ideal is not only compassion,</v>

235
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 3>the ideal is also a judge because an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal is a judge.</v>

236
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you have an ideal law,</v>

237
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 3>it's a judge because you don't live up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>

238
00:13:56.531 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 3>and so your ideal is always looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>you like you're not what you should be.</v>

239
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:03.610
<v Speaker 3>And the higher the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more judgmental the judge.</v>

240
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why he thought the book of </v>

241
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 3>revelation first of all emerged in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an unconscious revelation,</v>

242
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.820
<v Speaker 3>which because Christ comes back at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of time,</v>

243
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.880
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the story goes as the ultimate judge </v>

244
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 3>and virtually no one is judged </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptable while why?</v>

245
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because by the highest possible see </v>

246
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.760
<v Speaker 3>speaking psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can biologically for that matter,</v>

247
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 3>the idea of Christ is the instantiation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ideal.</v>

248
00:14:34.111 --> 00:14:36.660
<v Speaker 3>As such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

249
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.340
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be more than that,</v>

250
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.380
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

251
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 3>it's whatever a human being would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a human being was perfect and it's an</v>

252
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.350
<v Speaker 3>effort of our collective imagination to </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent that symbolically,</v>

253
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:51.180
<v Speaker 3>which we do with cathedrals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

254
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 3>we paint the image of Christ against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dome that represents eternity itself.</v>

255
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might say,</v>

256
00:14:57.621 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in the ideal.</v>

257
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:02.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're missing the point.</v>

258
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.350
<v Speaker 3>You're missing the point and so so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal is a judge and the farther you are</v>

259
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 3>away from that ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the harsher the judge,</v>

260
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:16.450
<v Speaker 3>and so the snake was part of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the thing is is that if you're </v>

261
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:20.300
<v Speaker 3>low enough and the ideal is high enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideal itself is so judgmental and so</v>

262
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:23.270
<v Speaker 3>detached for you that it starts to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you like your enemy.</v>

263
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 3>And so that was the painting and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

264
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.020
<v Speaker 3>and I was asking a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing that I was asking the</v>

265
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:35.021
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was asking like what would I have to </v>

266
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:37.721
<v Speaker 3>do to set this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would I have to do to set the </v>

267
00:15:37.721 --> 00:15:38.180
<v Speaker 3>situation that I'm in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

268
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.430
<v Speaker 3>And so then I drew this picture and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>

269
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:44.840
<v Speaker 3>How had the had the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

270
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 3>artistic production always has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

271
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:49.160
<v Speaker 3>That's where the answers come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

272
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 3>and so that was a manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>

273
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.620
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was part of me attempting in its </v>

274
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 3>symbolic mode of personified thinking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>deliver a message.</v>

275
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.410
<v Speaker 3>And so I swore that night that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do whatever it took to set </v>

276
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

277
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

278
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.590
<v Speaker 3>And I was dead serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that was the,</v>

279
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:17.890
<v Speaker 3>that was the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I don't know what I did with </v>

280
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:17.890
<v Speaker 3>that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

281
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I hid it in my closet because I was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>freaked out by it.</v>

282
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the Hell is this?</v>

283
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:25.571
<v Speaker 3>It's like some schizophrenia nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like underneath the covers with </v>

284
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 3>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was the,</v>

285
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.150
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

286
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.160
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't long after that that I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first essay that eventually turned </v>

287
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 3>into this maps of meaning book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a poem to begin with actually,</v>

288
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:40.871
<v Speaker 3>that that was how it came about first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's when I decided to be,</v>

289
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.840
<v Speaker 3>to straighten myself out regardless of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to straighten myself out.</v>

290
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.250
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

291
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.340
<v Speaker 1>so I think this is our 13th show in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

292
00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:59.341
<v Speaker 1>We've got a couple more over the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days and now it sounds like </v>

293
00:16:59.341 --> 00:16:59.470
<v Speaker 1>we're extending for another 30 or 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably in the spring.</v>

294
00:16:59.471 --> 00:17:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean this thing has just grown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown and grown a.</v>

295
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.420
<v Speaker 1>are you shocked at the amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that live in western societies here in </v>

296
00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:14.701
<v Speaker 1>Norway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when we were in Sweden a </v>

297
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:14.701
<v Speaker 1>couple of days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the countries that we've been in</v>

298
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.910
<v Speaker 1>that live in free societies yet art </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely afraid to say what they think</v>

299
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.120
<v Speaker 1>is absolutely shocking.</v>

300
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the most.</v>

301
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 3>I think what I've been most shocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about in all of that is what's happened </v>

302
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.751
<v Speaker 3>in the UK with the police starting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecute people for crimes of </v>

303
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.390
<v Speaker 3>offensiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just.</v>

304
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.520
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's probably partly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm an.</v>

305
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that as broadly reflective of,</v>

306
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.840
<v Speaker 3>of something that's happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>West in general,</v>

307
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's particularly shocking and </v>
<v Speaker 3>appalling to me as a,</v>

308
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:53.230
<v Speaker 3>as a western know because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>counted that was part of the British </v>

309
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:57.891
<v Speaker 3>empire and when I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was a pretty tight affinity </v>

310
00:17:57.891 --> 00:17:59.430
<v Speaker 3>still in western Canada with the British</v>
<v Speaker 3>empire.</v>

311
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:04.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our maps where the dominion of Canada </v>

312
00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:04.431
<v Speaker 3>was still pink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

313
00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 3>it was still part of the British empire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We Sang God save the Queen Constantly at</v>

314
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.710
<v Speaker 3>public gatherings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gone by the wayside.</v>

315
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.980
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

316
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.210
<v Speaker 3>I've always regarded British common law </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the British parliamentary tradition </v>

317
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:25.521
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of it perhaps the highest </v>

318
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 3>achievement of western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

319
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.180
<v Speaker 3>you could argue about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

320
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 3>it's in the top 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

321
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:35.460
<v Speaker 3>And then to see the Brits who also have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this phenomenal sense of humor,</v>

322
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:40.461
<v Speaker 3>this ability to say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how outrageous about anyone </v>

323
00:18:40.461 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 3>and to include themselves in the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

324
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:47.841
<v Speaker 3>Which is such an elegant way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressing comedic freedom to see them </v>

325
00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:52.080
<v Speaker 3>going down this road is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

326
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

327
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:57.900
<v Speaker 3>it's what is it exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it's deeply saddening,</v>

328
00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.730
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

329
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:00.890
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

330
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 3>what's horrifying and it's not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right word.</v>

331
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the word for it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there certainly sorrow that's associated</v>

332
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:09.770
<v Speaker 3>with a disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also</v>

333
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.510
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

334
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:17.290
<v Speaker 3>at watching that happen in what I still </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is the central core of the idea of</v>

335
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.910
<v Speaker 3>individual sovereignty and freedom as </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressed across the western world.</v>

336
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.360
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's similar manifestations </v>

337
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.691
<v Speaker 3>of that everywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the police per prosecuting people </v>

338
00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:34.220
<v Speaker 3>for you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking people to turn in their neighbors</v>

339
00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:37.970
<v Speaker 3>if they say something offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's happening in the UK.</v>

340
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally what we saw that,</v>

341
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.500
<v Speaker 3>that somebody sent me posters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures of posters in the Scottish </v>

342
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.450
<v Speaker 3>subway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the metro,</v>

343
00:19:47.451 --> 00:19:48.710
<v Speaker 3>in the tube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

344
00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:53.711
<v Speaker 3>saying inviting people to inform on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their neighbors for being offensive.</v>

345
00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:56.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

346
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:58.130
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I knew this was coming because.</v>

347
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Because I knew we brought our first hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech laws in Canada back in the 19 </v>

348
00:20:06.141 --> 00:20:09.110
<v Speaker 3>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were after this character named Ernst</v>

349
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Zandel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is a particularly despicable piece </v>

350
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.080
<v Speaker 3>of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard hat wearing right wing antisemitism</v>

351
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Holocaust denier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

352
00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:19.510
<v Speaker 3>he had it all that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

353
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:25.060
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was his shenanigans,</v>

354
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.380
<v Speaker 3>careless malevolent shenanigans that </v>
<v Speaker 3>entice Canadians into producing hate </v>

355
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:34.340
<v Speaker 3>speech legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

356
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

357
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.450
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

358
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.390
<v Speaker 3>You're making a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to pay for this.</v>

359
00:20:41.391 --> 00:20:43.160
<v Speaker 3>It's going to unfold over a long time.</v>

360
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Who defines hate</v>

361
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:48.350
<v Speaker 2>the crucial</v>

362
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.870
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it's a scientific category</v>

363
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.320
<v Speaker 3>to judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is those whom you least </v>

364
00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.791
<v Speaker 3>want to have the power to define it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're the ones that will take </v>

365
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:02.480
<v Speaker 3>that power to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you think that isn't gonna Affect</v>

366
00:21:02.481 --> 00:21:05.210
<v Speaker 3>what you get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you've got another thing coming.</v>

367
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.680
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to pay for it and </v>

368
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.630
<v Speaker 3>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully we'll wake up and push back </v>

369
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.650
<v Speaker 3>before we have to pay too high a price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to pay for it.</v>

370
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to deserve to pay for it</v>

371
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's talking to you</v>

372
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 4>last night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last night</v>

373
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.510
<v Speaker 3>it was on this British show called </v>
<v Speaker 3>question time,</v>

374
00:21:41.511 --> 00:21:44.300
<v Speaker 3>which is very famous British show and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

375
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman parliamentarian.</v>

376
00:21:46.611 --> 00:21:48.470
<v Speaker 3>They're from Ireland who was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>bright.</v>

377
00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 3>I liked listening to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm the host asked me about this </v>

378
00:21:54.411 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 3>character named count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dang,</v>

379
00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Kyla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know about him.</v>

380
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a comedian.</v>

381
00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks he's a comedian and.</v>

382
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

383
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 3>there are lots of Comedians who think </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're comedians that aren't funny and </v>

384
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying he's not funny because </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people think that he's a comedian </v>

385
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.140
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he presents himself as a comedian.</v>

386
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Count Danky law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's actually a joke,</v>

387
00:22:18.531 --> 00:22:23.531
<v Speaker 3>that name and his girlfriend had a pug </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I liked count danky him because he </v>

388
00:22:24.501 --> 00:22:28.130
<v Speaker 3>hated that pug and I'm not very fond of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pugs.</v>

389
00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:30.710
<v Speaker 3>I think they're hideous little creatures</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

390
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:31.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

391
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:37.610
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really hate them if a bug comes </v>

392
00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:37.860
<v Speaker 3>along then all pet it and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

393
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.710
<v Speaker 5>it's just sort of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

394
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.350
<v Speaker 5>this little rat like dog with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>bugs.</v>

395
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.890
<v Speaker 5>If you hit it on the back of the head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the eyes will pop out and so because </v>

396
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:52.120
<v Speaker 5>they've been so genetically mishandled </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so,</v>

397
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

398
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:58.381
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do realize we're putting this on </v>

399
00:22:58.381 --> 00:23:00.781
<v Speaker 5>youtube and you're just done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're unleashing a whole new world to </v>

400
00:23:00.781 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 5>hate to bug people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

401
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.410
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

402
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 5>but whatever,</v>

403
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.770
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can have your plugin,</v>

404
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.780
<v Speaker 3>you can love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad had this dog that was so damn </v>

405
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.440
<v Speaker 3>hideous and useless that it was just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>miracle and he loved it to death and so,</v>

406
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

407
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.690
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

408
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:19.150
<v Speaker 3>And there's kind of an ironic attitude </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the dismissal of pugs and Daniella </v>

409
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.910
<v Speaker 3>didn't like his girlfriend's pug and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought he'd play a mean trick or a </v>

410
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 3>mean slash funny trick and teach it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do a hail Hitler salute.</v>

411
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 5>I actually thought it was quite funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I don't,</v>

412
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.850
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see that as glorifying Hitler </v>

413
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.030
<v Speaker 5>hits up Pug for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't,</v>

414
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:38.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't a,</v>

415
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 5>what do you call those Doberman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

416
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:46.290
<v Speaker 5>it was a pub.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like teaching a rat to do a hail </v>

417
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.501
<v Speaker 5>Hitler salute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that this has come down to the </v>

418
00:23:50.501 --> 00:23:52.100
<v Speaker 5>breed of dogs with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These things matter in terms of,</v>

419
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.470
<v Speaker 3>I love the way they're represented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

420
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

421
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.370
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he taught it to,</v>

422
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.480
<v Speaker 3>it's so horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and I'm gonna be so killed for this.</v>

423
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 3>He taught it to do it's little salute </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he said gas the Jews,</v>

424
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:09.370
<v Speaker 3>which is not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

425
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.630
<v Speaker 3>except it's horribly funny,</v>

426
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing.</v>

427
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.280
<v Speaker 5>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so yeah,</v>

428
00:24:14.281 --> 00:24:15.510
<v Speaker 5>you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

429
00:24:15.511 --> 00:24:17.430
<v Speaker 5>Because you're all horrible and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

430
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 5>and you know perfectly well that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>horribly funny and you know,</v>

431
00:24:29.011 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 5>we need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need</v>

432
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:34.440
<v Speaker 3>to be able to be horribly funny because </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is horrible and we.</v>

433
00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:39.441
<v Speaker 3>And we need to be able to find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to be able to allow people the </v>

434
00:24:39.661 --> 00:24:44.661
<v Speaker 3>freedom to find the ability to transcend</v>
<v Speaker 3>that horror with comedy and a mark of a </v>

435
00:24:46.141 --> 00:24:50.940
<v Speaker 3>free society is that con comedians can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be just exactly what the R is,</v>

436
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.970
<v Speaker 3>which there are people who push the edge</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what's acceptable.</v>

437
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.970
<v Speaker 3>If you're a brilliant comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get right to the edge,</v>

438
00:24:56.971 --> 00:24:58.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>New dance there.</v>

439
00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.560
<v Speaker 3>And the audience is thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Silvermans a good example of that.</v>

440
00:25:01.561 --> 00:25:02.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can just see her.</v>

441
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.830
<v Speaker 3>She's gone all politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>

442
00:25:04.831 --> 00:25:07.290
<v Speaker 3>but when she was in her heyday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could just see Sarah,</v>

443
00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:09.720
<v Speaker 3>she's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd see you're sitting there and she'd</v>

444
00:25:09.721 --> 00:25:14.160
<v Speaker 3>think of something just spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil and horrible.</v>

445
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.560
<v Speaker 3>And she think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

446
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.210
<v Speaker 3>and then she say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

447
00:25:18.211 --> 00:25:23.211
<v Speaker 3>and everyone would just crack up because</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the darkest part of their soul had </v>

448
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:25.650
<v Speaker 3>once thought something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she dared to Audi read 10.</v>

449
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.950
<v Speaker 3>And by honoring it she also </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously transcended it,</v>

450
00:25:28.951 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the beauty of comedy and,</v>

451
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.090
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and well.</v>

452
00:25:33.091 --> 00:25:33.890
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

453
00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:36.510
<v Speaker 3>they went after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dang Kyla and nailed him legally.</v>

454
00:25:36.511 --> 00:25:39.110
<v Speaker 3>And I thought that's an that's in Great </v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain as well.</v>

455
00:25:39.111 --> 00:25:44.111
<v Speaker 3>And last night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they brought this up one on question </v>

456
00:25:44.111 --> 00:25:47.661
<v Speaker 3>time and you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Irish woman who said she went off on</v>

457
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.480
<v Speaker 3>a talk about how terrible Kristallnacht </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't,</v>

458
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.960
<v Speaker 3>what an awful thing Auschwitz and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Holocaust was.</v>

459
00:25:54.961 --> 00:25:56.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

460
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.350
<v Speaker 3>you're not that morally virtuous to </v>
<v Speaker 3>notice that know.</v>

461
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.480
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like.</v>

462
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.000
<v Speaker 3>And it didn't have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the topic at hand.</v>

463
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:17.001
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet you wouldn't say that you noticed </v>

464
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:19.911
<v Speaker 3>that unless you were implying that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are people around you including this </v>

465
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:19.911
<v Speaker 3>count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dang,</v>

466
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:21.600
<v Speaker 3>can I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who didn't notice that?</v>

467
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had nothing to do with whether he </v>

468
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 3>should have been prosecuted for his </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid joke.</v>

469
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.040
<v Speaker 3>And then you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

470
00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:31.470
<v Speaker 3>you could say it was a stupid joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it certainly was.</v>

471
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.080
<v Speaker 3>You could say that it was a hateful </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke,</v>

472
00:26:34.081 --> 00:26:36.840
<v Speaker 3>which I don't agree with by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you could say that.</v>

473
00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:39.990
<v Speaker 3>And I think you could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could make a credible case for that.</v>

474
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 3>But then to say that because you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Holocaust bad,</v>

475
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.110
<v Speaker 3>he should be criminally prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

476
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry man,</v>

477
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 3>you've crossed the line and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse for it.</v>

478
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.300
<v Speaker 3>And so that's part of what's worrisome </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the state of discourse in the free</v>

479
00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:00.150
<v Speaker 3>West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That same thing,</v>

480
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 3>comedians won't go to university </v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses,</v>

481
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to be funny.</v>

482
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.310
<v Speaker 3>So if you can't be funny than you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>free,</v>

483
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 3>you know the gesture and the king's </v>
<v Speaker 3>courts,</v>

484
00:27:11.731 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 3>the only person who gets to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

485
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 3>And if the king is such a tyrant that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>kills his gesture,</v>

486
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 3>then you know that the evil king is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge.</v>

487
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 3>And so when we can't tolerate our </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians,</v>

488
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

489
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:24.240
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the canaries in the coal mine as</v>

490
00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:25.140
<v Speaker 3>far as I'm concerned.</v>

491
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

492
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:45.110
<v Speaker 3>My wife that I wouldn't hit any hornets </v>
<v Speaker 3>with any Hornet's nest with sticks for </v>

493
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:50.601
<v Speaker 3>like a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now I just hit a big hornet's nest </v>

494
00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:50.601
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>

495
00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:52.290
<v Speaker 1>So sorry Tammy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's here somewhere.</v>

496
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it up for Jordan's wife,</v>

497
00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's been on this entire time.</v>

498
00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

499
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.490
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's at David's fault.</v>

500
00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

501
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.800
<v Speaker 1>let's shift gears a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has been the best part</v>

502
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.200
<v Speaker 3>of this adventure of this tour for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally?</v>

503
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

504
00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:25.060
<v Speaker 3>the best part happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best part I think.</v>

505
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.730
<v Speaker 3>I think I told this story tonight </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

506
00:28:28.731 --> 00:28:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure because I talked to a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of journalists today,</v>

507
00:28:30.901 --> 00:28:32.360
<v Speaker 3>so can't remember when I told this </v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

508
00:28:32.361 --> 00:28:36.590
<v Speaker 3>but this guy came up to me last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was kind of a pierced guy,</v>

509
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.850
<v Speaker 3>rough looking guy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's probably in his late twenties,</v>

510
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.090
<v Speaker 3>maybe early thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

511
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

512
00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

513
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I've been smoking drug free for nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

514
00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.620
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

515
00:28:50.621 --> 00:28:55.621
<v Speaker 3>good work man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he looked pretty pleased about </v>

516
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:55.621
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

517
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:55.621
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

518
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:58.180
<v Speaker 3>hopefully that's a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said it's a lot better.</v>

519
00:28:58.690 --> 00:28:59.230
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

520
00:28:59.231 --> 00:29:01.750
<v Speaker 3>good for you for sticking it out and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hope you can continue it.</v>

521
00:29:01.751 --> 00:29:06.751
<v Speaker 3>And I meant that because I didn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>good for you and hope you can stick it </v>

522
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:10.231
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he knew I meant that because he </v>

523
00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:10.231
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have bloody well told me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to begin with,</v>

524
00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:11.260
<v Speaker 3>he didn't think that that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be the response.</v>

525
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 3>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got nine of my mates to do the same </v>

526
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

527
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.040
<v Speaker 3>I thought right on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

528
00:29:18.041 --> 00:29:19.560
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

529
00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:21.910
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Birmingham two nights ago and I</v>

530
00:29:21.911 --> 00:29:25.720
<v Speaker 3>walked out of the hotel and this kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>working class kid came up to me,</v>

531
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just out of the blue.</v>

532
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much for elevating my </v>

533
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

534
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.731
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really good thing to be able to go </v>

535
00:29:35.731 --> 00:29:38.551
<v Speaker 3>around the world and to have people stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>you on the street and say things like </v>

536
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:38.860
<v Speaker 3>that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's as good as it gets.</v>

537
00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:43.861
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people are telling me stories like </v>

538
00:29:43.861 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 3>all the time they come up and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you've watched this thing.</v>

539
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:49.170
<v Speaker 3>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People come up and they tell me some way</v>

540
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 3>that their house was out of order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

541
00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:56.221
<v Speaker 3>they are hopeless and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nihilistic and drinking too much and</v>

542
00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:01.590
<v Speaker 3>watching too much pornography and </v>
<v Speaker 3>procrastinating too much and being not </v>

543
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.440
<v Speaker 3>serious with the relationship and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting along with their parents and you</v>

544
00:30:04.441 --> 00:30:06.730
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not formulating a vision and not growing</v>

545
00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:08.090
<v Speaker 3>up and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

546
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 3>there's just endless ways that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>descend into a kind of,</v>

547
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.190
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kind of Grungy,</v>

548
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:21.270
<v Speaker 3>filthy carpet infested hell and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

549
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.470
<v Speaker 3>and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

550
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:28.471
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching your lectures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've developed a plan for my life and </v>

551
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.600
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to be more responsible </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've been really turned to tell the </v>

552
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:33.600
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

553
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.290
<v Speaker 3>And I mended my relationship with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>father and I got married to my </v>

554
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.951
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend and now I have a flat and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>quit doing drugs and I've just tripled </v>

555
00:30:40.951 --> 00:30:43.000
<v Speaker 3>my salary in the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

556
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't commit suicide like I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to six months ago.</v>

557
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:49.150
<v Speaker 3>I think I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

558
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 3>out of 150 people that I talked to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

559
00:30:52.091 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 3>I would say probably over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lecture series,</v>

560
00:30:55.991 --> 00:31:00.991
<v Speaker 3>there's probably 10 people like that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>night who tell me that and so see,</v>

561
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.240
<v Speaker 3>because I believe what I said tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that the individual is </v>

562
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.891
<v Speaker 3>sovereign and that individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>sovereignty is the cornerstone of </v>

563
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 3>reality itself and it's the cornerstone </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the state and it's the cornerstone of</v>

564
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 3>reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I truly believe that to be the case,</v>

565
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.360
<v Speaker 3>that every time I hear someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

566
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 3>I've got my act together.</v>

567
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:28.560
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one more weight on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

568
00:31:28.561 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 3>if the scales are always tilting towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>good or towards evil,</v>

569
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 3>then every time someone decides to </v>
<v Speaker 3>straighten themselves up,</v>

570
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:39.871
<v Speaker 3>they put a mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take a major weight off the evil </v>

571
00:31:39.871 --> 00:31:42.751
<v Speaker 3>side and they put it on the good side </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not trivial and I believe that </v>

572
00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 3>that's what the redemption of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>depends on.</v>

573
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens at the level of the </v>

574
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.081
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like the descent into totalitarian </v>

575
00:31:52.081 --> 00:31:54.370
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe occurs when people abandon </v>
<v Speaker 3>their sovereign responsibility,</v>

576
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:59.460
<v Speaker 3>which I think is the most accurate way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of diagnosing what happened in the 20th </v>

577
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.121
<v Speaker 3>century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whenever someone comes up to me and </v>

578
00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:03.121
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was not doing so well,</v>

579
00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:06.430
<v Speaker 3>and here's three ways where I've really </v>
<v Speaker 3>put my life together,</v>

580
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.270
<v Speaker 3>we have a little 15 second party and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>both know why,</v>

581
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 3>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's as good as it gets.</v>

582
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:18.390
<v Speaker 3>And so that's happening constantly and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel generally speaking that these </v>

583
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 3>events are like their celebrations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and so interesting to watch.</v>

584
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:26.701
<v Speaker 3>The media missed this completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they don't have the </v>

585
00:32:26.701 --> 00:32:29.170
<v Speaker 3>conceptual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you say?</v>

586
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:35.210
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the conceptual tools to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that something might be </v>

587
00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:41.521
<v Speaker 3>happening that's worthy of note outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>the purely conventional confines of,</v>

588
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.750
<v Speaker 3>of you know that the stultifying and dol</v>
<v Speaker 3>political discourse,</v>

589
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.470
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be nice if it didn't happen.</v>

590
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fundamentally mattered </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a psychologist.</v>

591
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.120
<v Speaker 3>I decided a long time ago that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual was the right level of </v>

592
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 3>analysis and so it's an absolute.</v>

593
00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.670
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a pleasure.</v>

594
00:33:06.671 --> 00:33:08.350
<v Speaker 3>It's not the right way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

595
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.450
<v Speaker 3>What's rule seven?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>

596
00:33:13.451 --> 00:33:15.310
<v Speaker 3>What is meaningful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Note what is expedient.</v>

597
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:20.200
<v Speaker 3>This is the most deeply meaningful thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I can envision doing.</v>

598
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.320
<v Speaker 3>So that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

599
00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:28.410
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great is hard when something great </v>

600
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:28.540
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hard,</v>

601
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a.</v>

602
00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:34.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not something trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's doesn't matter because because </v>

603
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:39.130
<v Speaker 3>it's great and so every time someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>says to me,</v>

604
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting along with my father.</v>

605
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I married my girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have a child.</v>

606
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.860
<v Speaker 3>We were going to have children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we're going to have children.</v>

607
00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's great man.</v>

608
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

609
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Tell the audience a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson having fun.</v>

610
00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:13.510
<v Speaker 1>We did serious Jordan Peterson Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing for fun.</v>

611
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.170
<v Speaker 3>I stumped him actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I don't.</v>

612
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:28.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like most of what I've always done </v>
<v Speaker 3>for fun in my life has been to play,</v>

613
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when I had little kids,</v>

614
00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:37.111
<v Speaker 3>I played with them all the time and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids are grown up and I play with them </v>

615
00:34:37.111 --> 00:34:39.280
<v Speaker 3>all the time and my daughter is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>playful.</v>

616
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.750
<v Speaker 3>Despite her rather catastrophic life up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this point,</v>

617
00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:49.110
<v Speaker 3>she's much better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is that every single thing she says </v>

618
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.430
<v Speaker 3>when she's not delivering?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

619
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:53.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

620
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:59.070
<v Speaker 3>when she's not focused on talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people about a serious topic,</v>

621
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.210
<v Speaker 3>everything she says is a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

622
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.700
<v Speaker 3>when my son is ridiculously Tz and </v>
<v Speaker 3>playful and so and so,</v>

623
00:35:06.701 --> 00:35:08.890
<v Speaker 3>that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when they were little kids,</v>

624
00:35:08.891 --> 00:35:13.891
<v Speaker 3>we just played all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I really liked that and most of </v>

625
00:35:13.891 --> 00:35:16.630
<v Speaker 3>the people who've been my close friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been people like that.</v>

626
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.660
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They play with their speech all the </v>

627
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.241
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I think I get along with </v>

628
00:35:24.241 --> 00:35:24.241
<v Speaker 3>Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

629
00:35:24.241 --> 00:35:24.241
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's partly why we travel well together.</v>

630
00:35:24.241 --> 00:35:26.350
<v Speaker 3>And John Now my tour manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a great guy,</v>

631
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.730
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very useful.</v>

632
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.820
<v Speaker 3>He's also a comedian and Rogan's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian and so many of the people that </v>

633
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I got along with her comedians and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

634
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:38.870
<v Speaker 3>and the best interviews on how to beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>with comedians because there's that </v>

635
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Speaker 3>element of play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I really like that on this tour.</v>

636
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:47.210
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say we had a good time when </v>

637
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.460
<v Speaker 3>we went to the comedy club in Salt Lake </v>
<v Speaker 3>City,</v>

638
00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Salt Lake City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

639
00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:54.771
<v Speaker 3>that was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was 45 minutes of fun and I had </v>

640
00:35:54.771 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 3>some fun at Cambridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had.</v>

641
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I had some fun in it.</v>

642
00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Just to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought Jordan up as the surprise </v>

643
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.931
<v Speaker 1>guest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did about our standup and then I </v>

644
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:03.931
<v Speaker 1>brought Jordan up and we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sort of did stand up together.</v>

645
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:06.730
<v Speaker 1>We just kind of riff for about 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and people were.</v>

646
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fun.</v>

647
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.100
<v Speaker 1>They were thrilled and they love seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you laugh.</v>

648
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I was at the Cambridge Union just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of days ago and I was in a fairly</v>

649
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.660
<v Speaker 3>high spirited mood and I had a fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of fun with the students there.</v>

650
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.880
<v Speaker 3>It was still serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I really like what the</v>

651
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:27.100
<v Speaker 3>times in my life that I've had the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>time is when I'm sitting around with a </v>

652
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.851
<v Speaker 3>variety of people who are very amusing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all they're trying to do is to </v>

653
00:36:30.851 --> 00:36:34.100
<v Speaker 3>outwit each other with something absurd </v>
<v Speaker 3>and funny and it was really a part of,</v>

654
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's a part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Scandinavian culture or not,</v>

655
00:36:37.911 --> 00:36:39.410
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

656
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.600
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the West where I grew up,</v>

657
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.430
<v Speaker 3>which is a working class culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean most of what my friends and I did</v>

658
00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:51.431
<v Speaker 3>with regards to conversation was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>half winded up,</v>

659
00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.060
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

660
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.540
<v Speaker 3>up men upmanship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's what it is.</v>

661
00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Your goal was to say something funnier </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the person just before you said.</v>

662
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.960
<v Speaker 3>And so it was competitive humor and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

663
00:37:02.961 --> 00:37:07.961
<v Speaker 3>really liked that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when I'm able that's great </v>

664
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.960
<v Speaker 3>relief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this tour,</v>

665
00:37:10.961 --> 00:37:15.230
<v Speaker 3>like it's very tightly scheduled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazily tightly scheduled.</v>

666
00:37:15.231 --> 00:37:20.231
<v Speaker 3>And tammy and I decided at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 3>that because it was such an absurd </v>

667
00:37:20.231 --> 00:37:23.450
<v Speaker 3>opportunity that it was a working tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

668
00:37:23.451 --> 00:37:28.451
<v Speaker 3>and that we were going to subordinate </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything to making sure that these </v>

669
00:37:28.451 --> 00:37:32.261
<v Speaker 3>shows went as well as they possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>could and that we would take whatever </v>

670
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 3>refuge in amusement we could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

671
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.240
<v Speaker 3>where we could steal it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've had some of that.</v>

672
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:43.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean the last time we were in Oslo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we walked up to the sculpture gardens </v>

673
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:47.021
<v Speaker 3>and so that was really cool and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked down the boulevard and we only </v>

674
00:37:47.021 --> 00:37:48.140
<v Speaker 3>had about an hour and a half to take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>look around the city,</v>

675
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.930
<v Speaker 3>but it was a nice hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

676
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.270
<v Speaker 3>the sun was out and we enjoyed </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>

677
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:55.910
<v Speaker 3>And so that's rule 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

678
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Pet a cat on the street when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see one,</v>

679
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:04.210
<v Speaker 3>when you encountered one and you take </v>
<v Speaker 3>your joy where you can get it and you </v>

680
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:07.730
<v Speaker 3>don't complain if it's not happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps as often as it should,</v>

681
00:38:07.731 --> 00:38:12.731
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're given like we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been this absolutely improbable </v>

682
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.900
<v Speaker 3>adventure and we'll have time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully God willing,</v>

683
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.600
<v Speaker 3>knock on wood with some luck for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>more fun in the future.</v>

684
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.290
<v Speaker 1>That's actually quite a segue to my next</v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

685
00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:38.291
<v Speaker 1>which is because you about stories so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much in the importance of stories.</v>

686
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Does the Jordan Peterson story had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy ending and does that even matter </v>

687
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>or what do you think that the ending of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jordan Peterson story is?</v>

688
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have any idea.</v>

689
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

690
00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 3>when I was from the time I was about 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of had a sense of what would </v>

691
00:39:03.861 --> 00:39:06.950
<v Speaker 3>happen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some sense of it,</v>

692
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 3>but only it really only extended until I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was about my age 50,</v>

693
00:39:13.791 --> 00:39:17.060
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't know what would.</v>

694
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a vision for after that.</v>

695
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:20.950
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

696
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.080
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought when I wrote,</v>

697
00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.510
<v Speaker 3>wrote maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember telling one of my,</v>

698
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:32.220
<v Speaker 3>my peers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

699
00:39:32.221 --> 00:39:36.540
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone will think the way that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in this book in 50 years.</v>

700
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:42.260
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's a pretty grandiose claim.</v>

701
00:39:43.051 --> 00:39:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I guess that that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like,</v>

702
00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:45.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough,</v>

703
00:39:45.901 --> 00:39:46.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

704
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.270
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>

705
00:39:48.271 --> 00:39:51.840
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't taking credit for the ideas,</v>

706
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:56.570
<v Speaker 3>like I was taking some credit for </v>
<v Speaker 3>clarifying them.</v>

707
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.780
<v Speaker 3>The ideas were already there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere.</v>

708
00:40:00.781 --> 00:40:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but clarifying the miss something and so</v>

709
00:40:04.591 --> 00:40:09.591
<v Speaker 3>I knew that when I was working on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>maps of meaning was at the center of </v>

710
00:40:09.591 --> 00:40:14.001
<v Speaker 3>things in some sense and that manifested</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself in my teaching career because,</v>

711
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:21.530
<v Speaker 3>well I taught at Harvard for six years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the course there which was based on </v>

712
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:23.310
<v Speaker 3>my book was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very popular and,</v>

713
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.500
<v Speaker 3>and students regarding to this life </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing in the same thing happened at </v>

714
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:28.500
<v Speaker 3>the University of Toronto.</v>

715
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.760
<v Speaker 3>And so I knew that that power was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those ideas,</v>

716
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:38.450
<v Speaker 3>but I don't see my future very clearly </v>
<v Speaker 3>from here on,</v>

717
00:40:39.991 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

718
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:45.120
<v Speaker 3>over the next year I'm going to do more </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what I do it.</v>

719
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.540
<v Speaker 3>I want to return to the exodus to exit </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

720
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I like doing those biblical lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was useful and important.</v>

721
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.860
<v Speaker 3>So I want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my vision kinds of kind of runs out </v>

722
00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.950
<v Speaker 3>in December of 2019 and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

723
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.670
<v Speaker 3>because all of this is so unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.970
<v Speaker 3>our thought for the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single day I thought,</v>

725
00:41:08.971 --> 00:41:12.270
<v Speaker 3>well this is going to come to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is ridiculous.</v>

726
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:17.130
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cad continued but it is continuing.</v>

727
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.720
<v Speaker 3>And so I have no idea how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you predict something like that?</v>

728
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:27.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the longest time I thought that as </v>

729
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.280
<v Speaker 3>this wave grew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that I would end up like</v>

730
00:41:29.281 --> 00:41:34.281
<v Speaker 3>a surfer smashed on the beach was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest probability and I still probably</v>

731
00:41:35.841 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 3>think that that's the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>probability outcome.</v>

732
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:44.130
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not as apprehensive about that </v>

733
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:48.641
<v Speaker 3>now as I was because in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming I don't do anything </v>

734
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.730
<v Speaker 3>spectacularly stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like defend count.</v>

735
00:41:53.731 --> 00:41:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Dang Kyla on Dave Rubin.</v>

736
00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

737
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would like to that?</v>

738
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Who would have liked to have taken me </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

739
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 3>have thrown the worst that they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw at me?</v>

740
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.580
<v Speaker 3>As far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

741
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:17.180
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

742
00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:22.320
<v Speaker 3>my cardinal day in terms of vilification</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's quite a contest by the way </v>

743
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:28.300
<v Speaker 3>because there were many days like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the day where I was simultaneously </v>

744
00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:32.351
<v Speaker 3>accused by eight an all right magazine </v>
<v Speaker 3>of being a Jewish shill and accused by </v>

745
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.640
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Jewish magazine of being tantamount to</v>

746
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Hitler himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

747
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:40.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that pretty much does it.</v>

748
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Nazis hate me because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>a Jewish shill and the,</v>

749
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.320
<v Speaker 3>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this particular Jewish publication,</v>

750
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared me to Hitler,</v>

751
00:42:49.911 --> 00:42:50.480
<v Speaker 3>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

752
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:51.290
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

753
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Where else do you go after that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to call me mom.</v>

754
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it still already.</v>

755
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 3>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just not that much past Hitler.</v>

756
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.760
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I'm not that concerned that in </v>

757
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:07.100
<v Speaker 3>the absence of some fatal stupidity on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my part,</v>

758
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.280
<v Speaker 3>which certainly could still happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we have that proclivity for </v>

759
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.031
<v Speaker 3>fatal stupidity within all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not too concerned that I'm going to </v>

760
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:18.680
<v Speaker 3>be taken out by my ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>opponents,</v>

761
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:24.010
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a pretty unwieldy and </v>

762
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:27.240
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented situation to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm,</v>

763
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not under any illusions about its </v>
<v Speaker 3>stability or safety.</v>

764
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 3>So who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

765
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll stick with you as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll keep me.</v>

766
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far so good.</v>

767
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I promised you guys that I was going </v>

768
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 1>to take what I thought was the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>question from you guys.</v>

769
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.870
<v Speaker 1>And there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were hundreds of them.</v>

770
00:43:45.871 --> 00:43:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I was reading through them during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

771
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but I thought this was the best we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Oslo.</v>

772
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Will you move to as low and run for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prime Minister of Norway?</v>

773
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

774
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Well first you probably want someone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>can speak Norwegian.</v>

775
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and second,</v>

776
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 3>more seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

777
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.680
<v Speaker 3>throughout my life I've considered a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political career and certainly when I </v>

778
00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:32.970
<v Speaker 3>was young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very seriously,</v>

779
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:36.480
<v Speaker 3>that was my ambition till I was about </v>
<v Speaker 3>18.</v>

780
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.920
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

781
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:44.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started when I ran for an executive </v>

782
00:44:46.181 --> 00:44:50.350
<v Speaker 3>position in the Socialist Party in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>home province when I was 14.</v>

783
00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.980
<v Speaker 3>And so that was the first large scale </v>
<v Speaker 3>public speech I gave to about 700 </v>

784
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.940
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

785
00:44:56.941 --> 00:45:01.941
<v Speaker 3>can everyone pause for one second?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to picture 14 year old socialist </v>

786
00:45:01.941 --> 00:45:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an incredible image to me.</v>

787
00:45:03.841 --> 00:45:08.841
<v Speaker 3>What was that kid like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me Kinda,</v>

788
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:11.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

789
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I speak to a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then speech was very successful.</v>

790
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost the position by 13 votes out of </v>

791
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.910
<v Speaker 3>700,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

792
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.090
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the audience under.</v>

793
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.670
<v Speaker 3>I had the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

794
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:38.670
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain things about you that </v>

795
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.670
<v Speaker 3>remained constant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully I know more than I did then,</v>

796
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's to be devoted hope for.</v>

797
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.070
<v Speaker 3>I've stopped</v>

798
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:53.440
<v Speaker 3>actively pursuing a political career </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 18 and the reason for that </v>

799
00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.570
<v Speaker 3>was because I became more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else,</v>

800
00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:01.810
<v Speaker 3>which is what I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight because it turned out that the </v>

801
00:46:02.001 --> 00:46:06.350
<v Speaker 3>political problems that I was interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in were,</v>

802
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:11.760
<v Speaker 3>were deep enough arguably not to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>political because they were really,</v>

803
00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:17.210
<v Speaker 3>for some reason I was very interested in</v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism,</v>

804
00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:20.720
<v Speaker 3>right from the time I was like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adolescent.</v>

805
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why exactly who the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows why you get interested in what </v>

806
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:28.870
<v Speaker 3>your interests in some problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

807
00:46:28.871 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 3>this is a thing that's useful to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>about life,</v>

808
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of you have problems that bothering </v>

809
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

810
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:40.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to have a problem and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough,</v>

811
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:45.410
<v Speaker 3>but like there's a whole lot of problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have that could bother you </v>

812
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:49.190
<v Speaker 3>because there's lots of things wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the world and you can be obsessed </v>

813
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.410
<v Speaker 3>by like a million problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

814
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Because there's just problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>

815
00:46:51.091 --> 00:46:56.091
<v Speaker 3>but you're not some problems grab you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

816
00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a mystery history of the autonomy </v>
<v Speaker 3>of being in some sense,</v>

817
00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.730
<v Speaker 3>problem grabs you and it will let you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

818
00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:11.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's suffering in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's your problem and you know in </v>

819
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:15.430
<v Speaker 3>that problem might be your destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right,</v>

820
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:20.490
<v Speaker 3>is in the problems that grip you are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>portal to your destiny and and so.</v>

821
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Well then you can accept them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

822
00:47:24.671 --> 00:47:27.880
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problems could good luck with that.</v>

823
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:33.240
<v Speaker 3>So you've got your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you learn as a </v>

824
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.841
<v Speaker 3>therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you don't interfere with people's </v>

825
00:47:36.841 --> 00:47:37.930
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I mean by that is this.</v>

826
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:42.931
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you come to me and we have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion about what's going wrong in </v>

827
00:47:42.931 --> 00:47:47.191
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I listened because I want you to </v>

828
00:47:47.191 --> 00:47:48.910
<v Speaker 3>explain what the problems are because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I know about your life?</v>

829
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:53.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like I need to listen so that I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear what your problem is and not rush </v>

830
00:47:55.151 --> 00:48:00.151
<v Speaker 3>to a conclusion and then I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen while you generate a solution.</v>

831
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to help by asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions and help you explore it,</v>

832
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:07.750
<v Speaker 3>but if I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you lay out your problem and I</v>

833
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:08.170
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

834
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:10.510
<v Speaker 3>I know what would fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I just say to you,</v>

835
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:11.130
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

836
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.300
<v Speaker 3>here's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well first of all,</v>

837
00:48:13.301 --> 00:48:18.301
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be very annoyed about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because I just took your problem </v>

838
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.840
<v Speaker 3>and it was up to you to wrestle with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that problem and come up with a solution</v>

839
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:27.841
<v Speaker 3>and then to have a little self </v>
<v Speaker 3>congratulatory burst of pleasure at your</v>

840
00:48:29.501 --> 00:48:34.501
<v Speaker 3>own intuitive genius that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>solve your problem and then then you're </v>

841
00:48:34.501 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 3>motivated because you've come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>

842
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you go implement it right and so</v>

843
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.480
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

844
00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:47.780
<v Speaker 3>So my problem became something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't political and so I pursued that </v>

845
00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.441
<v Speaker 3>and so I'm not going to pursue a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political career and I've also decided </v>

846
00:48:51.441 --> 00:48:51.441
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know this,</v>

847
00:48:51.441 --> 00:48:54.630
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have the temperament for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>

848
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I find the adversarial interviews that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>

849
00:48:59.581 --> 00:49:02.190
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take me like it takes me three days</v>

850
00:49:02.191 --> 00:49:07.191
<v Speaker 3>to recover from one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it does because I don't like that </v>

851
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:12.180
<v Speaker 3>motive discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if your political,</v>

852
00:49:12.181 --> 00:49:16.500
<v Speaker 3>you're in that mode of discourse all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I'm not cut out for it.</v>

853
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.240
<v Speaker 3>I got not a particularly combative </v>
<v Speaker 3>person by nature.</v>

854
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:26.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm a person who's terrified about </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving monsters under the rug</v>

855
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:30.600
<v Speaker 4>ignored,</v>

856
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.700
<v Speaker 3>but that is not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like I enjoy the process of</v>

857
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:39.030
<v Speaker 3>calling them out and hashing them </v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

858
00:49:39.031 --> 00:49:41.970
<v Speaker 3>but I think well better get out them </v>
<v Speaker 3>while they're small.</v>

859
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.430
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

860
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.040
<v Speaker 3>so no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not coming to Norway.</v>

861
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:49.290
<v Speaker 3>That's the answer to that question.</v>

862
00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.830
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well on that note,</v>

863
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I've said this to you privately before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I may as well say publicly since </v>

864
00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:57.890
<v Speaker 1>we're putting this up on the youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this what we're doing here,</v>

865
00:49:57.891 --> 00:50:00.020
<v Speaker 1>this started as a professional joy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

866
00:50:00.021 --> 00:50:03.800
<v Speaker 1>but it has become a personal joy that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't explain.</v>

867
00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:08.801
<v Speaker 1>I am better than when we started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know what it's like to be these </v>

868
00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:10.370
<v Speaker 1>people that taking these ideas in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing and uh,</v>

869
00:50:10.371 --> 00:50:13.850
<v Speaker 1>and I'm better and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because of the work that you've</v>

870

<v Speaker 1>put into your life that you've helped </v>
<v Speaker 1>give to all of us.</v>

871
00:50:16.791 --> 00:50:17.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

872
00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you for that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

874
