1
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I think a healthy dose of skepticism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important attributes one</v>

2
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:07.044
<v Speaker 1>can have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also saying most of us could use a </v>

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:09.414
<v Speaker 1>little more of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys know I'm big on definitions </v>

4
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:12.534
<v Speaker 1>around here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's actually define the word </v>

5
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:15.204
<v Speaker 1>skepticism before we go any further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An attitude of doubt or disposition to </v>

6
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>incredulity either in general or toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular object.</v>

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.113
<v Speaker 1>The doctrine that true knowledge or </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge in a particular area is </v>

8
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The method of suspended judgment,</v>

9
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>systemic doubt or criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of skeptics,</v>

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>doubt concerning basic religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles as a mortality,</v>

11
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.343
<v Speaker 1>providence and revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all skepticism really is then is the </v>

12
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>desire for more information before </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a judgment.</v>

13
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>This seems like a really simple and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty obvious concept,</v>

14
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>yet we're so lacking it in our public </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>

15
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.913
<v Speaker 1>We're so quick to dismiss people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second they say something we don't </v>

16
00:00:58.351 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>We ignore evidence when it doesn't fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>our narrative,</v>

18
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>and too often we pick sides when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really know the facts.</v>

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.683
<v Speaker 1>This is why pundits on cable networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio and online media or yelling all </v>

20
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.244
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of making a compelling argument </v>

21
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:13.974
<v Speaker 1>based on fact and reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just yell with righteous </v>

22
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:17.454
<v Speaker 1>indignation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that what they're saying </v>

23
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>must be true after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really fired up.</v>

24
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>So they must have a true indecent cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually the opposite is true.</v>

26
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just these talking heads.</v>

27
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>You could use a healthy dose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>skepticism.</v>

28
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.513
<v Speaker 1>We're in the midst of an election year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all of us should be skeptical of </v>

29
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.843
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each one of these politicians running </v>

30
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>for office says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't take their word for it.</v>

31
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:41.064
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should question whether what they're </v>

32
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>saying is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take the time to learn the facts.</v>

33
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Politicians prey on an uninformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uninterested,</v>

34
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:49.914
<v Speaker 1>and non skeptical electorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our job as citizens to make them </v>

35
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:53.934
<v Speaker 1>more honest and more forthright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure we all know they're not </v>

36
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>gonna do that on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going even deeper.</v>

37
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not just pundits and politicians we</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be skeptical about,</v>

38
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's also our very selves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word skeptic even has a slight tinge</v>

39
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>of negativity to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:09.661
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

41
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>he's a skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better watch out for him.</v>

42
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.013
<v Speaker 1>All the skeptic actually wants is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>information to form an opinion on the </v>

43
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>world in a rational way using facts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>proven methods.</v>

44
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.533
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not as comforting as blind faith </v>

45
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:23.814
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly isn't as easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps the satisfaction is in the </v>

46
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:27.654
<v Speaker 1>journey of questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guest this week is Michael Shermer </v>

47
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:31.554
<v Speaker 1>and author who has written much on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject and as a thought leader in the </v>

48
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>skeptic movement using science </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvable methods.</v>

49
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>He talks about how we can have morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is based,</v>

50
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fiction.</v>

51
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.853
<v Speaker 1>It's a harder road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is one that more and more people </v>

52
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>seem to be taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also an idea I try to use in all my</v>

53
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first to admit that I don't know</v>

54
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>everything and I'm genuinely curious to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from people of all walks of life.</v>

55
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Talking directly to them is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that we can actually do that.</v>

56
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.073
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 40 characters is nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing like the true </v>

57
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>personal connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

58
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>none of us truly know the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and the answer to the big questions</v>

59
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>we can think we can guess we can create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can destroy,</v>

60
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:15.844
<v Speaker 1>but we simply cannot know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the age old question that will </v>

61
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:19.594
<v Speaker 1>remain until the end of time in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>not knowing is perhaps the most human </v>

62
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.940
<v Speaker 1>trait there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when preachers,</v>

63
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.793
<v Speaker 1>politicians are conspiracy theorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you they know what's really going </v>

64
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:30.694
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just know that they're full of </v>

65
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't knowledge.</v>

66
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer is the author of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

67
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:38.944
<v Speaker 1>the founding publisher of skeptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine and is very skeptical of </v>

68
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>everything I'm saying right now.</v>

69
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are a professional skeptic.</v>

70
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a worrier.</v>

71
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.043
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that I publish a magazine called </v>

72
00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's technically</v>

73
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.281
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:55.281 --> 00:03:57.860
<v Speaker 1>And you run skeptic.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the.</v>

75
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.020
<v Speaker 1>We've got a book called skeptic right </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

76
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a skeptical dude.</v>

77
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I am not by nature necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

78
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.153
<v Speaker 2>I would like to believe lots of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to believe that the stock </v>

79
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 2>market is not catered cratering this </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

80
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to believe that,</v>

81
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:13.301
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 2>aliens are out there and visiting us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was an afterlife,</v>

84
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to live for centuries to see </v>

85
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 2>how all this turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that I'd like it to be true</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make it true,</v>

87
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.614
<v Speaker 2>so I have to kind of override my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective biases and preferences in </v>

88
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 2>favor of the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sometimes hard to fake.</v>

89
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started the show by talking about </v>

90
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:41.771
<v Speaker 1>reason and using logic and science to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a sense of morality,</v>

91
00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:45.410
<v Speaker 1>which you've written a lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we get into that,</v>

92
00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:46.244
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk a little bit about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>history and your sort of evolution to </v>

93
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:50.360
<v Speaker 1>getting to where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

94
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.820
<v Speaker 1>so you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't grow up religious,</v>

95
00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:53.654
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You became religious for a small period </v>

96
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 1>of time around high school or late high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

97
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

98
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.380
<v Speaker 2>I was a evangelical born again </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian,</v>

99
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.920
<v Speaker 2>a in highschool and college for my four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years undergraduate.</v>

100
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.010
<v Speaker 2>And in the start of graduates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about seven years total.</v>

101
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 2>My parents weren't religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't antireligious,</v>

102
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.144
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then the whole atheism thing was </v>

103
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:14.514
<v Speaker 2>not a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just something that most people </v>

104
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:16.614
<v Speaker 2>didn't talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the born again movement was kind of </v>

105
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:21.270
<v Speaker 2>picking up in the seventies and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends were into it in high school,</v>

106
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:22.200
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that,</v>

107
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:23.034
<v Speaker 2>that sort of after parental influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's peer group influence and </v>

108
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.870
<v Speaker 2>that's was my case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friends were doing it.</v>

109
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I remember my friend frank was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious and when I became,</v>

110
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.313
<v Speaker 2>became a born again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened at a Presbyterian church </v>

111
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:35.664
<v Speaker 2>because this other friend of mine went </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and when I came back to school on </v>

112
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Monday until Frank I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Presbyterian church.</v>

113
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.431
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

114
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:44.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the wrong one.</v>

115
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Which one did he wait?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was Jehovah witness.</v>

116
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

117
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.000
<v Speaker 2>wrong one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

118
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:53.100
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was my first inkling that,</v>

119
00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's these little factions and tribes</v>

120
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:56.394
<v Speaker 2>even within the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the Christian Christianity </v>

121
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Movement and anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I take it fairly seriously.</v>

122
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 2>And I went to Bible classes and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to pepperdine,</v>

123
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.480
<v Speaker 2>which is a church of Christ school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very conservative jury.</v>

124
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 2>President Ford came to speak and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

125
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:11.234
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

126
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.700
<v Speaker 2>it was in a bubble where everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed and you know,</v>

127
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the bubble </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically it makes sense,</v>

128
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.583
<v Speaker 2>logically coherent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's internally consistent and </v>

129
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.763
<v Speaker 2>everything falls into place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not really until you're out of </v>

130
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 2>the bubble and you encounter other </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldviews that you think,</v>

131
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe mine's not so solid as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

133
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And that was how I kind of chipped away </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it later.</v>

134
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.123
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of stuff were you </v>

135
00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:36.744
<v Speaker 1>questioning before you got into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble that led you to jumping in and </v>

136
00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:42.460
<v Speaker 1>becoming born again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually before you,</v>

137
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I let you answer that,</v>

138
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.963
<v Speaker 1>when you're born again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think of born again as someone </v>

139
00:06:46.591 --> 00:06:49.530
<v Speaker 1>that's left the religion and comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why they are born again.</v>

140
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Born again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just means</v>

141
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>you're born physically and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>born again.</v>

142
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 2>When you accept Jesus as your savior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of a new.</v>

143
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 2>You start life anew and you get eternal </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

144
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Because you've accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus says,</v>

145
00:07:02.851 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 2>that's what they mean by born again and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and evangelical.</v>

146
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 2>They mean you were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>evangelize.</v>

147
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 2>So this is why evangelicals are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to people about Jesus,</v>

148
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 2>where they hold up the placards at </v>
<v Speaker 2>sporting events.</v>

149
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:17.170
<v Speaker 2>John Three 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for God so loved the world.</v>

150
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.660
<v Speaker 2>He gave his only begotten son for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

151
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>they were the black face and football </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the three John Three 16,</v>

152
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

153
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.690
<v Speaker 1>And then they thank God after they win.</v>

154
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that,</v>

155
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

156
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.710
<v Speaker 2>you wear it on your sleeve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

157
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.130
<v Speaker 2>you're the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shining beacon on the hill.</v>

158
00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:37.131
<v Speaker 2>You do not hide your faith underneath of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Bushel basket to you tell people about</v>

159
00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:38.634
<v Speaker 2>it in a way you kind of have a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation to do so because if you know </v>

160
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.553
<v Speaker 2>that this is the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth and the light and you get </v>

161
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.920
<v Speaker 2>eternal eternity for this person's soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to tell them about it.</v>

162
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 2>They're missing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like the old school,</v>

163
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:56.280
<v Speaker 2>like maybe George H,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w Bush's,</v>

164
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.743
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.390
<v Speaker 2>he was a methodist and they're pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet about it.</v>

166
00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:01.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe what you believe.</v>

167
00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I believe what I believe and we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't talk about it.</v>

168
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 2>A evangelicals not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more like h,</v>

169
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.490
<v Speaker 2>George,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w dot Bush,</v>

170
00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:09.324
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell people Jesus was my favorite </v>

171
00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:14.670
<v Speaker 2>philosopher and I'm a born again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you witnessed people literally going</v>

172
00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:17.340
<v Speaker 2>door to door and I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've knocked justly.</v>

173
00:08:17.341 --> 00:08:17.740
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

174
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So you did all that and then you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bubble.</v>

175
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:24.220
<v Speaker 1>And then what caused the chipping away </v>
<v Speaker 1>that led you to sit here?</v>

176
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to graduate school,</v>

177
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at cal state Fullerton,</v>

178
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:29.350
<v Speaker 2>which is a secular school and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not.</v>

179
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that atheism was a big thing.</v>

180
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 2>It was just that no one was religious or</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were,</v>

181
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:34.684
<v Speaker 2>they were quiet about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I began taking classes in social </v>

182
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:40.120
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropology,</v>

183
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.190
<v Speaker 2>and I can see the psychological basis of</v>
<v Speaker 2>belief and where you happen to have been</v>

184
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 2>born determines what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And particularly in anthropology,</v>

185
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 2>you study all these indigenous peoples </v>
<v Speaker 2>who never even heard of Jesus Christ,</v>

186
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 2>let alone Christianity or anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

187
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:56.401
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

188
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they be condemned?</v>

189
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.380
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

190
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:00.841
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well,</v>

191
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 2>they know God has a special place for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

192
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Little waste station or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

193
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 2>what about the Jews?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

194
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:07.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe pretty much everything I </v>

195
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

196
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 2>But except Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

197
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 2>if God has a special place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

198
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 2>well how does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does this all work?</v>

199
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:15.384
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>

200
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.420
<v Speaker 2>And then also the problem of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought that they see that Chris</v>

201
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Theologians provided a cogent answer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

202
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Why bad things happen to good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean like homicide case that</v>

203
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 2>we have a human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're sinful,</v>

204
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 2>so people do bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the quick answer to that.</v>

205
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Why childhood leukemia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

206
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:37.011
<v Speaker 2>why tsunamis that wipe out entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>villages have tiny children that,</v>

207
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should,</v>

208
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.380
<v Speaker 2>why do they have to suffer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

209
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 2>And beyond the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because God works in mysterious ways and</v>

210
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 2>he has a plan for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was never satisfying to me.</v>

211
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pretty much did it in a.</v>

212
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 2>and then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I wrote about this,</v>

213
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.320
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend at the time was in a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>accident and broke her back and uh,</v>

215
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 2>and I was pretty much on the way out at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>

216
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.680
<v Speaker 2>but I remember it being at the emergency</v>
<v Speaker 2>room thinking this poor woman.</v>

217
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is the sweetest lady and w why would</v>

218
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>this happen to her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not right,</v>

219
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:07.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I sort of made one last ditch effort </v>

220
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 2>and prayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

221
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:12.324
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that this was the big test and </v>

222
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 2>if it fails and I won't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

223
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what course he's still paralyzed today.</v>

224
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

225
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.441
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think there's anybody up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there pulling the strings.</v>

227
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you think so many people are </v>

228
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 1>just afraid to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

229
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.393
<v Speaker 1>because that seems to me to be the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>question and the real basis of sort of </v>

230
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:34.224
<v Speaker 1>everything that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not proclaiming to know any sort </v>

231
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:38.570
<v Speaker 1>of wisdom that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

232
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:38.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

233
00:10:38.961 --> 00:10:39.794
<v Speaker 1>we know different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not proclaiming to have the </v>

234
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 1>answers and people are so afraid of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

235
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think that's about?</v>

236
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:46.911
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

237
00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I think cognitively we know now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>once you comprehend a,</v>

238
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.540
<v Speaker 2>an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concept,</v>

239
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

240
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain automatically just believes it</v>

241
00:10:57.891 --> 00:10:58.724
<v Speaker 2>to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just accepts it as part of the factual </v>

242
00:11:00.471 --> 00:11:01.304
<v Speaker 2>world that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then being skeptical of it or </v>

243
00:11:05.301 --> 00:11:06.200
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

244
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I challenges is an extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive load.</v>

245
00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:11.030
<v Speaker 2>You can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of people do.</v>

246
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.320
<v Speaker 2>So think of the difference between type </v>
<v Speaker 2>one and type two thinking type one.</v>

247
00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Cognition is rapid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive,</v>

248
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:18.284
<v Speaker 2>instinctive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional type two thinking is </v>

249
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.980
<v Speaker 2>deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow,</v>

250
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.300
<v Speaker 2>methodical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rational,</v>

251
00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

252
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and most of our thought processes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we initiate our type one,</v>

253
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:30.314
<v Speaker 2>we just kind of a feeling about things </v>
<v Speaker 2>we gut instinct go about the world and </v>

254
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.070
<v Speaker 2>type two requires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay wait,</v>

255
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.820
<v Speaker 2>let me stop and think about maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't make that investment.</v>

256
00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'd better not marry this person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I shouldn't buy that company.</v>

257
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is that requires additional </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps.</v>

258
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:46.250
<v Speaker 2>So that's an extra cognitive load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uncomfortable,</v>

259
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 2>it takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

260
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.230
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

261
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.083
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's true with religious beliefs </v>

262
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.800
<v Speaker 2>it just feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

264
00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.730
<v Speaker 2>the earth is the center of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

265
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.180
<v Speaker 2>we're the center of creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's here for me,</v>

266
00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

267
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that happens,</v>

268
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:04.380
<v Speaker 2>happens for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just kinda feels right.</v>

269
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.383
<v Speaker 1>So it's really just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just as simple as comfort </v>

270
00:12:07.461 --> 00:12:08.294
<v Speaker 1>really is what you were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like there is some stuff out </v>

271
00:12:10.551 --> 00:12:11.384
<v Speaker 1>there that I don't understand and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>better just pick this belief because </v>

272
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.540
<v Speaker 1>then I don't have to spend that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental energy.</v>

273
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.890
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 2>the creationist arguments or arguments </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people about,</v>

275
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:25.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who built the pyramids or whatever.</v>

276
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well God did it or the aliens did it.</v>

277
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then for me to deconstruct the whole</v>

278
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:32.980
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a debate or on a TV show,</v>

279
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go through,</v>

280
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know what happened?</v>

281
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I got 15 minutes to explain natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection or,</v>

282
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

283
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just easier to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

284
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.420
<v Speaker 2>God did it man.</v>

285
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.390
<v Speaker 1>So there's some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

286
00:12:44.391 --> 00:12:45.224
<v Speaker 1>the way our technology works now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're twitter of 140 characters and </v>

287
00:12:48.561 --> 00:12:50.630
<v Speaker 1>buying of six seconds and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

288
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Those are what you just described it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are type one thinking,</v>

289
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:54.314
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's just quick easy stuff and </v>

290
00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:02.090
<v Speaker 1>this I guess is type two where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going in and out of an idea,</v>

291
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 1>but in a way it would be really hard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>type two to ever win the great debate,</v>

292
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't have time.</v>

293
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.720
<v Speaker 2>It does win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it takes time and it's delivered and</v>

294
00:13:11.721 --> 00:13:13.880
<v Speaker 2>it takes effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uncomfortable.</v>

295
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sam is a doctoral thesis,</v>

296
00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:21.680
<v Speaker 2>was based on this idea of scanning </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains while they read a while.</v>

297
00:13:21.681 --> 00:13:23.960
<v Speaker 2>People read statements that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously true,</v>

298
00:13:23.961 --> 00:13:25.490
<v Speaker 2>obviously fall through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell,</v>

299
00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:28.350
<v Speaker 2>you just don't know any show that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

300
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:29.180
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

301
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.013
<v Speaker 2>that the brain activity is very rapid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and simple and easy and positively </v>

302
00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:37.730
<v Speaker 2>reinforced with dopamine for questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were obviously true or false.</v>

303
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.610
<v Speaker 2>The ones where you had to deliberate on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>

304
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.920
<v Speaker 2>where the areas of the brain that lit </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

305
00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:44.990
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only did it happen slower,</v>

306
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:45.824
<v Speaker 2>but they were associated with things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like bad smell and discussed and </v>

307
00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:51.150
<v Speaker 2>negative emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so really you know,</v>

308
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.390
<v Speaker 2>an idea that stinks or an idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>

309
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.640
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being skeptical saying,</v>

310
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.563
<v Speaker 2>I now comprehend this and I doubted it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit like why line is </v>

311
00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:01.934
<v Speaker 2>cognitively a heavier load because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to know what the truth is and then </v>

312
00:14:06.051 --> 00:14:07.130
<v Speaker 2>take another step and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

313
00:14:07.131 --> 00:14:07.964
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to manipulate the truth in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular way and I have to </v>

314
00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:13.280
<v Speaker 2>remember both of those and then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell it to a third person.</v>

315
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got three different stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>

316
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.173
<v Speaker 2>so that load gets heavier and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder and it's just easier to go the </v>

317
00:14:19.521 --> 00:14:20.354
<v Speaker 2>simple route.</v>

318
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you happen to see Sam's blog post </v>

319
00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:26.610
<v Speaker 1>around Christmas time about lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting a fire?</v>

320
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.673
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a really interesting piece </v>

321
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:30.120
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

322
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:30.954
<v Speaker 1>it's not just couched in religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what his point was that </v>

323
00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:37.980
<v Speaker 1>he said he was saying that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>comforted by a nice fireplace fire,</v>

324
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.963
<v Speaker 1>but then he goes into the carcinogens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and toxins and all this horrible stuff </v>

325
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.540
<v Speaker 1>and I read it that day and then I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>light a fire to that.</v>

326
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I read it on Christmas Eve and I</v>

327
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:52.580
<v Speaker 1>lit a fire and I think it illustrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>his point perfectly.</v>

328
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Like we have this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really like the fire,</v>

329
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:56.594
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really nice comforting thing and </v>

330
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 1>then we can cognitively know that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a lot of damage to us.</v>

331
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 1>So not all crazy beliefs and crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions are sort of based in religion.</v>

332
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.020
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it goes across the spectrum.</v>

333
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.243
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens or deities for atheist is like </v>

334
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:15.710
<v Speaker 2>all of them were even if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in God,</v>

335
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's somebody out there who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking out for us,</v>

336
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:21.050
<v Speaker 2>who knows we're here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 2>loves this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe looking out for us morally,</v>

338
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:24.614
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of how aliens are described </v>

339
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 2>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is like somebody cares about me.</v>

340
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you feel good.</v>

341
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.760
<v Speaker 2>The afterlife is like that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

342
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 2>we're all set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scores are settled,</v>

343
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:36.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

344
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:37.814
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you get to have the perfect body </v>

345
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 2>and you're 29 years old and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

346
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:43.390
<v Speaker 2>and so on and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

347
00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 2>and all justice is served and that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels good.</v>

348
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:47.354
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way the world should be and </v>

349
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:50.090
<v Speaker 2>you can just look around and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

350
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

351
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny what people take comfort </v>

352
00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:56.250
<v Speaker 1>in because just this past weekend I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the history channel that,</v>

353
00:15:56.251 --> 00:15:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone from what once was history,</v>

354
00:15:58.381 --> 00:16:00.120
<v Speaker 1>now they do a lot of God stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

355
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So I think it was God versus the devil </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the name of the show or God first God</v>

356
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.530
<v Speaker 1>versus Satan or one of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was so much horrible imagery,</v>

357
00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:08.364
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burning people and endless war and </v>

358
00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:13.890
<v Speaker 1>armageddon and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kept thinking the entire time.</v>

359
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.023
<v Speaker 1>This is incredible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is what people are taking </v>

360
00:16:16.591 --> 00:16:19.620
<v Speaker 1>comfort in what it was pretty horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

361
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So that right there shows a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>system</v>

362
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.253
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So part of that is that we're also </v>

363
00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:27.190
<v Speaker 2>moralizing animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moralizing primates,</v>

364
00:16:27.191 --> 00:16:29.710
<v Speaker 2>we care deeply about justice and right </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrong.</v>

365
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just we want a good life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy life,</v>

366
00:16:32.771 --> 00:16:36.930
<v Speaker 2>a life with plenty of food and water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>milk and honey and you know,</v>

367
00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that we want to,</v>

368
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.813
<v Speaker 2>we want to cause we can be behind that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we feel is a good cause and all causes </v>

369
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.960
<v Speaker 2>have to have an antique cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

370
00:16:45.961 --> 00:16:46.794
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who's preventing us from achieving </v>

371
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:49.900
<v Speaker 2>this utopia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's those guys,</v>

372
00:16:49.901 --> 00:16:52.240
<v Speaker 2>those bad guys over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

373
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:53.074
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're preventing us from having </v>

374
00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:57.400
<v Speaker 2>eternal bliss forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How bad are they?</v>

375
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.770
<v Speaker 2>They are really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does that mean?</v>

376
00:16:59.771 --> 00:17:02.500
<v Speaker 2>We can do to them whatever we want </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're so bad.</v>

377
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's what leads to genocide and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars and conflicts.</v>

378
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Even homicides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

379
00:17:07.031 --> 00:17:09.280
<v Speaker 2>90 percent of homicides are moralistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>in nature.</v>

380
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.980
<v Speaker 2>That guy deserved to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

381
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he scratched my car,</v>

382
00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:15.610
<v Speaker 2>he insulted me or he stole my girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

383
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:16.690
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always these,</v>

384
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:17.913
<v Speaker 2>these kind of moralistic reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was an interesting commentary on </v>

385
00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:22.534
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

386
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.040
<v Speaker 2>recently about the interest in trump and</v>
<v Speaker 2>other strong leaders and then reflecting</v>

387
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:27.874
<v Speaker 2>back on the interest of in Mussolini and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler Back in the thirties and George </v>

388
00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:34.600
<v Speaker 2>orwell writing about this saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really get this.</v>

389
00:17:34.601 --> 00:17:35.434
<v Speaker 2>You can see the passion and the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that Hitler or Mussolini </v>

390
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:39.724
<v Speaker 2>said I will give you economic prosperity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and jobs and in three square meals a </v>

391
00:17:43.511 --> 00:17:44.344
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that we are going to change the </v>

392
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:46.564
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to make Germany great </v>

393
00:17:47.741 --> 00:17:48.880
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really great.</v>

394
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's about easy answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then right?</v>

395
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:52.314
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to your type one thinking and </v>

396
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:56.410
<v Speaker 1>these guys like trump that just black </v>
<v Speaker 1>and white,</v>

397
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 1>black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple simple stuff.</v>

398
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.903
<v Speaker 1>So how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is I guess really what you've </v>

399
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:02.574
<v Speaker 1>done sort of more than how do we wrestle</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conversation back and get it to a </v>

400
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:10.330
<v Speaker 1>place where people are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolate ideas and,</v>

401
00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:13.380
<v Speaker 1>and open them up and get in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really figure out what's going on.</v>

402
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.843
<v Speaker 1>How do we do it?</v>

403
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do what we're doing now,</v>

404
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 2>but most people don't sit down like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

405
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:20.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to a bar or whatever and it's,</v>

406
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.493
<v Speaker 2>it's much more black and white and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>part I think the diffusion of culture </v>

407
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:29.550
<v Speaker 2>through the Internet and all the radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>stations and television stations helps,</v>

408
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:30.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the,</v>

409
00:18:30.831 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 2>a history channel two with the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>alien and stuff,</v>

410
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:33.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

411
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 2>are all formally all Hitler all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

412
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Now it's all conspiracy then is all </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigfoot foot.</v>

413
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Then it's all aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

414
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least there's.</v>

415
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.073
<v Speaker 1>And I love that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we're going to talk a little </v>

416
00:18:43.131 --> 00:18:44.360
<v Speaker 1>bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that stuff,</v>

417
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:45.860
<v Speaker 1>but I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:47.300
<v Speaker 1>they're just playing with your mind.</v>

419
00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.453
<v Speaker 2>It's good to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Television is a series of commercials </v>

420
00:18:51.771 --> 00:18:52.604
<v Speaker 2>with blank spots in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be filled with something </v>

421
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:56.570
<v Speaker 2>interesting to keep you from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>clicker.</v>

422
00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.970
<v Speaker 2>The clicker culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

423
00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.050
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

424
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 2>and then literacy rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more of that,</v>

425
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.010
<v Speaker 2>more literate people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more they read,</v>

426
00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:07.100
<v Speaker 2>the more options they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's true twitter,</v>

427
00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:07.934
<v Speaker 2>140 characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can embed a link to an article </v>

428
00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:14.600
<v Speaker 2>that maybe is 3000 words and then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>from there you go to the 10,000</v>

429
00:19:14.601 --> 00:19:16.370
<v Speaker 2>word analysis from there you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

430
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.310
<v Speaker 2>And so any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a book author,</v>

431
00:19:19.311 --> 00:19:20.144
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to think maybe I'm dilute </v>

432
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.260
<v Speaker 2>delusional here that people still like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to read long books.</v>

433
00:19:24.261 --> 00:19:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I hope and move from the twitter to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

434
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:28.840
<v Speaker 2>to face.</v>

435
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.401
<v Speaker 1>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

436
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:30.234
<v Speaker 1>I hope so too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm doing this and that's </v>

437
00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:33.220
<v Speaker 1>exactly what I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting.</v>

438
00:19:33.221 --> 00:19:38.221
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about why people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done bad things in the name of morality,</v>

439
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.690
<v Speaker 1>but how do we get morality than without </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion?</v>

440
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.793
<v Speaker 1>How do we using science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what you've written a lot </v>

441
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:47.374
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we use science to get some sense </v>

442
00:19:49.061 --> 00:19:49.894
<v Speaker 1>of morality so we don't end up doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same things that the religious people </v>

443
00:19:52.811 --> 00:19:53.570
<v Speaker 1>are doing?</v>

444
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.291
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

445
00:19:54.291 --> 00:19:55.700
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it starts with the idea,</v>

446
00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.440
<v Speaker 2>the recognition that that moral values </v>
<v Speaker 2>are part of our human nature.</v>

447
00:20:00.441 --> 00:20:01.274
<v Speaker 2>We have a sense of right and wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice and it's built into us and you </v>

448
00:20:04.281 --> 00:20:06.710
<v Speaker 2>can see it in all humans and actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>all primates,</v>

449
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.160
<v Speaker 2>even other mammals like elephants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs and so on.</v>

450
00:20:10.161 --> 00:20:12.830
<v Speaker 2>They have a sense of guilt and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

451
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.770
<v Speaker 2>and shame and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

452
00:20:14.771 --> 00:20:15.604
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have a certain amount of </v>

453
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.650
<v Speaker 2>empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathy,</v>

454
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.990
<v Speaker 2>cooperativeness as well as selfishness </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredient and so on.</v>

455
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:25.610
<v Speaker 2>They have these suite of moral emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe scaled down from what we have,</v>

456
00:20:25.611 --> 00:20:27.950
<v Speaker 2>but so it's there in our nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We evolved it,</v>

457
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.130
<v Speaker 2>we got it as part of the package of just</v>
<v Speaker 2>being human.</v>

458
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.490
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was just a survival thing,</v>

459
00:20:33.491 --> 00:20:35.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just a Darwin,</v>

460
00:20:35.231 --> 00:20:37.090
<v Speaker 1>like you have to play nice with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they're going to.</v>

461
00:20:37.091 --> 00:20:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

462
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.983
<v Speaker 2>So you start with something like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins' selfish gene model and you </v>

463
00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:43.201
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

464
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.080
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>

465
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.943
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would a self replicating molecule </v>

466
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.850
<v Speaker 2>to perpetuate itself into the future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

467
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.783
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be build a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cell to put itself in and then </v>

468
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:56.860
<v Speaker 2>multiple cells and then an organism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:57.694
<v Speaker 2>survival machine to carry it forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our bodies are behold into the the </v>

470
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.833
<v Speaker 2>genes we are the genes survival machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why shouldn't I just be as </v>

471
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.770
<v Speaker 2>selfish and greedy as I possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoard all the resources,</v>

472
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:15.640
<v Speaker 2>take all your stuff in our knock you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head and take you know well,</v>

473
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:16.474
<v Speaker 2>because you would do the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculation is me and I know that you </v>

474
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:20.284
<v Speaker 2>know that I might be thinking that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you know that I know that you </v>

475
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:23.824
<v Speaker 2>might be thinking that and so therefore </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's better if I'm just nice to </v>

476
00:21:26.861 --> 00:21:27.694
<v Speaker 2>you and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't just fake and pretend I'm a </v>

477
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 2>nice person because in time you will </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up the cues,</v>

478
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:34.924
<v Speaker 2>subtle cues that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not genuine in my feelings about </v>

479
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

480
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm just coldly manipulating your </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions to get something in time.</v>

481
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:45.040
<v Speaker 2>People can see that in other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't just fake it.</v>

482
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:45.874
<v Speaker 2>You have to actually believe it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually feel like I want to be a good </v>

483
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.680
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

484
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.623
<v Speaker 2>and so you have that tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the good moral emotions and the </v>

485
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:56.110
<v Speaker 2>dark side of emotions and they're there </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all of this.</v>

486
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.670
<v Speaker 1>So isn't that strange though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that does show sort of,</v>

487
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.533
<v Speaker 1>you're giving me the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation of why to be good and then </v>

488
00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:07.260
<v Speaker 1>at the same time that is sort of why </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion would tell people to be good to</v>

489
00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:08.094
<v Speaker 1>write to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to better their community or to work </v>

490
00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:11.214
<v Speaker 1>with people or that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is some place that you could </v>

491
00:22:13.771 --> 00:22:14.950
<v Speaker 1>use both of those things?</v>

492
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

493
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.453
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what religions discovered this </v>

494
00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:18.944
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by trial and error over thousands of </v>

495
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.913
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain things that we </v>

496
00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:24.800
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do because most people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

497
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

498
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.920
<v Speaker 2>killing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of thing.</v>

499
00:22:27.921 --> 00:22:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Even though there's a lot of bands </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible,</v>

500
00:22:29.691 --> 00:22:31.460
<v Speaker 2>they kind of figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

501
00:22:31.461 --> 00:22:33.470
<v Speaker 2>we're a community so we need a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

502
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we disagree about the rules,</v>

503
00:22:35.421 --> 00:22:36.254
<v Speaker 2>but Dang it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need the rules and everybody has to </v>

504
00:22:37.431 --> 00:22:38.081
<v Speaker 2>obey him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it,</v>

505
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:40.250
<v Speaker 2>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there'll be punishments.</v>

506
00:22:40.251 --> 00:22:42.830
<v Speaker 2>And if you think you got away with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was no one around,</v>

507
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.910
<v Speaker 2>there's an eye in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.753
<v Speaker 2>this is in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that basis of God beliefs and in part </v>

509
00:22:48.381 --> 00:22:50.450
<v Speaker 2>there's multiple reasons for God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's one of them.</v>

510
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.261
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

511
00:22:51.261 --> 00:22:53.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a moral eye in the sky keeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>track.</v>

512
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a psychopath and know care.</v>

513
00:22:55.281 --> 00:22:55.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

514
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:56.624
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the bulk of the population that </v>

515
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:01.200
<v Speaker 2>would work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in a way,</v>

516
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conservative Christian belief in the</v>

517
00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:05.744
<v Speaker 2>sinful nature of humans is in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way a Darwinian model as well </v>

518
00:23:10.341 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 2>because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're greedy and we,</v>

519
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.750
<v Speaker 2>if we think we can get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might.</v>

520
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 2>So in a sort of like a prisoner's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dilemma,</v>

521
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Game Theory Type Model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

522
00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:20.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tit for tat in,</v>

523
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.793
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll start off cooperating and if you </v>

524
00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:25.820
<v Speaker 2>cooperate I'll cooperate again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you defect that I'm gonna,</v>

525
00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna nail you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

526
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:29.640
<v Speaker 2>that desire to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

527
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Speaker 2>to nail you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

528
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.250
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

529
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.620
<v Speaker 2>to get justice for the thing you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was wrong.</v>

530
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.323
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the Gandhian turn the other </v>

531
00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:39.740
<v Speaker 2>cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus turned the other cheek.</v>

532
00:23:39.741 --> 00:23:40.574
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good game theory strategy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that just means you'll be </v>

533
00:23:43.071 --> 00:23:44.610
<v Speaker 2>exploited by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

534
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.453
<v Speaker 2>It never works out well for that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately it doesn't and it won't </v>

535
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 2>work for a whole society that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of societies won't survive because</v>

536
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 2>other groups will or clans or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll try,</v>

537
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.300
<v Speaker 2>we'll take them over so it actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>helps to cultivate a reputation of being</v>

538
00:23:59.301 --> 00:24:00.900
<v Speaker 2>a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

539
00:24:00.901 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you take my stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kick your ass.</v>

540
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.741
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

541
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:04.401
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

542
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:04.941
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all right.</v>

543
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:05.774
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

544
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.933
<v Speaker 2>well you're coming from</v>

545
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.970
<v Speaker 1>to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using a moral compass,</v>

546
00:24:09.971 --> 00:24:10.804
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

547
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.360
<v Speaker 1>you're saying I'm doing this sort of for</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

548
00:24:13.361 --> 00:24:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but that in itself is sort of for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater good.</v>

549
00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

550
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bite.</v>

551
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 2>The greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out to be a byproduct,</v>

552
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:22.580
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments you can make that,</v>

553
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.830
<v Speaker 2>but that actually really is good for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

554
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:25.664
<v Speaker 2>Not a group selection argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that the more of us individuals </v>

555
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:29.864
<v Speaker 2>that are cooperating within our group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our group will be better off for that </v>

556
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 2>group is not the target of selection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still the individuals,</v>

557
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.763
<v Speaker 2>but societies are better off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I argue in the moral arc is </v>

558
00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:40.770
<v Speaker 2>that over the centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

559
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.683
<v Speaker 2>tweaking social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political and economic systems this way </v>

560
00:24:44.061 --> 00:24:44.894
<v Speaker 2>and this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been kind of hovering around this </v>

561
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:48.194
<v Speaker 2>idea that there is a better way to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>for in a utilitarian type or more of us </v>

562
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:53.624
<v Speaker 2>will be better off and live longer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperous and healthy lives if we do </v>

563
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.200
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather than that,</v>

564
00:24:58.201 --> 00:25:01.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a democracy versus a dictatorship,</v>

565
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:02.054
<v Speaker 2>a relatively free markets of trading and</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing people to do it their thing </v>

566
00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:07.634
<v Speaker 2>versus a command and control economy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in North Korea or having a set of </v>

567
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:14.420
<v Speaker 2>rules and the rule of law and a police </v>
<v Speaker 2>force has good,</v>

568
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:15.950
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good fences,</v>

569
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 2>make good neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

570
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 2>we've been doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these experiments.</v>

571
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like a science.</v>

572
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:22.911
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

573
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:24.620
<v Speaker 2>let's run the experiment and see how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes.</v>

574
00:25:24.621 --> 00:25:25.454
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll tweak the variables in </v>
<v Speaker 2>four years called an election and we'll </v>

575
00:25:28.101 --> 00:25:30.230
<v Speaker 2>try it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no,</v>

576
00:25:30.231 --> 00:25:32.480
<v Speaker 2>they're there to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no utopia.</v>

577
00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:34.610
<v Speaker 2>We're just trying to make a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of progress.</v>

578
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.630
<v Speaker 2>So we'll increase taxes there and lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>him there.</v>

579
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Will will change the gun control flaws </v>
<v Speaker 2>here but not there.</v>

580
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And we'll seat list to see what happens.</v>

581
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.653
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying when politicians </v>

582
00:25:44.261 --> 00:25:46.090
<v Speaker 1>promise they can fix everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not actually.</v>

583
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what you're saying.</v>

584
00:25:47.941 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a shocker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

585
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.223
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of people that would </v>

586
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:58.100
<v Speaker 1>believe everything that you've said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived their lives in a secular way using</v>

587
00:25:58.101 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>science and reasoning and their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal morality to guide their lives,</v>

588
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:07.660
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time do take that leap </v>
<v Speaker 1>of faith and still believe in some crazy</v>

589
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:09.014
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still believed that maybe there's </v>

590
00:26:09.921 --> 00:26:12.020
<v Speaker 1>someone upstairs watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think.</v>

591
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.873
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably where most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people fall that they do live their </v>

592
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:17.054
<v Speaker 1>lives based in secular ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time if you really sat </v>

593
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:22.094
<v Speaker 1>them down and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

594
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people want to believe at the </v>

595
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:27.070
<v Speaker 1>end that they're going to go and play </v>
<v Speaker 1>tennis with God,</v>

596
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will there be competition in heaven?</v>

597
00:26:30.661 --> 00:26:33.120
<v Speaker 2>This is what I want to know because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too boring,</v>

598
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing to do with challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it wouldn't be worried.</v>

599
00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:37.394
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be worth it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you make of that type of </v>

600
00:26:40.921 --> 00:26:42.960
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a super good point.</v>

601
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.333
<v Speaker 2>In reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most say conservative Christians today </v>

602
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 2>are more liberal socially than liberals </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in the fifties say,</v>

603
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.730
<v Speaker 2>but they don't even know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

604
00:26:52.731 --> 00:26:53.521
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>

605
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:53.761
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

606
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this because it says so in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible and I'm a Christian,</v>

607
00:26:57.091 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 2>and Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

608
00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:59.220
<v Speaker 2>it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

609
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.054
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus should love all the gays and </v>

610
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.270
<v Speaker 2>blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it was like,</v>

611
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.070
<v Speaker 2>where does he say that and where are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting this?</v>

612
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 2>But I know where they're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting from culture.</v>

613
00:27:07.411 --> 00:27:10.500
<v Speaker 2>That's been shifting for decades from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom up,</v>

614
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:11.334
<v Speaker 2>just from everybody changing the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk and think about shows or </v>

615
00:27:14.791 --> 00:27:15.624
<v Speaker 2>presented a scripts are written novels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>books and so forth and all of us have </v>

616
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 2>changed our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our expanded,</v>

617
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:25.971
<v Speaker 2>our moral sphere to be more encompassing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that the standouts like the,</v>

618
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.233
<v Speaker 2>the Donald Sterling's of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who insults African-americans is the </v>

619
00:27:30.661 --> 00:27:31.590
<v Speaker 2>owner of the clippers.</v>

620
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.000
<v Speaker 2>his life is just ruined for this idiotic</v>
<v Speaker 2>statements.</v>

622
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.340
<v Speaker 2>But most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the guys back in the fifties used to</v>

623
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:39.174
<v Speaker 2>think like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was Kinda like that and it's </v>

624
00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:43.890
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad can't say that anymore.</v>

625
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of the scary things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>society's changing too quickly?</v>

626
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I,</v>

627
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.293
<v Speaker 1>I follow you on twitter and you do push </v>
<v Speaker 1>against some of this regressive left </v>

628
00:27:53.211 --> 00:27:54.044
<v Speaker 1>stuff and some of the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior stuff because in a way they're </v>

629
00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.360
<v Speaker 1>gonna come for us to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things will keep changing.</v>

630
00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:00.194
<v Speaker 1>And then some of the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying right now that don't sound </v>

631
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.560
<v Speaker 1>controversial at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

632
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.710
<v Speaker 1>depending on the way we evolve in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the way ideas,</v>

633
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that they move throughout time,</v>

634
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.420
<v Speaker 1>someone 20 years from now could look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and say,</v>

635
00:28:11.421 --> 00:28:12.254
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see schermer was a real big it for </v>

636
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.290
<v Speaker 1>some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't even think of it.</v>

637
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

638
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:16.853
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

639
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.630
<v Speaker 2>of course we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

640
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 2>we worry about that or wonder about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

641
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

642
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.550
<v Speaker 2>we look back on say the debates about </v>
<v Speaker 2>interracial marriage.</v>

643
00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:25.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like what were they thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

644
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

645
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last year,</v>

646
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 2>looking back at gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were they thinking?</v>

647
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 2>We know what their thinking is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>recent.</v>

648
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.910
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now what are we thinking now that in</v>

649
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:37.160
<v Speaker 2>20 years people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

650
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.250
<v Speaker 2>what were here?</v>

651
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.410
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

652
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:40.483
<v Speaker 1>I think about that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tweeting out all this stuff all the </v>

653
00:28:41.811 --> 00:28:43.760
<v Speaker 1>time and he's 20 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone going to go,</v>

654
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.620
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy was a complete lunatic.</v>

655
00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:46.520
<v Speaker 1>And they might be saying it now.</v>

656
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Well we don't know because we're buried </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the culture.</v>

657
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.833
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say just projecting forward </v>

658
00:28:51.951 --> 00:28:53.670
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

659
00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.780
<v Speaker 2>the rights of the unborn in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean fetuses,</v>

660
00:28:56.781 --> 00:29:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean future generations to inhabited </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth that's habitable.</v>

661
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.750
<v Speaker 2>That is there's resources available and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>

662
00:29:02.751 --> 00:29:06.050
<v Speaker 2>So the environmental movement I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of that.</v>

663
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

664
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.670
<v Speaker 2>that would be one area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Artificial intelligence is maybe another</v>

665
00:29:10.671 --> 00:29:12.800
<v Speaker 2>one is data a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.140
<v Speaker 2>do they have personhood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

667
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.153
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things I think we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about those are not particularly </v>

668
00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:19.760
<v Speaker 2>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

669
00:29:19.761 --> 00:29:22.910
<v Speaker 2>the social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so called the regressive left.</v>

670
00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:25.070
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting term that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught on.</v>

671
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a measure.</v>

672
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

673
00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:31.904
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an example of how far for first </v>

674
00:29:35.001 --> 00:29:36.290
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far we've come,</v>

675
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.153
<v Speaker 2>how much moral progress we've made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the biggest thing on your plate as </v>

676
00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 2>a college student is to protest </v>
<v Speaker 2>costumes.</v>

677
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

678
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means things are pretty dang good.</v>

679
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 1>So is that the part that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on more than.</v>

680
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Because I do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

681
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:52.474
<v Speaker 1>we all get in this big workup frenzy </v>
<v Speaker 1>over this stuff and they sent out this </v>

682
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:56.524
<v Speaker 1>letter and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want them to wear offensive </v>

683
00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Halloween costumes or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to that,</v>

684
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 1>if you just look at it in that narrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

685
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

686
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 1>free speech is really being attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at it,</v>

687
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:07.894
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it from the broader </v>

688
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.360
<v Speaker 1>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

689
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what's left now we're just fighting</v>

690
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 1>over Halloween costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense,</v>

691
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:16.810
<v Speaker 1>things really have progressed really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

692
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You compare it to say what students were</v>

693
00:30:20.061 --> 00:30:22.100
<v Speaker 2>protesting in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

694
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.710
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

695
00:30:24.711 --> 00:30:26.370
<v Speaker 2>that's science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also the,</v>

696
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.260
<v Speaker 2>these moral pendulums tend to swing back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth to one extreme to the other.</v>

697
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think it has gone too far now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

698
00:30:32.811 --> 00:30:33.644
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

699
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.543
<v Speaker 2>it seems like free speech as a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle is being trumped by other </v>

700
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.793
<v Speaker 2>moral values that some people hold the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to not hear something </v>

701
00:30:43.791 --> 00:30:45.890
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable or offensive or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

702
00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.593
<v Speaker 2>I was arguing this back in the nineties </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Holocaust deniers when I wrote </v>

703
00:30:49.791 --> 00:30:50.624
<v Speaker 2>my book on the gated them when they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of big and Canada had anti </v>

704
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:56.983
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust denial laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was incorporated under their hate </v>

705
00:30:59.211 --> 00:31:00.044
<v Speaker 2>speech laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember first reading about this </v>

706
00:31:01.431 --> 00:31:02.690
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate speech.</v>

707
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.510
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that hates if you're Jewish.</v>

708
00:31:05.511 --> 00:31:06.500
<v Speaker 2>I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

709
00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.710
<v Speaker 2>but who's actually being harmed by this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>

710
00:31:09.711 --> 00:31:11.730
<v Speaker 2>you could just just shine a light on </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

711
00:31:11.731 --> 00:31:12.564
<v Speaker 2>You just black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are and they'll go nowhere because </v>

712
00:31:15.351 --> 00:31:19.010
<v Speaker 2>they don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why suppress them and lock them up?</v>

713
00:31:19.011 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 2>And then I remember when David Irving </v>
<v Speaker 2>got arrested in Austria,</v>

714
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.743
<v Speaker 2>he didn't even say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just going to give a lecture and </v>

715
00:31:27.351 --> 00:31:29.840
<v Speaker 2>hitch hitchins defended him publicly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

716
00:31:29.841 --> 00:31:32.420
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know this case free speech.</v>

717
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.373
<v Speaker 2>Trump's so called hate speech because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is who determines what's </v>

718
00:31:36.891 --> 00:31:37.724
<v Speaker 2>hate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hateful.</v>

719
00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And doesn't that hitch defending him?</v>

720
00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:44.780
<v Speaker 1>You debating these people in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing for these terrible ideas.</v>

721
00:31:44.781 --> 00:31:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know the Alec has happened.</v>

722
00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:49.290
<v Speaker 1>This is a terrible idea to deny it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't that show you that,</v>

723
00:31:49.291 --> 00:31:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that the secularists are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently on the right side of things</v>

724
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:59.410
<v Speaker 1>that we are the ones that are defending </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas even when they are scary to us and</v>

725
00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:03.680
<v Speaker 1>things that we don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of people do what most of us,</v>

726
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.250
<v Speaker 1>but people don't know if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's against the religion,</v>

727
00:32:07.251 --> 00:32:11.150
<v Speaker 1>generally religious people aren't going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend you were secularists will,</v>

728
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.410
<v Speaker 1>they'll stand up for the idea.</v>

729
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.353
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm religious do defend free speech </v>

730
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.160
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're willing to allow their,</v>

731
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.840
<v Speaker 2>allow their religion to be criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

732
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.200
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of us sort of circle the wagons and</v>

733
00:32:24.201 --> 00:32:27.980
<v Speaker 2>protect our group or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it takes an extra effort.</v>

734
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.960
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of that type to collectors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

735
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.973
<v Speaker 2>Free speech is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to sort of run through the </v>

736
00:32:33.261 --> 00:32:37.580
<v Speaker 2>arguments that a John Stuart mill made </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his on liberty that,</v>

737
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if they're right?</v>

738
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't be right.</v>

739
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:40.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if they're right?</v>

740
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Just like a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

741
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.980
<v Speaker 2>then you'll learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

742
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 2>and second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

743
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:46.923
<v Speaker 2>a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could learn something from just the </v>

744
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:50.031
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

745
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just how,</v>

746
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:52.543
<v Speaker 2>how confident are you in your arguments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you explain evolution by natural </v>

747
00:32:56.661 --> 00:33:00.440
<v Speaker 2>selection in five minutes in a debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what you gotta do,</v>

748
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.240
<v Speaker 2>opening statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuttal,</v>

749
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 2>rebuttal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuttal q and a boom,</v>

750
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:04.551
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

751
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:05.840
<v Speaker 2>can you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

752
00:33:05.841 --> 00:33:07.970
<v Speaker 2>and when you actually have to do it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

753
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.760
<v Speaker 2>in the case of debating creationist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

754
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I really sharpened my skills about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>do I know that evolution happen?</v>

755
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:17.600
<v Speaker 2>What are the four best arguments we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>

756
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually kind of a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise in that sense.</v>

757
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:20.714
<v Speaker 2>But mostly it's just let this guy talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the whole room can see how idiotic </v>

758
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:28.700
<v Speaker 2>these arguments are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go for it,</v>

759
00:33:28.701 --> 00:33:29.040
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

760
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that a little bit like when the,</v>

761
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.760
<v Speaker 1>who's that creation is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did the ham it when Ken Ham debated Bill</v>

762
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.091
<v Speaker 1>Nye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

763
00:33:36.091 --> 00:33:36.924
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was actually ridiculous and all he </v>

764
00:33:39.511 --> 00:33:43.530
<v Speaker 1>had to do is just let him hang himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're so afraid of doing that.</v>

765
00:33:43.531 --> 00:33:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Are we so afraid of just letting someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>go?</v>

766
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.213
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

767
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.910
<v Speaker 2>it's counterintuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel like we should do,</v>

768
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:52.070
<v Speaker 2>we should circle the wagons and smack </v>
<v Speaker 2>them down.</v>

769
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:52.851
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

770
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:56.270
<v Speaker 2>it's actually better if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just provide better arguments and</v>

771
00:33:56.271 --> 00:33:57.710
<v Speaker 2>let the world see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

772
00:33:57.711 --> 00:33:59.810
<v Speaker 2>how bad those arguments are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>

773
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:04.811
<v Speaker 2>maybe he'll convince a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the long run truth will win out,</v>

774
00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bright light of reason will,</v>

775
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 2>will shine,</v>

776
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.793
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he was just trying to </v>

777
00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 1>sell tickets to that,</v>

778
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.680
<v Speaker 2>the park or whatever that good </v>
<v Speaker 2>intention.</v>

779
00:34:13.681 --> 00:34:16.050
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some fundraising for his arc park,</v>

780
00:34:16.051 --> 00:34:18.930
<v Speaker 2>which I see as going forward today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A boy,</v>

781
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.921
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill,</v>

782
00:34:19.921 --> 00:34:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I know bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill's a good friend and uh,</v>

783
00:34:21.451 --> 00:34:21.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

784
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:24.930
<v Speaker 2>he had some doubts about whether he </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do it or not.</v>

785
00:34:24.931 --> 00:34:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I think in the long run it was a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>

786
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.690
<v Speaker 2>He did a good job</v>

787
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.823
<v Speaker 1>because there's a fear of debating these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people because then you could end up </v>

788
00:34:30.391 --> 00:34:32.360
<v Speaker 1>debating every crackpot ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

789
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.203
<v Speaker 1>Because it was always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we see this is something that I see </v>

790
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.613
<v Speaker 1>every now and again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you argue with someone on </v>

791
00:34:36.901 --> 00:34:37.734
<v Speaker 1>twitter or or some of the other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are arguing with somebody and it's </v>

792
00:34:40.231 --> 00:34:41.041
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

793
00:34:41.041 --> 00:34:43.140
<v Speaker 1>how much energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll do it sometimes too.</v>

794
00:34:43.141 --> 00:34:46.920
<v Speaker 1>How much energy should we put in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>debating people either that have,</v>

795
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:47.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just ideas that are terrible or aren't </v>

796
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.230
<v Speaker 1>debating from an honest place or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

797
00:34:52.231 --> 00:34:53.064
<v Speaker 1>we're going to twist your words after </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a certain opportunity costs </v>

798
00:34:56.071 --> 00:34:56.670
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

799
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.503
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the criteria I use is to </v>

800
00:35:00.451 --> 00:35:03.480
<v Speaker 2>what extent do people care about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject is an influencing thing.</v>

801
00:35:03.481 --> 00:35:04.314
<v Speaker 2>Is it being disgusted the in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political debates at currently or is it </v>

802
00:35:07.321 --> 00:35:11.190
<v Speaker 2>in the newspapers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like in the Holocaust deniers,</v>

803
00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:12.900
<v Speaker 2>back in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a big thing.</v>

804
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.770
<v Speaker 2>They were on a donahue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 2>And Montel Williams and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:21.900
<v Speaker 2>there's articles written about them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and Newsweek and New York Times and</v>

807
00:35:21.901 --> 00:35:24.060
<v Speaker 2>the Schindler's list came out and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>big debates.</v>

808
00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.030
<v Speaker 2>They were challenging it and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles about us.</v>

809
00:35:27.031 --> 00:35:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

810
00:35:28.051 --> 00:35:31.440
<v Speaker 2>It's time for us to engage that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they claiming?</v>

811
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.640
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly?</v>

812
00:35:32.641 --> 00:35:34.440
<v Speaker 2>So they actually gave me this list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>39,</v>

813
00:35:34.441 --> 00:35:35.274
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments that holocaust historians </v>

814
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.820
<v Speaker 2>cannot answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

815
00:35:37.821 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the list.</v>

816
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:39.953
<v Speaker 2>So I actually went down and just worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>my way through the list and a lot of </v>

817
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:43.290
<v Speaker 2>them were hard to find actually.</v>

818
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 2>And went in a lot of his holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 2>historians that I consulted,</v>

819
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 2>they did not know the answers to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

820
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:49.960
<v Speaker 2>And now we know because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

821
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.711
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

822
00:35:50.711 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 2>there's one out and track these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

823
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:53.731
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

824
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Richard Evans did this in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Irving's trial.</v>

825
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:58.150
<v Speaker 2>David Irving sued Deborah Lipstadt for </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling.</v>

826
00:35:58.151 --> 00:36:01.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm a denier now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an interesting sociological thing</v>

827
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 2>because I've always called David Urbina </v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust Denier,</v>

828
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.853
<v Speaker 2>but he likes me because we've gone out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for beer and dinner before and I engage </v>

829
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:10.520
<v Speaker 2>him and I talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>David said,</v>

830
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.750
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with you working on now?</v>

831
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 2>So we had this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he doesn't,</v>

832
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 2>he likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did like Lipstadt because she,</v>

833
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.960
<v Speaker 2>she's nasty tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't talk to him or was it?</v>

834
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

835
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I like to do is as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigator,</v>

836
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.043
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't call it an experiential </v>

837
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Speaker 2>journalists because Sean Penn could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

838
00:36:31.201 --> 00:36:32.034
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sort of get out there and you talk </v>

839
00:36:33.301 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Speaker 2>to people and really they do open up if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're nice and respectful to them,</v>

840
00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:38.400
<v Speaker 2>friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

841
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 2>So just tell me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it you think is going on because</v>

842
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:42.384
<v Speaker 2>I don't really understand the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll kind of open up and </v>

843
00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 2>then if you could give him a few beers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll start talking about,</v>

844
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh the Jews,</v>

845
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 2>the Jews are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

846
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Tell me more.</v>

847
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:57.730
<v Speaker 1>So is that how you ended up sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating him in the public space that you</v>

848
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.823
<v Speaker 1>got to know the guy you were able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of unravel some of the arguments </v>

849
00:37:01.581 --> 00:37:04.070
<v Speaker 1>and I would guess that it's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things where you can just get,</v>

850
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.320
<v Speaker 1>when you pull out one little pin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of it starts to</v>

851
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.820
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say beat,</v>

852
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:11.650
<v Speaker 2>but just you sort of lay it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what he said,</v>

853
00:37:11.651 --> 00:37:13.840
<v Speaker 2>here's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's his arguments and so on,</v>

854
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.400
<v Speaker 2>and it just let the arguments speak for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and I think they do.</v>

855
00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.970
<v Speaker 2>And so those guys are largely gone now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the creationists,</v>

856
00:37:21.971 --> 00:37:22.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still hanging on,</v>

857
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:27.640
<v Speaker 2>the poll numbers are starting to shift </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the whole young Earth creationism is</v>

858
00:37:27.641 --> 00:37:29.840
<v Speaker 2>largely being marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

859
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.250
<v Speaker 2>the Ben Carson's of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

860
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.550
<v Speaker 2>seventh day adventist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're young earth creation.</v>

861
00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.830
<v Speaker 2>This is where all this silliness about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pyramids come from.</v>

862
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:37.143
<v Speaker 2>It's because he's a seventh day </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventist and it follows from these </v>

863
00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:41.830
<v Speaker 2>other beliefs that he holds about </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis and all that.</v>

864
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

865
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.313
<v Speaker 2>but you can see he's not going anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just one and more popular is </v>

866
00:37:46.751 --> 00:37:51.220
<v Speaker 2>either pretty mainstream or really not </v>
<v Speaker 2>very religious centrus like trump.</v>

867
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

868
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.083
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the power of the moral majority </v>

869
00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:58.690
<v Speaker 2>is passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think to get elected you have to</v>

870
00:37:58.691 --> 00:38:00.430
<v Speaker 2>be an uber religious person anymore.</v>

871
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

872
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:02.843
<v Speaker 1>so trump was just at liberty university </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a guy who by any estimation </v>

873
00:38:06.181 --> 00:38:07.014
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has no real religious religious Osetra </v>

874
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:14.470
<v Speaker 1>to him as not even worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was up there and he's like,</v>

875
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:15.763
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was definitely an extra s in </v>

876
00:38:16.381 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's in there.</v>

877
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.500
<v Speaker 1>He's at Liberty University and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>quoting scripture,</v>

878
00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:21.900
<v Speaker 1>wrongly apparently made mocked up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple things,</v>

879
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.063
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking this is really what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with our political system really </v>

880
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:29.850
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the most perfect way because here's a</v>

881
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 1>guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever,</v>

882
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 1>all the reasons that people like him is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's saying things very clearly,</v>

883
00:38:34.561 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 1>whether the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

884
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:36.970
<v Speaker 1>whether it's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just saying.</v>

885
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:38.163
<v Speaker 1>And here even he who says I'm beholden </v>
<v Speaker 1>to no one has to pander still to the </v>

886
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:44.750
<v Speaker 1>religious rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're not fully out of it.</v>

887
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

888
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:46.850
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

889
00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a little bit of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

890
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.480
<v Speaker 2>that's not what's going to win the </v>
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>

891
00:38:50.481 --> 00:38:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be the centrist </v>
<v Speaker 2>votes this time,</v>

892
00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.630
<v Speaker 2>which is more secular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just more real world problems,</v>

893
00:38:56.631 --> 00:38:57.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

894
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:58.243
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

895
00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an inch.</v>

896
00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Another interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

897
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.520
<v Speaker 2>that it seems to be the Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right are the ones identifying,</v>

898
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:05.811
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:39:05.811 --> 00:39:07.250
<v Speaker 2>the problem of terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

900
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.410
<v Speaker 2>what's behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

901
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.520
<v Speaker 2>there's certain religious beliefs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are behind it.</v>

902
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.661
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

903
00:39:11.661 --> 00:39:12.494
<v Speaker 2>I know some of the Isis fighters are </v>
<v Speaker 2>young men out for money and sex and </v>

904
00:39:16.341 --> 00:39:17.900
<v Speaker 2>adventure and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

905
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:19.640
<v Speaker 2>but underneath it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

906
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:24.730
<v Speaker 2>that sort of apocalyptic in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldly Utopian society.</v>

907
00:39:24.981 --> 00:39:25.361
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

908
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:26.194
<v Speaker 2>this kind of really quasi religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs that are driving them and it's </v>

909
00:39:30.291 --> 00:39:31.124
<v Speaker 2>the left that doesn't seem to want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge that they're so afraid of </v>

910
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:33.741
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

911
00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:37.220
<v Speaker 2>political correctness run amok,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so afraid to use the word.</v>

912
00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Our own president won't use the word and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy I admire.</v>

913
00:39:41.631 --> 00:39:42.464
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously very bright and thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's a type two thinker all the </v>

914
00:39:45.771 --> 00:39:48.030
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'd be better if he sometimes use</v>

915
00:39:48.031 --> 00:39:49.010
<v Speaker 2>type one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

916
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:50.343
<v Speaker 1>At least in this instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then he would at least say the </v>

917
00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:53.130
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

918
00:39:53.131 --> 00:39:55.670
<v Speaker 1>this is coming out of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

919
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I do about this?</v>

920
00:39:57.841 --> 00:39:58.674
<v Speaker 1>This has been the theme throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five months that we've been </v>

921
00:40:00.601 --> 00:40:00.910
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>

922
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.743
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

923
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I've watched it and I think you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you have.</v>

924
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:05.453
<v Speaker 2>What we have to do is push back and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just push that pendulum back and if </v>

925
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 2>enough of us do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

926
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:13.510
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it will get knocked back and people</v>

927
00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.344
<v Speaker 2>will stop saying those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll start identifying things </v>

928
00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:17.584
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

929
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think the left is so hung up </v>

930
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:23.400
<v Speaker 1>on this one issue so that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime,</v>

931
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just watching some another program</v>

932
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.860
<v Speaker 1>where after the Cologne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sex attacks,</v>

933
00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:30.694
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand men and there were rapes and </v>

934
00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 1>all this terrible stuff that immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument became,</v>

935
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:36.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Christians do bad stuff to and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West done this and we've bombed this</v>

937
00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:42.004
<v Speaker 1>or that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of knee jerk reaction to make </v>

938
00:40:43.721 --> 00:40:47.470
<v Speaker 1>everything in this moral equivalence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of make everything about us.</v>

939
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Whether when it had it been a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians that had done this,</v>

940
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 1>they never would have flipped it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>

941
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.180
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

942
00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:56.250
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just kept talking about it.</v>

943
00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well a couple things.</v>

944
00:40:57.921 --> 00:40:58.520
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

945
00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.353
<v Speaker 2>Why do they do well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because as Steven pinker points out in </v>

946
00:41:02.241 --> 00:41:05.390
<v Speaker 2>the blank slate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blank slate model that you know,</v>

947
00:41:05.391 --> 00:41:08.210
<v Speaker 2>that culture determines everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise people are equal.</v>

948
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.960
<v Speaker 2>That's more of a left wing and right </v>
<v Speaker 2>wing view of human nature.</v>

949
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Conservative Christians have more of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic,</v>

950
00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Steve Calls a realistic model of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

951
00:41:17.661 --> 00:41:20.780
<v Speaker 2>That is both genetics and culture and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

952
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.450
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

953
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.930
<v Speaker 2>and second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

954
00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.430
<v Speaker 2>that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this all inclusiveness,</v>

955
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.090
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to offend other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because look what w,</v>

956
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:29.933
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were you doing to blacks in the </v>

957
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.940
<v Speaker 2>fifties and sixties and Jews in the and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forties and that was really bad.</v>

958
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of taking a principle and</v>

959
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:37.940
<v Speaker 2>then running with it,</v>

960
00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's denying that that's a fact.</v>

961
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

962
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so therefore it would be wrong to </v>

963
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:44.174
<v Speaker 2>stereotype all Muslims and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it gets to the point where even if </v>

964
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you preface every sentence with,</v>

965
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.463
<v Speaker 2>of course most Muslims are good and nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>and moral people that would never do </v>

966
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:57.020
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you can't even get past that.</v>

967
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:00.290
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what now my wife is from Cologne,</v>

968
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:01.603
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's German and she just moved here </v>

969
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 2>last year and married me and we live </v>
<v Speaker 2>here now.</v>

970
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:05.654
<v Speaker 2>But her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

971
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were going to go to Cologne next </v>

972
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.043
<v Speaker 2>month for carnival and now we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going because she's worried about </v>

973
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.030
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And her mother was just attacked about a</v>

974
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.470
<v Speaker 2>week ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a week after,</v>

975
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.393
<v Speaker 2>two weeks after the new year's thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of this going on </v>

976
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.233
<v Speaker 2>that's not being reported because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid to use the word to say </v>

977
00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:25.923
<v Speaker 2>because her mom was attacked by an Arab </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking Syrian man who said he mumbled </v>

978
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:33.220
<v Speaker 2>something about Western wham and grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 2>her breast and,</v>

979
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.740
<v Speaker 2>and really offensive bottle of booze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

980
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.793
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of these young men that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk and they're sort of using as an </v>

981
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 2>excuse to what extent they're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious.</v>

982
00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

983
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a confluence of a zillion things,</v>

984
00:42:43.231 --> 00:42:45.450
<v Speaker 1>but that's why we have to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

985
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

986
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:46.990
<v Speaker 1>So is that where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

987
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.750
<v Speaker 1>where is that going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

988
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going,</v>

989
00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Angela Merkel,</v>

990
00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:53.660
<v Speaker 2>who I've admired very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe she just went too far.</v>

991
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

992
00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.050
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have to do some screening,</v>

993
00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but the moment you say screening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you.</v>

994
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about targeting certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and,</v>

995
00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:05.070
<v Speaker 2>and isn't that stereotyping and doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lead to genocide?</v>

996
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you ended up down that road,</v>

997
00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.510
<v Speaker 2>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take a little step.</v>

998
00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Just a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a tiny bit to find out what's going</v>

999
00:43:12.831 --> 00:43:13.664
<v Speaker 2>on here before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why trump made that comment and </v>

1000
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:17.040
<v Speaker 2>he's felt a bigot and a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wait,</v>

1001
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 2>he's just saying maybe we should just </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's going on here.</v>

1002
00:43:20.451 --> 00:43:21.090
<v Speaker 2>First.</v>

1003
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:21.923
<v Speaker 1>Clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets twisted into something and I'm </v>

1004
00:43:23.161 --> 00:43:25.080
<v Speaker 1>not defending what he says at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1005
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.123
<v Speaker 1>that's also why language is so important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this because we've gotten so afraid </v>

1006
00:43:28.801 --> 00:43:29.634
<v Speaker 1>of saying anything the wrong way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing anything the wrong way that </v>

1007
00:43:32.101 --> 00:43:34.710
<v Speaker 1>you'll immediately be labeled a bigot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a racist.</v>

1008
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when all you're saying is we should have</v>

1009
00:43:38.371 --> 00:43:40.740
<v Speaker 1>some decent screening to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's here.</v>

1010
00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And you're also giving me a firsthand </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

1011
00:43:42.841 --> 00:43:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife's mother was attached,</v>

1012
00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.440
<v Speaker 1>so this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't made up stuff.</v>

1013
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.370
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

1014
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:48.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cold.</v>

1015
00:43:48.271 --> 00:43:49.104
<v Speaker 2>She's 65 year old woman all bundled up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and umbrella and hat and jacket and </v>

1016
00:43:53.121 --> 00:43:55.800
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not like they're out groping</v>

1017
00:43:55.801 --> 00:43:56.634
<v Speaker 2>young women in bars wearing miniskirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just grabbing anything that's </v>

1018
00:44:00.151 --> 00:44:03.330
<v Speaker 2>female and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so who knows what the motivations are,</v>

1019
00:44:03.331 --> 00:44:04.164
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it again is just young men on </v>

1020
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:07.520
<v Speaker 2>just on a rampage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know.</v>

1021
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:10.590
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not just random who's doing</v>

1022
00:44:10.591 --> 00:44:13.500
<v Speaker 2>it and everybody's afraid to say what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1023
00:44:13.501 --> 00:44:16.200
<v Speaker 2>And so merkel who I think has been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great leader,</v>

1024
00:44:16.201 --> 00:44:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I think she just gone too far.</v>

1025
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the situation?</v>

1026
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:21.914
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't planning on going here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad we were taking this road </v>

1027
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>that Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are saying,</v>

1028
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 1>and I've had a lot of people email me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

1029
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that they're saying that the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they opened the borders the way they did</v>

1030
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 1>was because there's this guilt because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Holocaust,</v>

1031
00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 1>so they don't want to see people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they can help,</v>

1033
00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:37.404
<v Speaker 1>they want to help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's gotten out of control and </v>

1034
00:44:39.211 --> 00:44:42.210
<v Speaker 1>now what this is going to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is help the far right.</v>

1035
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.193
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing hints of this here with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with trump and xenophobia and we're </v>

1036
00:44:45.691 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 1>seeing this all over Europe now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

1037
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 1>it's when the left doesn't deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>things honestly,</v>

1038
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.290
<v Speaker 1>that we allow the</v>

1039
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>

1040
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean if the left wants to defend their</v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

1041
00:44:55.441 --> 00:44:56.274
<v Speaker 2>they should do the opposite what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing because it's the right that are </v>

1042
00:44:58.271 --> 00:44:59.104
<v Speaker 2>going to sweep sweep in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my wife tells me that the sentiments </v>

1043
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:02.334
<v Speaker 2>in Germany about this and before this </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitudes toward Israel and the Middle </v>

1044
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:07.314
<v Speaker 2>Eastern conflicts is that we just have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bite our tongue because what we did </v>

1045
00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:15.510
<v Speaker 2>was so bad that we just have to always </v>
<v Speaker 2>support Israel.</v>

1046
00:45:15.511 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 2>And even though there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's numbers of people in branches,</v>

1047
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.330
<v Speaker 2>in the society that do not support </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel,</v>

1048
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.180
<v Speaker 2>they can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1049
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:25.014
<v Speaker 2>and even though there are debates about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestinians and who's doing what and </v>

1050
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:29.454
<v Speaker 2>who's the real terrorist and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one has perfectly clean hands in </v>

1051
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:34.160
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that conflict.</v>

1052
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in Germany you can't,</v>

1053
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you can't say this because of the guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guilt.</v>

1054
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've had,</v>

1055
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've paid reparations to Israel for a</v>

1056
00:45:43.261 --> 00:45:45.050
<v Speaker 2>long time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1057
00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 2>so Merkel's try to navigate around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to do.</v>

1058
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:51.280
<v Speaker 2>And so in part there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also they're the,</v>

1059
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 2>they're the strongest nation of the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was trying to set a precedence.</v>

1060
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 2>And I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see why she was trying to do that.</v>

1061
00:45:57.541 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 2>But I just think it probably gone too </v>
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>

1062
00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:00.444
<v Speaker 2>And now there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife tells me there's a lot of these </v>

1063
00:46:02.761 --> 00:46:06.750
<v Speaker 2>strong right Nazi type groups that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>now bubbling up saying,</v>

1064
00:46:06.751 --> 00:46:08.180
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you I</v>

1065
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.113
<v Speaker 1>don't do well actually next week I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Robinson on who's the former head </v>

1066
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:14.304
<v Speaker 1>of the edl who marginalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned earlier at one point </v>

1067
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 1>helped get him out of the edl because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt it was too far.</v>

1068
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were some Neo Nazi element and</v>

1069
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.633
<v Speaker 1>he had emailed me about coming on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and I had a real sort of debate </v>

1070
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:31.500
<v Speaker 1>within myself whether here's someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people think he's just a</v>

1071
00:46:31.501 --> 00:46:33.480
<v Speaker 1>racist and then I get a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that say,</v>

1072
00:46:33.481 --> 00:46:34.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1073
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:36.750
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about things that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to talk about.</v>

1074
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:39.000
<v Speaker 1>And I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if I talked to him are people gonna</v>

1075
00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:39.843
<v Speaker 1>think I'm a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that was why I felt like I had </v>

1076
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:43.620
<v Speaker 1>to do the interview and I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

1077
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:45.203
<v Speaker 1>Because I can't be afraid of just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and where that's going to </v>

1078
00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:48.180
<v Speaker 1>replace me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1079
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.600
<v Speaker 1>that's where they've got us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1080
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:50.583
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1081
00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1082
00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:51.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1083
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.160
<v Speaker 2>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have this.</v>

1084
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:54.003
<v Speaker 2>There we are talking about it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will do that and we will push back and </v>

1085
00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:58.580
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1087
00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>

1088
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:04.810
<v Speaker 2>it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Germany and Europe,</v>

1089
00:47:04.811 --> 00:47:07.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've made a major transition from 500</v>

1090
00:47:07.751 --> 00:47:12.751
<v Speaker 2>years of very tribal and balkanized </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly in conflict history to,</v>

1091
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a completely different kind of society.</v>

1092
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.830
<v Speaker 2>And so when these tensions have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubbling up,</v>

1093
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the temptation is to go back and,</v>

1094
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the put,</v>

1095
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.601
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1096
00:47:25.601 --> 00:47:27.090
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to do that because look </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened.</v>

1097
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 2>This led to all these conflicts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genocides and so on.</v>

1098
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.533
<v Speaker 2>But part of the problem is recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there really are bad people in the </v>

1099
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:37.480
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really do mean harm.</v>

1100
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.140
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1101
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:43.120
<v Speaker 2>they really do behead people and they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad things for whatever reason.</v>

1102
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.983
<v Speaker 2>They're not all psychopaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are just morally </v>

1103
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:47.110
<v Speaker 2>motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I mentioned,</v>

1104
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 2>90 percent of the homicides are </v>
<v Speaker 2>moralistic in nature,</v>

1105
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:54.271
<v Speaker 2>but this is true for genocides and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ethnic cleansings and pilgrims.</v>

1106
00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:56.080
<v Speaker 2>They're morally motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1107
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.153
<v Speaker 2>they have wrong ideas and ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous ever have gestated without </v>

1108
00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:05.110
<v Speaker 2>religion because almost all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think,</v>

1109
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holocaust pogroms what's happening right</v>

1110
00:48:07.841 --> 00:48:09.610
<v Speaker 2>now in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>

1111
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a religious underpinning to all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

1112
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:16.360
<v Speaker 2>So could this type of math stuff ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened without religion?</v>

1113
00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:16.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>

1114
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:19.390
<v Speaker 2>It did in the seventies and a 60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

1115
00:48:19.391 --> 00:48:22.900
<v Speaker 2>eighties with Marxist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm regimes and terrorists.</v>

1116
00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:23.734
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of terrorism in the </v>

1117
00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:25.204
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1118
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.210
<v Speaker 2>way more than now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A CNN just ran that.</v>

1119
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.830
<v Speaker 2>They had those series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seventies,</v>

1120
00:48:29.831 --> 00:48:31.930
<v Speaker 2>the eighties and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the one in the seventies,</v>

1121
00:48:31.931 --> 00:48:34.930
<v Speaker 2>one of the episodes was just an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>long of all the terrorist attacks.</v>

1122
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.750
<v Speaker 2>I forgot I lived through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I forgot how many there were.</v>

1123
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.670
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1124
00:48:39.671 --> 00:48:40.504
<v Speaker 2>to the point where Monte Python parody </v>
<v Speaker 2>did in the life of Brian People's Gdl </v>

1125
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:49.530
<v Speaker 2>front the front of people's homes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet that's how many there were.</v>

1126
00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:52.260
<v Speaker 2>But like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a,</v>

1127
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rates of,</v>

1128
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of murders were much higher and bombings</v>

1129
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 2>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States.</v>

1130
00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so those are,</v>

1131
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 2>but those were moralistically driven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1132
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.101
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1133
00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:03.934
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Marxism is sort of a quasi </v>

1134
00:49:05.861 --> 00:49:08.770
<v Speaker 2>religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's behind when we say religion,</v>

1135
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:09.604
<v Speaker 2>it's this idea of a Utopian society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a place we can get to either </v>

1136
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:17.950
<v Speaker 2>heaven above or heavens on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get there if it weren't for those</v>

1137
00:49:17.951 --> 00:49:20.830
<v Speaker 2>people that are stopping us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capitalists,</v>

1138
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.390
<v Speaker 2>the here is the or the Jews or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians or the,</v>

1139
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is.</v>

1140
00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:30.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's engaging the moral module in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

1141
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.570
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is a to be worked up about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cause.</v>

1142
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.430
<v Speaker 2>I love that concept that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always fighting the other,</v>

1143
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:40.264
<v Speaker 2>whoever the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it can be through the religious </v>

1144
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:43.684
<v Speaker 2>prism or the secular prison event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of up to us to figure out </v>

1145
00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.190
<v Speaker 2>which one we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1146
00:49:49.191 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 2>And I'm worried about the EU and Germany</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1147
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been moving in the right </v>

1148
00:49:54.041 --> 00:49:58.180
<v Speaker 2>direction of the very poorest borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can travel across all the countries.</v>

1149
00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.473
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no border checks and it's just </v>

1150
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.250
<v Speaker 2>like driving across the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1151
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:03.911
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1152
00:50:03.911 --> 00:50:04.744
<v Speaker 2>and they've been kind of much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically prosperous because of that </v>

1153
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.090
<v Speaker 2>and politically more freedom and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracies.</v>

1154
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 2>All those things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now there's this,</v>

1155
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fearful,</v>

1156
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:17.080
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Close those borders.</v>

1157
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Balkan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what's happening right now.</v>

1158
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.610
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if they abandoned the currency,</v>

1159
00:50:21.611 --> 00:50:24.280
<v Speaker 2>the euro as a currency a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be bad economically.</v>

1160
00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:25.890
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's move on.</v>

1161
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's move off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics are a little bit.</v>

1162
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.983
<v Speaker 1>Get to some of the sort of more out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there stuff and find stuff because you </v>

1163
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:34.940
<v Speaker 1>do talk a lot about conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1164
00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1165
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:40.130
<v Speaker 1>aliens and JFK assassination and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

1166
00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to debunk this stuff,</v>

1167
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:46.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of fun to think about them.</v>

1168
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1169
00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.010
<v Speaker 1>whether even nine slash 11 thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1170
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:53.180
<v Speaker 1>at least entertaining the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they may be that our government</v>

1171
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 1>did it or this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1172
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of fun to always entertain </v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas.</v>

1173
00:50:57.141 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 1>But basically you come down on all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I think what Carl Sagan would</v>

1174
00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:02.054
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that extraordinary claims require </v>

1175
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

1176
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.670
<v Speaker 1>did I sum up your view on how to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this stuff?</v>

1177
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1178
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.593
<v Speaker 2>The thing with conspiracy theories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are different than other claims that we </v>

1179
00:51:12.991 --> 00:51:16.050
<v Speaker 2>deal with it skeptic is they do happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are conspiracies.</v>

1180
00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:16.913
<v Speaker 2>Watergate was a conspiracy in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination of Lincoln was a </v>

1181
00:51:18.961 --> 00:51:20.430
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:21.241
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1183
00:51:21.241 --> 00:51:22.074
<v Speaker 2>there's all those stories about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that Kissinger was orchestrating </v>

1184
00:51:25.261 --> 00:51:26.094
<v Speaker 2>and South American dictatorships we </v>
<v Speaker 2>liked this dictator versus like we're </v>

1185
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.680
<v Speaker 2>pulling the strings were sending money </v>
<v Speaker 2>arms for hostages,</v>

1186
00:51:31.681 --> 00:51:33.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff was going on.</v>

1187
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Those are conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1188
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1189
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.730
<v Speaker 2>and so we have to acknowledge that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does happen.</v>

1190
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.890
<v Speaker 2>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the to the conspiracy theorist,</v>

1191
00:51:40.891 --> 00:51:43.410
<v Speaker 2>the fact that that happened over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that my pet theory,</v>

1192
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.670
<v Speaker 2>but not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all conspiracies.</v>

1193
00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do we tell the difference?</v>

1194
00:51:49.681 --> 00:51:51.070
<v Speaker 2>What's the criteria?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1195
00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:55.380
<v Speaker 2>that sort of a conspiracy detection kit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Baloney detection kit where you</v>

1196
00:51:55.381 --> 00:51:56.214
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more people that have to be </v>

1197
00:51:56.791 --> 00:51:57.624
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less likely the theory is going to </v>

1198
00:52:00.361 --> 00:52:03.060
<v Speaker 2>be true because people are incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't keep their mouth shut.</v>

1199
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.133
<v Speaker 2>We find out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was on g Gordon Liddy's </v>

1200
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:09.750
<v Speaker 2>radio show back in the nineties and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked me about conspiracies.</v>

1201
00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:10.171
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1202
00:52:10.171 --> 00:52:13.290
<v Speaker 2>you know more about it than I do data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the Watergate guy.</v>

1203
00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you couldn't even break into a hotel</v>

1204
00:52:16.231 --> 00:52:17.064
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1205
00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:18.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have this vision of,</v>

1206
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:19.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government says these super powerful </v>

1207
00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:21.804
<v Speaker 2>agents that can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly they're just like bureaucrats at </v>

1208
00:52:24.301 --> 00:52:26.190
<v Speaker 2>the DMV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're dealing with.</v>

1209
00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:27.123
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a way it's the same thing as </v>

1210
00:52:28.091 --> 00:52:28.924
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are going down the </v>

1211
00:52:29.741 --> 00:52:30.574
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want some easy answer for an </v>

1212
00:52:33.461 --> 00:52:37.580
<v Speaker 1>extremely complex issue that we really </v>
<v Speaker 1>often have no answer</v>

1213
00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:39.123
<v Speaker 2>enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not this complex system that no one can </v>

1214
00:52:40.451 --> 00:52:41.830
<v Speaker 2>really understand or predict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1215
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.520
<v Speaker 2>it's 12 guys living in London calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shots of the Illuminati.</v>

1216
00:52:45.521 --> 00:52:47.890
<v Speaker 2>And they're pulling the strings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>making this happen.</v>

1217
00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>So it is the same thing as religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that feels nice if you,</v>

1218
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.680
<v Speaker 1>if you could sort of wrap yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that,</v>

1219
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:55.510
<v Speaker 1>that that's how the world actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>operates.</v>

1220
00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.490
<v Speaker 1>We'd sorted the same thing as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1221
00:52:57.491 --> 00:52:59.380
<v Speaker 1>well there's a god and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that</v>

1222
00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:00.483
<v Speaker 2>it is like a god or committee of gods or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's pulling the strings in </v>

1223
00:53:03.571 --> 00:53:05.660
<v Speaker 2>it and it grants way more power than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1224
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:09.190
<v Speaker 2>than anybody actually has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we grant to gods that they</v>

1225
00:53:09.191 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 2>have more power than we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise they wouldn't be gods,</v>

1226
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.480
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the point of that?</v>

1227
00:53:13.481 --> 00:53:15.130
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1228
00:53:15.131 --> 00:53:15.964
<v Speaker 2>we worked through those and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically since we've talked about </v>

1229
00:53:17.381 --> 00:53:18.214
<v Speaker 2>left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nine slash 11 is an interesting </v>

1230
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.840
<v Speaker 2>take because that seems to be more on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>

1231
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:23.703
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and left and right both have their </v>

1232
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 2>handpicked conspiracies that they prefer</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1233
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:29.520
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1234
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 2>but the anti-vaxxers tend to be a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of both.</v>

1235
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:32.933
<v Speaker 2>You get antigovernment right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the thing that the government </v>

1236
00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:39.880
<v Speaker 2>is in cahoots with big Pharma and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>

1237
00:53:39.881 --> 00:53:40.714
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big Pharma is making money off of </v>

1238
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get a little bit of both,</v>

1239
00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.673
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1240
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.513
<v Speaker 1>Someone like Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's anti-vaxxer for the most </v>

1241
00:53:46.841 --> 00:53:48.520
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's firmly on the left,</v>

1242
00:53:48.521 --> 00:53:49.090
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1243
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:49.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1244
00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:50.480
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1245
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:55.420
<v Speaker 2>it's skeptical skepticism of authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which Authority are you skeptical of the</v>

1246
00:53:55.421 --> 00:53:56.590
<v Speaker 2>government or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1247
00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.513
<v Speaker 2>or the corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the perception is both have these </v>

1248
00:54:00.101 --> 00:54:02.950
<v Speaker 2>incredible amounts of power and studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this show.</v>

1249
00:54:02.951 --> 00:54:05.470
<v Speaker 2>They really don't have as much power as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we think that they do.</v>

1250
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ceos come and go and,</v>

1251
00:54:07.841 --> 00:54:11.050
<v Speaker 2>and corporations rise and fall much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than we think that they do.</v>

1252
00:54:11.051 --> 00:54:12.000
<v Speaker 2>We think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1253
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:13.930
<v Speaker 2>the microsofts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1254
00:54:13.931 --> 00:54:16.000
<v Speaker 2>even Google Apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will fail.</v>

1255
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:17.150
<v Speaker 2>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1256
00:54:17.151 --> 00:54:21.190
<v Speaker 2>they're on top now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this will change just like Ibm,</v>

1257
00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:22.480
<v Speaker 2>General Motors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1258
00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1259
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:25.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so open.</v>

1260
00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I was in Berkeley last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1261
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:31.600
<v Speaker 2>that promoting the skeptic book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did talk for a KPFA PACIFICA radio,</v>

1262
00:54:31.601 --> 00:54:34.570
<v Speaker 2>which is very far left progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1263
00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:37.510
<v Speaker 2>so it was that this church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of wild because big cross</v>

1264
00:54:37.511 --> 00:54:39.730
<v Speaker 2>behind me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1265
00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but there were protesters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I protesters.</v>

1266
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this about,</v>

1267
00:54:43.241 --> 00:54:44.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're handing out literature,</v>

1268
00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:45.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the engineers and architects for nine </v>

1269
00:54:47.171 --> 00:54:50.380
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 truth and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shermer versus reality.</v>

1270
00:54:50.381 --> 00:54:52.380
<v Speaker 2>The building seven could not have color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1271
00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you tweet about this.</v>

1272
00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:55.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:54:55.211 --> 00:54:56.680
<v Speaker 2>So they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a.</v>

1274
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:57.833
<v Speaker 2>So this is that the government is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling the strings and doing these </v>

1275
00:55:01.871 --> 00:55:02.704
<v Speaker 2>things because of oil and the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's after the fact reason he's </v>

1276
00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:06.710
<v Speaker 2>hindsight by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we went to war.</v>

1277
00:55:06.711 --> 00:55:07.660
<v Speaker 2>It was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad idea,</v>

1278
00:55:07.661 --> 00:55:11.350
<v Speaker 2>but we did it for oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore we must have triggered the war</v>

1279
00:55:11.351 --> 00:55:13.660
<v Speaker 2>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't governments don't.</v>

1280
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.643
<v Speaker 2>Conservative and Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrations do those sorts of </v>

1281
00:55:16.481 --> 00:55:17.650
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1282
00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:20.140
<v Speaker 2>So do democratic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1283
00:55:20.141 --> 00:55:20.974
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt could not get America into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>war to help churchill who he wanted to </v>

1284
00:55:24.431 --> 00:55:28.870
<v Speaker 2>help because of the American firsters </v>
<v Speaker 2>were very powerful in the late thirties.</v>

1285
00:55:28.871 --> 00:55:32.590
<v Speaker 2>And they could all see the Nazis rising </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Roosevelt and Churchill wanted to do</v>

1286
00:55:32.591 --> 00:55:35.350
<v Speaker 2>something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1287
00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.213
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charles Lindbergh and the American </v>

1288
00:55:37.211 --> 00:55:40.790
<v Speaker 2>firsters were very powerful Pearl Harbor</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a story we're going to reward.</v>

1289
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.063
<v Speaker 2>So isn't that an example of using an </v>
<v Speaker 2>event that you didn't orchestrate to do </v>

1290
00:55:46.601 --> 00:55:47.900
<v Speaker 2>something politically you want to do?</v>

1291
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:49.763
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a nice conspiracy theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they knew it was going to happen </v>

1292
00:55:52.251 --> 00:55:53.240
<v Speaker 1>and they allowed it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1293
00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.120
<v Speaker 2>So there was two conspiracies about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and same nine slash 11.</v>

1294
00:55:56.121 --> 00:55:56.954
<v Speaker 2>Either either they did it or they knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>it would happen in allowed it to happen </v>

1295
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:04.700
<v Speaker 2>in order to get this political mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so neither of them are true.</v>

1296
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:07.640
<v Speaker 2>And the reason we know this is because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1297
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.680
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence that's used in favor of the</v>

1298
00:56:09.681 --> 00:56:13.040
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy is all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all along is hindsight bias is that,</v>

1299
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1300
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.740
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this memo here.</v>

1301
00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:16.803
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous August ninth memo from </v>

1302
00:56:18.231 --> 00:56:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Condoleeza Rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1303
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Sama bid line will attack on US soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1304
00:56:22.161 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 2>How come Bush didn't do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there is 10,000</v>

1305
00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:26.194
<v Speaker 2>pieces of info like that every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're sorting through it and </v>

1306
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 2>no one's talking to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:31.390
<v Speaker 2>it's just chaos.</v>

1308
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:32.303
<v Speaker 1>So are you ever able to debunk a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory to a point where the </v>

1309
00:56:37.321 --> 00:56:41.310
<v Speaker 1>theorists themselves will concede it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's sort of the fun in it.</v>

1310
00:56:41.311 --> 00:56:42.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1311
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So even if you lay down something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just ironclad,</v>

1312
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.353
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to find some way to get </v>

1313
00:56:50.101 --> 00:56:51.150
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1314
00:56:51.151 --> 00:56:52.840
<v Speaker 1>how often do you win in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1315
00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:53.500
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>

1316
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.333
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1317
00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.670
<v Speaker 2>to the people that I'm debating or </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to probably never,</v>

1318
00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.610
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're after is again,</v>

1319
00:56:59.611 --> 00:57:01.830
<v Speaker 2>the undecided voters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that are like,</v>

1320
00:57:01.831 --> 00:57:03.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the story with that?</v>

1321
00:57:03.151 --> 00:57:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I heard something about that memo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1322
00:57:05.551 --> 00:57:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they.</v>

1323
00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>

1324
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to that.</v>

1325
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:12.660
<v Speaker 2>And you try to influence them by just </v>
<v Speaker 2>some basic questions.</v>

1326
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:12.961
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1327
00:57:12.961 --> 00:57:16.320
<v Speaker 2>I rifled through all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other things that,</v>

1328
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic terrorists have done,</v>

1329
00:57:18.331 --> 00:57:22.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>London and Madrid and Boston and African</v>

1330
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:23.064
<v Speaker 2>countries and so on and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they also part of this vast right </v>

1331
00:57:26.911 --> 00:57:28.630
<v Speaker 2>wing conspiracy that the bush?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1332
00:57:28.631 --> 00:57:29.161
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1333
00:57:29.161 --> 00:57:30.990
<v Speaker 2>of course not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that particular one,</v>

1334
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.940
<v Speaker 2>which is a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1335
00:57:32.941 --> 00:57:35.790
<v Speaker 2>we know those crop circles were faked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ones over here,</v>

1336
00:57:35.791 --> 00:57:37.740
<v Speaker 2>we don't have videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the real ones.</v>

1337
00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:39.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also seems to be a need to </v>

1338
00:57:41.361 --> 00:57:44.000
<v Speaker 1>explain things that can't easily be </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained.</v>

1339
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:47.420
<v Speaker 1>So even going back to the Cologne thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that day,</v>

1340
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:48.543
<v Speaker 1>a fairly well known feminist saying this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was probably the work of </v>

1341
00:57:52.401 --> 00:57:55.280
<v Speaker 1>anti-immigration people that allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

1342
00:57:55.281 --> 00:57:56.114
<v Speaker 1>that allowed this open because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to really deal with the </v>

1343
00:57:58.371 --> 00:57:59.204
<v Speaker 1>world as it was and deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult questions related to </v>

1344
00:58:01.161 --> 00:58:04.400
<v Speaker 1>immigration and race and religion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>

1345
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.353
<v Speaker 1>So instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of use it for your own </v>

1346
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.233
<v Speaker 1>purposes and then you just open up </v>
<v Speaker 1>another conspiracy theory and then that </v>

1347
00:58:11.271 --> 00:58:14.060
<v Speaker 1>gets retweeted enough and then you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened up a whole other.</v>

1348
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that case it's okay to just call </v>

1349
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.110
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

1350
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:17.611
<v Speaker 1>Just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1351
00:58:17.611 --> 00:58:20.040
<v Speaker 1>that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a bridge too far.</v>

1352
00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:20.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do a little more on politics </v>

1353
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:22.950
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you consider yourself</v>

1354
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:24.060
<v Speaker 2>a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

1355
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more of an issues guy,</v>

1356
00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:30.320
<v Speaker 2>but I've leaned libertarian most of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life since college and uh,</v>

1357
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:31.373
<v Speaker 2>but I've changed my mind in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that libertarians are not too </v>

1358
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.550
<v Speaker 2>happy about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

1359
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:39.590
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I'm avoid using the term </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much now a is because um,</v>

1360
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:42.493
<v Speaker 2>it pigeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it pigeonholes you into a category in </v>

1361
00:58:44.611 --> 00:58:46.620
<v Speaker 2>which you're in and then it makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>more like a religion.</v>

1362
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:47.521
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1363
00:58:47.521 --> 00:58:48.354
<v Speaker 2>so libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't believe in any gun </v>

1364
00:58:50.101 --> 00:58:50.791
<v Speaker 2>controls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1365
00:58:50.791 --> 00:58:51.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1366
00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:53.370
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I think maybe background checks</v>

1367
00:58:53.371 --> 00:58:57.030
<v Speaker 2>are a good idea in the magazine clip </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be a certain,</v>

1368
00:58:57.031 --> 00:58:58.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a few things,</v>

1369
00:58:58.531 --> 00:59:00.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you've abandoned us,</v>

1370
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:03.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what do we have tried,</v>

1371
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1372
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:05.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like a ride or you're Republican in</v>
<v Speaker 1>name only.</v>

1373
00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:06.131
<v Speaker 1>You're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1374
00:59:06.131 --> 00:59:07.000
<v Speaker 1>a line or something.</v>

1375
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1376
00:59:07.861 --> 00:59:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the,</v>

1377
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.073
<v Speaker 2>these are the points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to hold to all of them or else </v>

1378
00:59:11.521 --> 00:59:13.110
<v Speaker 2>you're not in our tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1379
00:59:13.111 --> 00:59:13.944
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I don't want to be in the </v>

1380
00:59:14.431 --> 00:59:16.380
<v Speaker 2>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I just want to look at issues.</v>

1381
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:17.263
<v Speaker 2>And what I like about Libertarians is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like either the far right or far </v>

1382
00:59:20.371 --> 00:59:23.000
<v Speaker 2>left and so sort of pushes toward the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of the middle.</v>

1383
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.983
<v Speaker 2>I guess the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with the spectrum is that </v>

1384
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not really a spectrum like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1385
00:59:27.921 --> 00:59:32.050
<v Speaker 2>there's other places you could be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a peer,</v>

1386
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.750
<v Speaker 2>a diamond shaped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1387
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.370
<v Speaker 2>but nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1388
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Speaker 2>that and things like climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1389
00:59:37.341 --> 00:59:41.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're supposed to be against a</v>
<v Speaker 2>believer in climate change because we're</v>

1390
00:59:41.091 --> 00:59:42.170
<v Speaker 2>pro capitalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1391
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either it's getting warmer,</v>

1392
00:59:44.061 --> 00:59:46.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just an empirical question.</v>

1393
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:47.420
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with politics.</v>

1394
00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that show you?</v>

1395
00:59:48.711 --> 00:59:49.544
<v Speaker 1>That's a good example of how politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>and religion and just rationality and </v>

1396
00:59:54.951 --> 00:59:59.150
<v Speaker 1>irrationally it all gets mucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hear you because a lot of people,</v>

1397
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always considered myself a liberal </v>

1398
01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:02.443
<v Speaker 1>and now I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get emails and tweets everyday people </v>

1399
01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:04.850
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1400
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:05.683
<v Speaker 1>Dave's on his way to becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian because I will always stand </v>

1401
01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:09.194
<v Speaker 1>up for liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that the individual </v>

1402
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:12.410
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately,</v>

1403
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I think you could know for gay marriage </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1404
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>while I can defend it from a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view,</v>

1405
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>because I think people should be allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to marry who they want.</v>

1406
01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>It's also very easily defended by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian point of view,</v>

1407
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

1408
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>or medical marijuana or things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1409
01:00:26.961 --> 01:00:27.794
<v Speaker 1>So that's a place where I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think classic liberals and </v>

1410
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians can sort of come together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that that concept is sort</v>

1411
01:00:34.401 --> 01:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>of where politics should go in general.</v>

1412
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1413
01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Dr King made the point about gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage back when people were saying,</v>

1414
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:42.974
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't get involved in that back </v>

1415
01:00:43.651 --> 01:00:44.610
<v Speaker 2>in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1416
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:46.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a.</v>

1417
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.280
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1418
01:00:47.281 --> 01:00:49.260
<v Speaker 2>our freedom is wrapped up in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>

1419
01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:50.123
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can suppress somebody because of </v>

1420
01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.073
<v Speaker 2>this particular way that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can suppress them for other </v>

1421
01:00:54.091 --> 01:00:56.340
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want freedom across the board.</v>

1422
01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:58.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the principle.</v>

1423
01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that idea though a really what's </v>

1424
01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:01.824
<v Speaker 1>so dangerous about identity politics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not what Dr King said that </v>

1425
01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>we have to protect everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually identity politics,</v>

1426
01:01:08.881 --> 01:01:09.714
<v Speaker 1>like we got to protect ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is everyone else </v>

1427
01:01:12.841 --> 01:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>is sort of secondary.</v>

1428
01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1429
01:01:16.351 --> 01:01:17.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is our tribe.</v>

1430
01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:20.400
<v Speaker 2>These are what the things we believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even like the humanism,</v>

1431
01:01:20.401 --> 01:01:22.410
<v Speaker 2>when I got involved in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptics movement,</v>

1432
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:23.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late eighties,</v>

1433
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:24.960
<v Speaker 2>early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

1434
01:01:24.961 --> 01:01:25.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a humanist.</v>

1435
01:01:25.801 --> 01:01:26.421
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1436
01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:27.254
<v Speaker 2>I started reading the humanist magazines</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going to their conferences and </v>

1437
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.333
<v Speaker 2>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could clearly see they had a list </v>

1438
01:01:32.011 --> 01:01:35.910
<v Speaker 2>of talking points that were just clearly</v>
<v Speaker 2>right down the straight political left.</v>

1439
01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:36.811
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1440
01:01:36.811 --> 01:01:38.400
<v Speaker 2>what about these things over here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1441
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the evil Republicans.</v>

1442
01:01:40.351 --> 01:01:41.184
<v Speaker 2>Evil Conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1443
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:42.023
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

1444
01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.193
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were a humanist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just science reason you stay out of </v>

1445
01:01:46.021 --> 01:01:48.900
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1446
01:01:48.901 --> 01:01:50.310
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're political animals.</v>

1447
01:01:50.311 --> 01:01:52.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just want to be tribal.</v>

1448
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:54.630
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know libertarians,</v>

1449
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like hurting cats.</v>

1450
01:01:55.831 --> 01:01:58.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're never going to be a big party.</v>

1451
01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:00.540
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not even sure if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile label.</v>

1452
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to figure out a way to sort of </v>

1453
01:02:03.441 --> 01:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>get those principles out there more even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though I don't as you know,</v>

1454
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>as I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need the label for myself,</v>

1455
01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>but I think you can make a lot of strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral arguments.</v>

1456
01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Not using religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1457
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Through the Libertarian Lens</v>

1458
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:16.750
<v Speaker 2>language matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1459
01:02:16.751 --> 01:02:17.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're in,</v>

1460
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.700
<v Speaker 2>we were in favor of liberty and aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in favor of liberty and freedom?</v>

1461
01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds good.</v>

1462
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:24.600
<v Speaker 2>We're trying a new one on instead of gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

1463
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Gun Safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in gun safety.</v>

1464
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I think people should be trained if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a gun,</v>

1465
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:31.620
<v Speaker 2>I think they should keep their gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>locked up safely.</v>

1466
01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Don't you agree?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1467
01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.410
<v Speaker 2>anyone in the NRA should go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1468
01:02:34.411 --> 01:02:35.041
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1469
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 2>That's what our organization is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gun Safety.</v>

1470
01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.154
<v Speaker 2>That's why they were founded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but control it makes it sound like </v>

1471
01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:44.190
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to control my freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to control my individuality</v>

1472
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:46.110
<v Speaker 2>and that feels wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1473
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:49.590
<v Speaker 2>So the language does matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think how we use these things.</v>

1474
01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1475
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:50.663
<v Speaker 1>so the kind of arguments kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because I think there is a </v>

1476
01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>certain element of conspiracy theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the people,</v>

1477
01:02:56.881 --> 01:02:57.714
<v Speaker 1>the people that are totally pro gun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point that you should be allowed to </v>

1478
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:03.570
<v Speaker 1>have whatever it is you want and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one day you're gonna have to rise up and</v>

1479
01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:05.790
<v Speaker 1>fight the government and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>

1480
01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:06.624
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sat on the show many times like I </v>

1481
01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:08.214
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We left England because we didn't want </v>

1482
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:13.730
<v Speaker 1>to live under a king and a tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and no tax agent was an agent</v>

1483
01:03:13.731 --> 01:03:15.810
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1484
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.140
<v Speaker 1>but there's an element of conspiracy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1485
01:03:18.141 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>that the government is coming to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>

1486
01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more that the government tries to</v>

1487
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 1>get their guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more they want their guns,</v>

1488
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So isn't that because Lee cycle,</v>

1489
01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:29.443
<v Speaker 1>how do we break that?</v>

1490
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Obama has sold more guns.</v>

1491
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that constantly,</v>

1492
01:03:33.111 --> 01:03:34.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do,</v>

1493
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.300
<v Speaker 1>how do we break that cycle?</v>

1494
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think,</v>

1495
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to get to organizations </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the NRA and say,</v>

1496
01:03:40.281 --> 01:03:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've gone down the wrong path.</v>

1497
01:03:42.381 --> 01:03:43.214
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really should be in favor of safety </v>

1498
01:03:44.091 --> 01:03:47.360
<v Speaker 2>and these are the kinds of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to have background checks.</v>

1499
01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just change the conversation.</v>

1500
01:03:49.191 --> 01:03:50.024
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're in favor of a terrorist </v>

1501
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.690
<v Speaker 2>getting guns for free and killing people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

1502
01:03:53.691 --> 01:03:55.010
<v Speaker 2>You think that that should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1503
01:03:55.011 --> 01:03:55.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1504
01:03:55.401 --> 01:03:56.240
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be to.</v>

1505
01:03:56.241 --> 01:03:57.074
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you tell if they're a terrorist </v>

1506
01:03:57.951 --> 01:03:58.784
<v Speaker 2>or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we just have to have background </v>

1507
01:03:59.391 --> 01:04:00.224
<v Speaker 2>checks for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to tell you at the </v>

1508
01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:01.940
<v Speaker 2>border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1509
01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming here to kill Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1510
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:04.910
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1511
01:04:04.911 --> 01:04:06.890
<v Speaker 2>you need the general principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what about,</v>

1512
01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>air let anybody fly.</v>

1513
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:09.381
<v Speaker 2>Airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>

1514
01:04:09.381 --> 01:04:10.460
<v Speaker 2>they should be licensed.</v>

1515
01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Of course they should be licensed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I try,</v>

1516
01:04:12.551 --> 01:04:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I try to use those arguments and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>take the approach like I do with,</v>

1517
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.300
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians.</v>

1518
01:04:17.301 --> 01:04:18.134
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be one now used to be a </v>

1519
01:04:18.861 --> 01:04:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are a Christian.</v>

1520
01:04:19.761 --> 01:04:20.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

1521
01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then at least they're listening.</v>

1522
01:04:22.431 --> 01:04:24.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be against all gun control.</v>

1523
01:04:24.411 --> 01:04:25.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had guns,</v>

1524
01:04:25.341 --> 01:04:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I grew up with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

1525
01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I had a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1526
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.010
<v Speaker 2>a handgun in my home for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1527
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:32.930
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to change your mind.</v>

1528
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:34.063
<v Speaker 2>You change your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started reading and thinking about it </v>

1529
01:04:35.331 --> 01:04:38.870
<v Speaker 2>and look at these studies and so on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so to open the door to a conversation,</v>

1530
01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.213
<v Speaker 2>but guns are almost tell asthmatic now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're almost like religious icons of </v>

1531
01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.230
<v Speaker 2>representing freedom and liberty and God</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jesus and I don't know,</v>

1532
01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:49.183
<v Speaker 2>it's all wrapped up in a package now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people just lose their minds when </v>

1533
01:04:52.551 --> 01:04:53.384
<v Speaker 2>you talk about it.</v>

1534
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.233
<v Speaker 1>So as long as we're talking guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's knock out a couple other just hot </v>

1535
01:04:56.731 --> 01:04:57.564
<v Speaker 1>button political things and see if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can figure out the moral argument for </v>

1536
01:04:59.971 --> 01:05:02.850
<v Speaker 1>them before we wrap up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something like abortion,</v>

1537
01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:03.953
<v Speaker 1>which as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm for the woman being able to make </v>

1538
01:05:06.631 --> 01:05:10.170
<v Speaker 1>decisions about her body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same point I would understand</v>

1539
01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:11.004
<v Speaker 1>that having an abortion at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at eight months or seven months or even </v>

1540
01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>six months in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are definitely destroying a human life.</v>

1541
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.353
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your people don't want to have that </v>

1542
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:22.594
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1543
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>people are afraid to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

1544
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what moral argument can you make that is</v>

1545
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume you're,</v>

1546
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing you're for abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I don't have.</v>

1547
01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:35.150
<v Speaker 1>So your approach is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's one piece of a.</v>

1548
01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.173
<v Speaker 1>that's why language matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what moral argument can you make </v>

1549
01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:39.484
<v Speaker 1>that for abortion that also understands </v>
<v Speaker 1>that at some point before that thing </v>

1550
01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>leaves the woman's body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a life at the same point.</v>

1551
01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:48.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the law is tracked this fairly </v>

1552
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:52.340
<v Speaker 2>closely to our intuitions that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1553
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.970
<v Speaker 2>a third trimester abortion is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:56.893
<v Speaker 2>the gray area in the second trimester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Gregory and the first trimester kind </v>

1555
01:06:00.741 --> 01:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>of tracking our sense about whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>an individual or not,</v>

1556
01:06:04.011 --> 01:06:09.011
<v Speaker 2>is that a person that's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognizant can feel and suffer.</v>

1557
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there,</v>

1558
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I think you could make the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to,</v>

1559
01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.690
<v Speaker 2>in the moral arc that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1560
01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:16.643
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the freedom of adult women to have </v>

1561
01:06:19.131 --> 01:06:19.964
<v Speaker 2>control and choice over their own bodies</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly trumps the rights or whatever </v>

1562
01:06:26.181 --> 01:06:28.600
<v Speaker 2>of the fetus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just barely a,</v>

1563
01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.513
<v Speaker 2>I'm not pro abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am pro choice and it would be better </v>

1564
01:06:31.971 --> 01:06:34.070
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the numbers got down,</v>

1565
01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.293
<v Speaker 2>but if a but on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's our goal to decrease the number </v>

1566
01:06:37.521 --> 01:06:38.354
<v Speaker 2>of abortions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best thing you can do is get women </v>

1567
01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.610
<v Speaker 2>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperous,</v>

1568
01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:47.420
<v Speaker 2>and access to birth control and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers just go down.</v>

1569
01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.313
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we really failed as a </v>

1570
01:06:49.771 --> 01:06:50.610
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1571
01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the same people that don't want </v>

1572
01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:55.620
<v Speaker 1>abortions also cut sex education and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's like,</v>

1573
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:56.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1574
01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:57.143
<v Speaker 1>and then they cut social services so </v>
<v Speaker 1>people feel like if they're going to </v>

1575
01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:02.550
<v Speaker 1>have a kid and not have money for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they don't want that kid.</v>

1576
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1577
01:07:03.781 --> 01:07:05.680
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of these never ending </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycles.</v>

1578
01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.613
<v Speaker 2>And the other argument I make in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral arc is it historical and that has </v>

1579
01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.360
<v Speaker 2>historically men have always lorded it </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

1580
01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:16.361
<v Speaker 2>Women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly about sex and paternity and</v>

1581
01:07:16.431 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>

1582
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:18.583
<v Speaker 2>if you just look at the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage and the history of men and </v>

1583
01:07:21.591 --> 01:07:23.750
<v Speaker 2>women's relationships for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1584
01:07:23.751 --> 01:07:24.584
<v Speaker 2>it's always men trying to control women </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's good evolutionary reasons </v>

1585
01:07:27.771 --> 01:07:29.510
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinker argues about this in,</v>

1586
01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.800
<v Speaker 2>in the blank slate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1587
01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:33.620
<v Speaker 2>whole chapter on sex and all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1588
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:38.120
<v Speaker 2>men are obsessed with controlling </v>
<v Speaker 2>women's sexuality and this is one of the</v>

1589
01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:40.790
<v Speaker 2>big things that have helped the women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement is to,</v>

1590
01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:44.600
<v Speaker 2>is to break that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those chains and give women the freedom.</v>

1591
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.733
<v Speaker 2>So that's my final argument is that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>addition to the rights of the fetus </v>

1592
01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.960
<v Speaker 2>selling all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1593
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.823
<v Speaker 2>but just in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better to give women more freedom </v>

1594
01:07:54.261 --> 01:07:58.400
<v Speaker 2>than less end to end to keep men out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that area of control.</v>

1595
01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that sounds like it would line up </v>

1596
01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:02.650
<v Speaker 1>with some libertarian values pointedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1597
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.540
<v Speaker 1>The liberty of the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1598
01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>So most libertarians are pro choice for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1599
01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>So there's a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ron Paul,</v>

1600
01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>who was sort of considered himself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>

1601
01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:12.980
<v Speaker 1>but he's Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So see there,</v>

1602
01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you see that interesting conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was a gynecologist,</v>

1603
01:08:15.871 --> 01:08:16.950
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he is a guy in the bottom.</v>

1604
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.770
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1605
01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:18.603
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot,</v>

1606
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:22.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1607
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.180
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians are all over the board,</v>

1608
01:08:24.181 --> 01:08:24.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1609
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.433
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of atheist libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's plenty of believers or are </v>

1610
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.210
<v Speaker 2>just in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not religious at all.</v>

1611
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:31.463
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're also very much split on </v>

1612
01:08:32.551 --> 01:08:34.110
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1613
01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:37.890
<v Speaker 2>should we be isolationists or do we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go help people that need help,</v>

1614
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:38.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1615
01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Rand Paul,</v>

1616
01:08:40.121 --> 01:08:42.180
<v Speaker 2>he was very isolationist his father even</v>
<v Speaker 2>more so.</v>

1617
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1618
01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.220
<v Speaker 2>I get those arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1619
01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:48.180
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't we have a moral obligation to help</v>

1620
01:08:48.181 --> 01:08:49.014
<v Speaker 2>people whose own freedoms and liberties </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being oppressed by a tyrannical </v>

1621
01:08:52.351 --> 01:08:53.490
<v Speaker 2>dictators?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1622
01:08:53.491 --> 01:08:54.180
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>

1623
01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:54.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1624
01:08:54.841 --> 01:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>So this is what that split in the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about earlier.</v>

1625
01:08:57.511 --> 01:08:58.344
<v Speaker 1>It's really a hugely about what can we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do and are we imposing our values and </v>

1626
01:09:01.591 --> 01:09:02.031
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let,</v>

1627
01:09:02.031 --> 01:09:02.864
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do one more and then we got </v>

1628
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>to wrap up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk about a moral argument</v>

1629
01:09:05.881 --> 01:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>you can make on the economic level I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is really interesting.</v>

1630
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:10.231
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1631
01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:11.064
<v Speaker 1>when you hear people talking about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie wants to tax everybody at 90 </v>

1632
01:09:13.291 --> 01:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know it's not 90 percent.</v>

1633
01:09:14.731 --> 01:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a progressive tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not,</v>

1634
01:09:16.621 --> 01:09:17.454
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without getting into too much into the </v>

1635
01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:19.373
<v Speaker 1>numbers there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really taxing you at 90 </v>

1636
01:09:20.911 --> 01:09:24.750
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It progressively increases versus a flat</v>

1637
01:09:24.751 --> 01:09:25.584
<v Speaker 1>tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you make a moral argument for </v>

1638
01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>economics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense?</v>

1639
01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.133
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure absolutely across the </v>

1640
01:09:33.311 --> 01:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1641
01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:38.020
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of running different </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments were say different states in</v>

1642
01:09:38.021 --> 01:09:38.854
<v Speaker 2>the 50 states have different tax systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can kind of look at the outcome </v>

1643
01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:46.300
<v Speaker 2>of what happens socially in that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically in that particular state.</v>

1644
01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.613
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it become more or less prosperous </v>

1645
01:09:48.521 --> 01:09:50.800
<v Speaker 2>with the progressive tax versus a flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax?</v>

1646
01:09:50.801 --> 01:09:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I would actually like to see some states</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do a straight flat tax and just see</v>

1647
01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:56.860
<v Speaker 2>what happens or maybe try it for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1648
01:09:56.861 --> 01:10:00.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe we should abolish the irs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with straight 16 and a half percent,</v>

1649
01:10:00.161 --> 01:10:02.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the cruise wants that.</v>

1650
01:10:02.891 --> 01:10:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's see what happens,</v>

1651
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run the experiment and we can always go </v>

1652
01:10:06.941 --> 01:10:08.380
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1653
01:10:08.381 --> 01:10:10.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm in favor of just trying different</v>

1654
01:10:10.241 --> 01:10:11.980
<v Speaker 2>things on a lot of those things.</v>

1655
01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that there's an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>single answer here.</v>

1656
01:10:15.851 --> 01:10:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I like Sam's a metaphor of the multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaks on the moral landscape.</v>

1657
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do we decide which peak is right?</v>

1658
01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.200
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no,</v>

1659
01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:24.123
<v Speaker 2>there's no right peak is right for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is kind of the libertarian </v>

1660
01:10:26.651 --> 01:10:27.340
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1661
01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.470
<v Speaker 2>you want to paint your house red with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>purple door,</v>

1662
01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.393
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in our neighborhood we don't like </v>

1663
01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:35.680
<v Speaker 2>the houses that look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all look the same.</v>

1664
01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:36.514
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we like in this </v>

1665
01:10:37.061 --> 01:10:39.490
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that neighborhood over there make it</v>

1666
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.000
<v Speaker 2>topanga where everybody has these wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>hippie homes.</v>

1667
01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:43.834
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1668
01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.980
<v Speaker 2>So you have different communities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>live different ways and you know,</v>

1669
01:10:47.981 --> 01:10:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well just if you don't like America then</v>

1670
01:10:50.171 --> 01:10:51.290
<v Speaker 2>leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Mexico if you like.</v>

1671
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.151
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1672
01:10:52.151 --> 01:10:53.410
<v Speaker 2>my friends are here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family's here,</v>

1673
01:10:53.411 --> 01:10:54.430
<v Speaker 2>my kids are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

1674
01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:58.090
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can do local politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just run different experiments.</v>

1675
01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often if you're complaining about it</v>

1676
01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:01.220
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means you care the most.</v>

1677
01:11:01.221 --> 01:11:02.990
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well hopefully.</v>

1678
01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.510
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have done this for another three</v>

1679
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.940
<v Speaker 1>hours so you're definitely going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come back because I barely got to any</v>

1680
01:11:07.941 --> 01:11:10.640
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff on my note card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thank you.</v>

1681
01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.673
<v Speaker 1>And I want to thank Michael Shermer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>joining me and you can check out his </v>

1682
01:11:14.391 --> 01:11:17.450
<v Speaker 1>work@skepticdotcomanditMichaelShermer.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1683
01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.171
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1684
01:11:18.171 --> 01:11:19.370

<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
