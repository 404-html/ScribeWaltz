00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Joining me via skype this week is Ayaan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hirsi Ali.</v>

2
00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I hope that most of you already know </v>
<v Speaker 1>ion,</v>

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.993
<v Speaker 1>but in case you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her story is truly an incredible one </v>

4
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:11.354
<v Speaker 1>that takes her from a childhood in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia to an elected member of </v>

5
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:17.750
<v Speaker 1>parliament in Holland to a fearless free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech advocate,</v>

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>a hated by both the extreme right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the regressive left.</v>

7
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>We'll dive deeper into her life's </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible journey shortly,</v>

8
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:25.454
<v Speaker 1>but before we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to take a moment to talk about </v>

9
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>why people like Ian actually matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As our show has gained momentum here,</v>

10
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.140
<v Speaker 1>I realized that what we're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really becoming an influential force for</v>

11
00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>the things that I believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mattered,</v>

12
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>namely the battle of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech,</v>

13
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:42.500
<v Speaker 1>and liberal values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

14
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.334
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want this to be about more than talk </v>

15
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:45.824
<v Speaker 1>because the repercussions of these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're talking about aren't just </v>

16
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 1>abstract notions.</v>

17
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>There stark realities for so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

18
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I had Hirsi Ali as a survivor in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of the word.</v>

19
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>She survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genital mutilation is a child.</v>

20
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>She survived a forced marriage to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin.</v>

21
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.813
<v Speaker 1>She survived the cold blooded murder of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend in broad daylight in Amsterdam </v>

22
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.463
<v Speaker 1>and subsequent death threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people would've given up after any </v>

23
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:10.124
<v Speaker 1>of these horrific events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people would have just accepted </v>

24
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>that this is what life has given them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and remain quiet.</v>

25
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Many people right this very second are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing just that.</v>

26
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.603
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find no fault with these people who </v>

27
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>remain silent under such subjugation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see no way out and sadly,</v>

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.233
<v Speaker 1>even though it's in the secular world </v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to help them fear the </v>

29
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:29.624
<v Speaker 1>repercussions if they speak out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not ion though she has bravely and </v>

30
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:33.194
<v Speaker 1>boldly fought for women's rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought the issue of female genital </v>

31
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>mutilation out in the open and </v>
<v Speaker 1>relentlessly made her life story a cause</v>

32
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>bigger than herself.</v>

33
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.253
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to sit back and privately talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these things or tweet about them </v>

34
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>from the comfort of your own home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's actually out there putting her</v>

35
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>life on the line after they already </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to take it from her.</v>

36
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to be very clear here that when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about these issues,</v>

37
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:55.184
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about ideas and not people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This seems to be a major sticking point </v>

38
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>in this conversation and I really hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can eventually get past that,</v>

39
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:03.824
<v Speaker 1>not just for the health of the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for all the young people currently </v>

40
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:07.634
<v Speaker 1>being indoctrinated with this ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if a political party had a </v>

41
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:13.940
<v Speaker 1>platform that included female genital </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutilation,</v>

42
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:18.941
<v Speaker 1>forced marriage and death for apostates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely insane and ridiculous.</v>

43
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Religious ideas,</v>

45
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.574
<v Speaker 1>cultural ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any ideas deserve the exact same </v>

46
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:28.130
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny no matter how uncomfortable it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us.</v>

47
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:28.964
<v Speaker 1>I for one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would rather live in a society that </v>

48
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 1>deals with uncomfortable truths out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the open,</v>

49
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>then one that leaves huge portions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people alone in the dark.</v>

50
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with Ion Hirsi Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights activist and author of the </v>

51
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>new book heretic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Islam needs a reformation?</v>

52
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Now I am welcome to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

53
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Thank you dave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me on.</v>

54
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to show all my cards right </v>
<v Speaker 1>upfront here.</v>

55
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a huge admirer of yours and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you've done such good work and,</v>

56
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and your story's amazing and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bravery is amazing.</v>

57
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to hold nothing back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just set us off on that,</v>

58
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>on that good welcoming note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay with you?</v>

59
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me on again,</v>

60
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>and we'll thank you for everything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

61
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.003
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton that I want to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and so many of the things that </v>

63
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:18.334
<v Speaker 1>your life is an example of are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we've been talking about on </v>

64
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:21.694
<v Speaker 1>the show here for months now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know many of my guests have been </v>

65
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.324
<v Speaker 1>people that you're friends with and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and coworkers with and I've done </v>

66
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>speeches with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>but your story is the most unique and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most interesting.</v>

68
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.334
<v Speaker 1>And I want to talk about the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought we could just spend about </v>

69
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:38.100
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes just sort of on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>biography and I know you've,</v>

70
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>you've discussed it a lot and that's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the books is about,</v>

71
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.393
<v Speaker 1>but if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so illuminating to sort of how you </v>

72
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:45.364
<v Speaker 1>got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you could just tell me a little </v>

73
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>bit first about growing up in Somalia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

74
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>let's just start with that.</v>

75
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born into a Somali Muslim </v>

76
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:02.671
<v Speaker 2>household and if I look at my journey </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

77
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I was born in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>69 November,</v>

78
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 2>my family went to Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lived in Ethiopia,</v>

79
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.593
<v Speaker 2>we lived in Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I went to the Netherlands and </v>

80
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 2>now I live in the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

81
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at my geographical </v>
<v Speaker 2>journey,</v>

82
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 2>there's really nothing unique about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

83
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>People from all over the world moved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different places,</v>

84
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 2>learn different languages and adapt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different situations.</v>

85
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that what Western is a find </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

86
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.783
<v Speaker 2>intriguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe in some ways disconcerting is </v>

87
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.350
<v Speaker 2>the intellectual journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

88
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I was raised as a Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was raised in a clan or tribal society</v>

89
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.773
<v Speaker 2>and the model framework that prevails </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is that of honor and shame and </v>

90
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a different kind of honor and shame</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what we believe here in the West,</v>

91
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

92
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.293
<v Speaker 2>as a little girl at the age of five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my genitals were cut and when I was old </v>

93
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 2>enough to ask why did that happen?</v>

94
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 2>My grandmother was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:08.404
<v Speaker 2>she really explained it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We purified you and if you are not </v>

96
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 2>purified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will never find a husband.</v>

97
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.373
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of practice is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't something that happened </v>

98
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:20.794
<v Speaker 2>only to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened to happens according to the </v>

99
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 2>United Nations number is two 98 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Somalis,</v>

100
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.243
<v Speaker 2>Egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sudanese.</v>

101
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.583
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one thing that people find </v>

102
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:33.904
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could you have India with something </v>

103
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>like that and come out a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>context like that.</v>

104
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And then fast forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm 22 years old,</v>

105
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 2>my father returns from a long journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

106
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 2>he had left at this for 10 years in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenya,</v>

107
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 2>a country that if you're a Somali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel you know,</v>

108
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:50.644
<v Speaker 2>you are in a foreign country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes back and he feels he has the show </v>

109
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.360
<v Speaker 2>as my father to marry me off until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first student,</v>

110
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 2>the first guy who comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm off the same clan as you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for a wife,</v>

112
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 2>which go would you like to offer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm the one who offered.</v>

113
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 2>So to Western as that seems pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>

114
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.593
<v Speaker 1>this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to be clear that this person was a </v>

115
00:06:11.411 --> 00:06:12.700
<v Speaker 1>distant cousin of yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

116
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Which probably wasn't that abnormal for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that area.</v>

117
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

118
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.544
<v Speaker 2>the closer the kinship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better because the only way to make </v>

119
00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:26.110
<v Speaker 2>sure that family members are loyal to </v>
<v Speaker 2>one another.</v>

120
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Share wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't mistreat one another,</v>

121
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.590
<v Speaker 2>is to try and marry within the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>family as much as possible.</v>

122
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Obviously with all the genetical </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

123
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what we were looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's it.</v>

124
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

125
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:41.380
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your roles as a male,</v>

126
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.243
<v Speaker 2>as a female that's given as a female you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can bring shame not only on your father </v>

127
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brother and sister,</v>

128
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 2>but the extended family as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even extended religion.</v>

129
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.813
<v Speaker 2>And so I think what is fascinating for </v>
<v Speaker 2>most Western as is how could you that </v>

130
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 2>intellectual journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come?</v>

131
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:05.011
<v Speaker 2>Once I believed in all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived it and now I,</v>

132
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.550
<v Speaker 2>as an individual you have a right to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>

134
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:10.384
<v Speaker 2>to choose who you want to marry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to cut off the genitals </v>

135
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.643
<v Speaker 2>of girls for them to be married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to be mad if you </v>

136
00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:22.441
<v Speaker 2>don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because as an economic security,</v>

137
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.460
<v Speaker 2>as a woman in the western context where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is the rule of law,</v>

138
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 2>what is freedom and where there's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful education systems.</v>

139
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I was a go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can actually choose what you want to</v>

140
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 2>do in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can map out your own destiny.</v>

141
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

142
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.063
<v Speaker 1>that's why I love your story so much and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I find you so inspirational because </v>

143
00:07:43.441 --> 00:07:45.510
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're truly living,</v>

144
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:50.460
<v Speaker 1>breathing proof that things can change </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that people and girls,</v>

145
00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:53.700
<v Speaker 1>especially from this part of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have a different life.</v>

146
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.563
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I find it so wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's just back up for just a </v>

147
00:07:57.121 --> 00:07:59.490
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the female genital mutilation.</v>

148
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:00.990
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this happened to you,</v>

149
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you immediately,</v>

150
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.610
<v Speaker 1>and you spoke to your grandmother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>

151
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.653
<v Speaker 1>but did you immediately questioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I to be that age and go </v>

152
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:11.700
<v Speaker 1>through something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long,</v>

153
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.563
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take before you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>were questioning everything about your </v>

154
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:18.414
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

155
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 2>At the age of five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't question it at the age of 10,</v>

156
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't question anything at the age of</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

157
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't question anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's always,</v>

158
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 2>as you grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember for me,</v>

159
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

160
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.783
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of evolving as you're evolving </v>

161
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 2>from childhood to maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the ages of 14,</v>

162
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.720
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 when I want to know,</v>

163
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of this life and why </v>

164
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>are we put on rf and is it only to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduce?</v>

165
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.100
<v Speaker 2>We're at that point in my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

166
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.170
<v Speaker 2>we're going through a lot of adversity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is what is the point,</v>

167
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 2>what is the point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of being suicidal,</v>

168
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 2>I joined the Muslim Brotherhood because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they make the point so very clear.</v>

169
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.773
<v Speaker 2>You've been put on this earth to be by </v>
<v Speaker 2>God to be tested for your absolute </v>

170
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be tested as a female in</v>

171
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:12.630
<v Speaker 2>various ways and as a male in various </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

172
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.213
<v Speaker 2>And you just have to say yes to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>submits and on your points and for your </v>

173
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:20.094
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to give you one </v>

174
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.150
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

175
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 2>way in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they,</v>

176
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.903
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does one even manipulate that as a </v>

177
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:29.724
<v Speaker 2>believing Muslim?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does one know that you know you're </v>

178
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:32.394
<v Speaker 2>doing what God wants you to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have two angels on either side of </v>

179
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 2>your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're hide side,</v>

180
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.570
<v Speaker 2>you have an angel that notes down minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>by minute,</v>

181
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:46.644
<v Speaker 2>second by second you have good </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentions versus you have bad </v>

182
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 2>intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're not here.</v>

183
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 2>We're not even talking about what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say before you say it,</v>

184
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.603
<v Speaker 2>but on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that same angel also notes Don what you </v>

185
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then your behavior and on your left,</v>

186
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.850
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that you do that is strong,</v>

187
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.690
<v Speaker 2>that angel is doing the book keeping and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will live,</v>

188
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 2>and at some point you die.</v>

189
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 2>And then there is the here after this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Day of Judgment.</v>

190
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 2>And we're told as Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one can escape that you're,</v>

191
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.170
<v Speaker 2>oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And His tribe,</v>

192
00:10:23.171 --> 00:10:25.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be for God and his tribe.</v>

193
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.413
<v Speaker 2>You know the prophets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the angels of all his other human </v>

194
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:29.274
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those two books are going to be put </v>

195
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:35.931
<v Speaker 2>on a scale and if you afraid handbook </v>
<v Speaker 2>weighs heavier than your left hand book,</v>

196
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 2>you go to heaven and if you are left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handbook goes weighs heavier,</v>

197
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 2>you go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know as you grow up,</v>

198
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.320
<v Speaker 2>it's especially with the radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamisation of or things.</v>

199
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.560
<v Speaker 2>These things are made so explicit to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you become so aware of them.</v>

200
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like taking,</v>

201
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 2>keeping track of your calories.</v>

202
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because even the way </v>

203
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:07.344
<v Speaker 1>you're describing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of a whimsical miss to the </v>

204
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 1>way you're describing it because now as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a secular person,</v>

205
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:12.984
<v Speaker 1>it sounds so ridiculous to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet there's literally millions of </v>

206
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:20.280
<v Speaker 1>people that believe in this in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a literal sense.</v>

207
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

208
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>

209
00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 2>you trust your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your teachers,</v>

210
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:29.520
<v Speaker 2>your and Islam is your religion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

211
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.923
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that all human beings who are </v>

212
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 2>religious are taught that the criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:36.950
<v Speaker 2>the framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

214
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 2>how do we know the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's right and what's wrong?</v>

215
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Religion tells us that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as a Muslim and Islam is a way of</v>

216
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.990
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are told that this is the difference</v>

217
00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:46.824
<v Speaker 2>between right and wrong and these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>are spelled out that which is forbidden </v>

218
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 2>her on that which is permitted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

219
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>And so then it's up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a level of,</v>

220
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 2>there's a level of choice in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

221
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.813
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like the guy on your shoulder </v>

222
00:12:04.441 --> 00:12:06.570
<v Speaker 1>already knows your intentions anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

223
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if you abstain,</v>

224
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.360
<v Speaker 2>they still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angel's still knows you want to indulge.</v>

225
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

226
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.420
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk a lot about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So it really is nice.</v>

231
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.070
<v Speaker 1>So I just want to do one more thing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your bio and then we can,</v>

232
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.360
<v Speaker 1>we can get into some of the specifics </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the doctrine and things sort of in</v>

233
00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:34.500
<v Speaker 1>your life after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

234
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.473
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made political asylum in the </v>

235
00:12:36.741 --> 00:12:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you then became member of parliament.</v>

236
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.920
<v Speaker 1>This is an incredible story of success </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

237
00:12:42.921 --> 00:12:45.320
<v Speaker 1>with all the refugee things going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe right now,</v>

238
00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:46.154
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of parallels to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You found safety and became successful </v>

239
00:12:49.131 --> 00:12:49.964
<v Speaker 1>and influential and went on to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about female genital mutilation and </v>

240
00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:55.190
<v Speaker 1>women's rights and all this incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

241
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.683
<v Speaker 1>But here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I have to mention that then </v>

242
00:12:58.581 --> 00:12:59.414
<v Speaker 1>Theo van Gogh was doing a movie based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a script that you wrote and he was </v>

243
00:13:03.711 --> 00:13:08.711
<v Speaker 1>killed by a Muslim extremist in broad </v>
<v Speaker 1>daylight in Amsterdam at 9:00</v>

244
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.930
<v Speaker 1>AM in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as if that wasn't horrific enough,</v>

245
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.093
<v Speaker 1>the person that killed him pinned a </v>
<v Speaker 1>death threat to you on this person's </v>

246
00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know,</v>

247
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:20.194
<v Speaker 1>I know you've talked about this a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know people hear things like this </v>

248
00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think he quite gets to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

249
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.190
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a movie sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

250
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.200
<v Speaker 1>And so I just want you to talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about it specifically,</v>

251
00:13:33.201 --> 00:13:36.860
<v Speaker 1>but also just the feeling that it left </v>
<v Speaker 1>you with the sort of terror.</v>

252
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Because it's one thing to say these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen,</v>

253
00:13:38.931 --> 00:13:39.764
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a person that these things </v>

254
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.500
<v Speaker 1>actually happen to.</v>

255
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.863
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way I have to say the difference </v>

256
00:13:46.881 --> 00:13:51.881
<v Speaker 2>between a Theo fungo and myself was that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believed in those threats.</v>

257
00:13:52.401 --> 00:13:53.234
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know exactly what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals who were threatening me </v>

258
00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 2>would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two years prior to a theo's death,</v>

259
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.133
<v Speaker 2>I started to take all kinds of security </v>
<v Speaker 2>precautions and when he and I were </v>

260
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:08.630
<v Speaker 2>working together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept saying to you,</v>

261
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds surreal in a Dutch </v>

262
00:14:12.111 --> 00:14:12.944
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he would tell me over and over </v>

263
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:16.214
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know the last thing in the </v>

264
00:14:18.351 --> 00:14:19.184
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone was killed because of what they </v>

265
00:14:21.381 --> 00:14:25.250
<v Speaker 2>believed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would give me years from the 17th</v>

266
00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:27.380
<v Speaker 2>century like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had Dutch,</v>

267
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.170
<v Speaker 2>this is the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't do that sort of thing,</v>

268
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.520
<v Speaker 2>so relaxed,</v>

269
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.220
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was actually true because.</v>

270
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.143
<v Speaker 1>Because Holland was an incredible place </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mixed cultures and religions and </v>

271
00:14:38.391 --> 00:14:39.680
<v Speaker 1>ethnicities and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

272
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.073
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

273
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.853
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was also in the wider Europe when in </v>

274
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of years ago to a 17th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18th century,</v>

275
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.770
<v Speaker 2>when on religious grounds people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>face in tolerance,</v>

276
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.520
<v Speaker 2>so much as to threaten their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkers,</v>

277
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.713
<v Speaker 2>creative people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would go to the Netherlands and </v>

278
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:06.671
<v Speaker 2>they would get a sanctuary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for him it was for Theo,</v>

279
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.730
<v Speaker 2>it making this film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't about that,</v>

280
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.070
<v Speaker 2>it was about preserving what he knew was</v>
<v Speaker 2>his culture,</v>

281
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:20.030
<v Speaker 2>his civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really not just Dutch civilization.</v>

282
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:25.031
<v Speaker 2>I think civilization with a capital c </v>
<v Speaker 2>when human beings can discuss and,</v>

283
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.403
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can disagree without having to threaten </v>

284
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 2>with force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

285
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So in a bizarre way by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by them killing him instead of you in a,</v>

286
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.923
<v Speaker 1>in a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this sounds perverse or </v>

287
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:37.424
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was more of a direct attack on </v>

288
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

289
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Because they were going after one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own,</v>

290
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:43.874
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

291
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.880
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had,</v>

292
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Speaker 2>I had accepted the perimeters that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government puts me within,</v>

293
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a security framework,</v>

294
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.193
<v Speaker 2>which was a really is something that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would never ever accept anything like </v>

295
00:15:58.151 --> 00:16:00.910
<v Speaker 2>that because these security measures a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cattail,</v>

296
00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:03.790
<v Speaker 2>you have freedom to a degree that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not free.</v>

297
00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:08.791
<v Speaker 2>And Him I'm never going to accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wanted to prove to them it is not</v>

298
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.960
<v Speaker 2>having to put a shell around the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are practicing free speech.</v>

299
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.943
<v Speaker 2>That is not the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer is to openly discuss these </v>

300
00:16:18.071 --> 00:16:18.904
<v Speaker 2>things and make them open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If these people are provoked by what is </v>

301
00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:25.630
<v Speaker 2>that was that particular film was this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what the Koran says about women.</v>

302
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.110
<v Speaker 2>This is how it's put into practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need to be talking about.</v>

303
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Why we shouldn't be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>

304
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And he gets killed.</v>

305
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.153
<v Speaker 2>And I think by doing the murderer killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>Theo fungo and that incident confronted </v>

306
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.233
<v Speaker 2>Dutch society and Dutch leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the wider European Western </v>

307
00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:44.940
<v Speaker 2>leadership with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

308
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.250
<v Speaker 2>we can all go around saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the First Amendment,</v>

309
00:16:48.251 --> 00:16:50.230
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of expression,</v>

310
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.131
<v Speaker 2>all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

311
00:16:51.131 --> 00:16:51.964
<v Speaker 2>And the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are we willing to do to </v>

312
00:16:54.551 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 2>preserve it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

313
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.863
<v Speaker 2>he has left us with that question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm disappointed to say that so far we </v>

314
00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:02.800
<v Speaker 2>haven't done that much because as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

315
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.200
<v Speaker 2>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of this year,</v>

316
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.100
<v Speaker 2>the cartoonists in Paris or killed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the threats to free speech continues and</v>

317
00:17:13.571 --> 00:17:16.420
<v Speaker 2>if government policies are anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go by,</v>

318
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.620
<v Speaker 2>it seems as if they are telling us it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>best not to provoke them.</v>

319
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

320
00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:23.810
<v Speaker 1>So I really want to focus on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's been one of,</v>

321
00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this free speech,</v>

322
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and political correctness.</v>

323
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:28.254
<v Speaker 1>It's become this perfect storm that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually strengthening everything that </v>

324
00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:31.734
<v Speaker 1>it should be against a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just to put a final cap on your bio </v>

325
00:17:35.101 --> 00:17:36.900
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it like for you?</v>

326
00:17:36.901 --> 00:17:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean really at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the personal level,</v>

327
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.290
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was killed,</v>

328
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.810
<v Speaker 1>did you want to just disappeared?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you want to leave the country?</v>

329
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you want to give up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because now you've lived for these last.</v>

330
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 1>How many years ago was this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was</v>

331
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 2>this for,</v>

332
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.993
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've lived for these last 11 years </v>

333
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 1>honoring everything he stood for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure there must have been a time</v>

334
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:57.360
<v Speaker 1>when you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just get out of this.</v>

335
00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:58.194
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

336
00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it every day.</v>

337
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so tempting to just think,</v>

338
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done enough.</v>

339
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

340
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.400
<v Speaker 2>This is my age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 46 years old next month.</v>

341
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing for me in it personally,</v>

342
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's what high accident made the</v>

343
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.164
<v Speaker 2>difference between being comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if I just disappeared and changed </v>

344
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:24.174
<v Speaker 2>my name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be very comfortable versus </v>

345
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.660
<v Speaker 2>actually living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is when you're challenged and when</v>

346
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 2>civilization is challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when our freedoms are challenged,</v>

347
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.853
<v Speaker 2>we always rely on those who stand up for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and those who wanted to push their </v>

348
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 2>agenda through intimidation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through force.</v>

349
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 2>They know that their argument is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak.</v>

350
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would they avoid discussion?</v>

351
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:55.101
<v Speaker 2>Why is it difficult for them to showcase</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Quran and Allah and Heidi's the</v>

352
00:18:58.531 --> 00:18:59.364
<v Speaker 2>sayings of the Prophet Mohammed and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish food ins and the practice of </v>

353
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Islam says about women in essays to </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

354
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.133
<v Speaker 2>Why are they afraid of women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All women had a 100 percent the freedom </v>

355
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 2>to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if your message is superior,</v>

356
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.723
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not allow people to just choose for </v>

357
00:19:19.541 --> 00:19:19.670
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

358
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.660
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we've really focused </v>
<v Speaker 1>on here is what I'm now calling and what</v>

359
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Majid new eyes has coined as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regressive left.</v>

360
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.433
<v Speaker 1>That there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people I come from the </v>

361
00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:30.734
<v Speaker 1>progressive world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's where I've been for these </v>

362
00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:33.344
<v Speaker 1>last couple of years and it's only </v>
<v Speaker 1>really in the last six months that I've </v>

363
00:19:35.871 --> 00:19:38.930
<v Speaker 1>had my own awakening that I realized it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was my guys.</v>

364
00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It's my guys on the left that are trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to silence people like you in silence.</v>

365
00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:47.150
<v Speaker 1>People like Sam Harris and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and modular and all of this.</v>

366
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had salmon.</v>

367
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I've had my jacket on and I include you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

368
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think partially I think that Sam </v>

369
00:19:55.191 --> 00:19:59.750
<v Speaker 1>said that party or my agent said the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of his awakening was after a debate</v>

370
00:19:59.751 --> 00:20:01.610
<v Speaker 1>that he had with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

371
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.280
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of this coming from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left?</v>

372
00:20:04.281 --> 00:20:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Because the left is supposed to debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

373
00:20:06.891 --> 00:20:07.724
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be about ideas free </v>

374
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:14.180
<v Speaker 1>thought and yet it's those very people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are trying to silence you.</v>

375
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazed by this.</v>

376
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I think what I've seen and I could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

377
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:23.810
<v Speaker 2>is that what the left does is they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the emphasis on justice,</v>

378
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.673
<v Speaker 2>the concept of justice and maybe what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rights rather classical liberals </v>

379
00:20:29.331 --> 00:20:32.020
<v Speaker 2>because those are the people I identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>with and in the US,</v>

380
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.660
<v Speaker 2>they are called conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes libertarians.</v>

381
00:20:35.661 --> 00:20:36.494
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what classical liberals do is they put </v>

382
00:20:38.871 --> 00:20:39.704
<v Speaker 2>the emphasis on freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was exposed to these concepts </v>

383
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.213
<v Speaker 2>between say 1995 when I go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of flight and until 2000 and </v>

384
00:20:50.731 --> 00:20:55.731
<v Speaker 2>then 2001 something happens that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>me intent on testing these ideas.</v>

385
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.640
<v Speaker 2>And what I have discovered like many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people before me,</v>

386
00:21:00.641 --> 00:21:01.474
<v Speaker 2>and I think you will as as you grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there is no justice without </v>

387
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you accept and that is freedom</v>

388
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:13.683
<v Speaker 2>from coercion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom from being forced into doing </v>

389
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:16.774
<v Speaker 2>something you don't want to do or using </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tools of state to make individuals </v>

390
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:25.310
<v Speaker 2>to do something they don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or with government failing art,</v>

391
00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having one individual take the freedom </v>

392
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.940
<v Speaker 2>of the other individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have no freedom then you will</v>

393
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:31.774
<v Speaker 2>have no adjustments.</v>

394
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

395
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 1>so I'm with you on just to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary.</v>

396
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.243
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of the tactics that </v>

397
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:41.530
<v Speaker 1>they use because there's been so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about it so much,</v>

398
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:44.800
<v Speaker 1>but so much lying and smearing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's views including your own.</v>

399
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:45.843
<v Speaker 1>Even when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've just tweeted that I'm having </v>

400
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:47.824
<v Speaker 1>you on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately because we've built </v>

401
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 1>something good here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

402
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of it was positive,</v>

403
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:53.404
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people she's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're telling me that you are </v>

404
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

405
00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of the tactics that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using?</v>

406
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Because I do think they think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something lofty.</v>

407
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:04.024
<v Speaker 1>They think they're there helping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>downtrodden or something like that when </v>

408
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:08.404
<v Speaker 1>in actuality they're strengthening the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very people that they should by </v>

409
00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:12.790
<v Speaker 1>definition be against</v>

410
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.850
<v Speaker 2>and I think that is because if you put </v>
<v Speaker 2>the emphasis on justice,</v>

411
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you are by definition going to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about groups and collectives.</v>

412
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Groups in abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You belong to a group for a short period</v>

413
00:22:26.121 --> 00:22:28.250
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a member of whatever you are,</v>

414
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.093
<v Speaker 2>collective you are a member of for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of time but freely all </v>

415
00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:33.410
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are an individual.</v>

416
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.513
<v Speaker 2>So the basic arguments I used to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the left and I started out in the </v>

417
00:22:38.751 --> 00:22:39.584
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you want to protect the culture and </v>

418
00:22:43.371 --> 00:22:46.550
<v Speaker 2>the religion of this collective and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective is saying,</v>

419
00:22:46.551 --> 00:22:49.880
<v Speaker 2>if we don't practice our religion the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way we used to back at home,</v>

420
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.133
<v Speaker 2>we are just not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We feel deprived when we feel </v>

421
00:22:53.301 --> 00:22:54.134
<v Speaker 2>persecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't feel at home and that has all </v>

422
00:22:56.571 --> 00:22:59.600
<v Speaker 2>kinds of psychological effect on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire group.</v>

423
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.520
<v Speaker 2>But what about the individual?</v>

424
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.190
<v Speaker 2>What about the individual goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's removed from school?</v>

425
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:08.420
<v Speaker 2>What about individual girl who's forced </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a marriage where she's consistently</v>

426
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.273
<v Speaker 2>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can't reach out to her parents </v>

427
00:23:10.581 --> 00:23:13.970
<v Speaker 2>because they put her in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her husband thinks he has a right.</v>

428
00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.920
<v Speaker 2>What about that individual?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

429
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.460
<v Speaker 2>What about the individual right to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do this.</v>

430
00:23:19.461 --> 00:23:20.294
<v Speaker 2>I want to do something else and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing this individual into doing that </v>

431
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.900
<v Speaker 2>and these constitutions in liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries is all about heck.</v>

432
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:29.783
<v Speaker 2>Organizing that individual freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspiring to protect it as much as </v>

433
00:23:34.251 --> 00:23:35.084
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what I tell my left wing friends </v>

434
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.640
<v Speaker 2>and I have a lot of them because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them have good intentions and they're</v>

435
00:23:40.641 --> 00:23:43.220
<v Speaker 2>progressive and they want to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the poor.</v>

436
00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 2>The downtown.</v>

437
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

438
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.793
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to take them back to that unit so </v>

439
00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.140
<v Speaker 2>that they can empathize with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're gay and you're on the left and</v>

440
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand you belong to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

441
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting for the right in America</v>
<v Speaker 2>to marry,</v>

442
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.943
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also fighting for the rights of </v>

443
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 2>some minority collective to do what ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>

444
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.513
<v Speaker 2>To the individual members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you be thinking about the </v>

445
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:10.574
<v Speaker 2>plight of the individual members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who can't voice their wishes and </v>

446
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 2>those who if they do have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>

447
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:17.864
<v Speaker 2>so die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not talking about death and </v>

448
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:19.994
<v Speaker 2>threats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about your father looking </v>

449
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 2>you in the eye and tell him you're no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer my daughter.</v>

450
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:24.464
<v Speaker 2>I disown you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You control yourself up in the mosque </v>

451
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 2>you are not invited to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you are shunned.</v>

452
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.583
<v Speaker 2>And think of the psychological impact of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that on the individual who chooses to </v>

453
00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:42.161
<v Speaker 2>have a lifestyle that is not in sync </v>
<v Speaker 2>with seventh century lifestyle.</v>

454
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that lifestyle,</v>

455
00:24:45.481 --> 00:24:48.300
<v Speaker 1>whether they're gay or a or just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

456
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.140
<v Speaker 1>is what is what the progressive should </v>
<v Speaker 1>always be fighting for.</v>

457
00:24:52.141 --> 00:24:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's the ultimate irony in this.</v>

458
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate irony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these women that I.</v>

459
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:57.434
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is my background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be free to determine my own </v>

460
00:25:01.721 --> 00:25:03.280
<v Speaker 2>destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to marry the man.</v>

461
00:25:03.281 --> 00:25:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I was first in to Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to find my own mate in life.</v>

462
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to work and I wanted to finish </v>
<v Speaker 2>my education and I was still.</v>

463
00:25:10.731 --> 00:25:15.310
<v Speaker 2>That's going to bring shame on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now with the emphasis on us,</v>

464
00:25:15.311 --> 00:25:16.810
<v Speaker 2>that is the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the collective,</v>

465
00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.660
<v Speaker 2>so it's always you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual,</v>

466
00:25:19.661 --> 00:25:20.494
<v Speaker 2>the unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're constantly being told you're </v>

467
00:25:22.751 --> 00:25:25.450
<v Speaker 2>so selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're bringing down the whole family,</v>

468
00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:29.130
<v Speaker 2>the whole clan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole group and a in.</v>

469
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.083
<v Speaker 2>And here's the irony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it used to be the left that </v>

470
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.013
<v Speaker 2>would take up the defense of the weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now unfortunately we live in a time </v>

471
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.440
<v Speaker 2>when it is the left that has decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>define week units as groups,</v>

472
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.910
<v Speaker 2>not individuals.</v>

473
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what can we do?</v>

474
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.400
<v Speaker 1>So what can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

475
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:59.430
<v Speaker 1>people in the public sphere with a voice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that care about people on the left.</v>

476
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.680
<v Speaker 1>They're not even people I left that care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about liberal values.</v>

477
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.793
<v Speaker 1>What can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when I see the tactics and the </v>

478
00:26:06.041 --> 00:26:08.830
<v Speaker 1>way they treat you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even,</v>

479
00:26:08.831 --> 00:26:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I've asked this to Sam and Majid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

480
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there must be this piece of you that </v>

481
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:14.110
<v Speaker 1>wants to get out and that's why I asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to.</v>

482
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.153
<v Speaker 1>And I partly think that the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it is they want to do enough </v>

483
00:26:17.801 --> 00:26:21.490
<v Speaker 1>damage to you guys and people like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that everyone else.</v>

484
00:26:21.491 --> 00:26:23.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

485
00:26:23.441 --> 00:26:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll get rid of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll just say,</v>

486
00:26:25.631 --> 00:26:28.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this anymore and that.</v>

487
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.120
<v Speaker 1>But it's the chilling effect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone beneath you.</v>

488
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.800
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we fight this?</v>

489
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:37.360
<v Speaker 2>It's above the utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what we have to do is we have to</v>

490
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.630
<v Speaker 2>expose the fact that they are after a </v>
<v Speaker 2>utopia,</v>

491
00:26:40.631 --> 00:26:43.200
<v Speaker 2>this whole justice thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

492
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life would be wonderful if we had to.</v>

493
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Sharia law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us.</v>

494
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just uncovered their message really</v>
<v Speaker 2>would we?</v>

495
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.900
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you are a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to revisit the basic principles</v>

496
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:59.850
<v Speaker 2>of liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was about individuals.</v>

497
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.090
<v Speaker 2>That is how the aristocracy was put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>its place back then when there was,</v>

498
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all of these rights because I </v>

499
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:12.840
<v Speaker 2>happened to belong to this family and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all surfs and you serve as,</v>

500
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 2>as aristocrats because you happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>belong to that collective.</v>

501
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.003
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is about individual freedom when it </v>

502
00:27:19.381 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 2>was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.443
<v Speaker 2>fighting slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to recognize the other person </v>

504
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:24.894
<v Speaker 2>who was the slave as a fellow human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being and as an individual fighting for </v>

505
00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:30.270
<v Speaker 2>women's rights.</v>

506
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.103
<v Speaker 2>You had to recognize women as fellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual human rights in human beings </v>

507
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.633
<v Speaker 2>and the whole concept of human rights is</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the individual and the freedom </v>

508
00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:40.704
<v Speaker 2>of the individual and we know that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are social animals and are social </v>

509
00:27:43.681 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 2>animals and as individuals within our </v>
<v Speaker 2>families and within our communities,</v>

510
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:52.550
<v Speaker 2>within our workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to negotiate that sweet spot,</v>

511
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.203
<v Speaker 2>that space where you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be me and and this is how I can </v>

512
00:27:58.171 --> 00:28:00.870
<v Speaker 2>serve my community and this is how my </v>
<v Speaker 2>community can serve me,</v>

513
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.823
<v Speaker 2>but all of that is not going to work if </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual liberty is compromised and </v>

514
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:10.260
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately the people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>inherited these systems,</v>

515
00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:12.900
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europeans are the free countries.</v>

516
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 2>They're compromising that because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's so.</v>

517
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.920
<v Speaker 2>There's this collective collective and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this story,</v>

518
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:22.620
<v Speaker 2>that narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

519
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's a lofty goal somehow,</v>

520
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.353
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

521
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Do you sense that the tide is turning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

522
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:29.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social justice warrior thing and </v>

523
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.443
<v Speaker 1>this whole movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's been gaining strength </v>

524
00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.110
<v Speaker 1>for the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think partly because of Charlie</v>

525
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Hebdo and sort of the general absurdity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of so much of it online and you know,</v>

526
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:44.953
<v Speaker 1>Brandeis University saying that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to give you an honorary </v>

527
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.460
<v Speaker 1>doctorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

528
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.303
<v Speaker 1>the height of absurdity to not give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>an honorary doctorate after they said </v>

529
00:28:53.391 --> 00:28:54.224
<v Speaker 1>they would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I do sense that the tide is </v>

530
00:28:56.121 --> 00:28:56.750
<v Speaker 1>turning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

531
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Am I just being optimistic there or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel that?</v>

532
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.453
<v Speaker 2>I think what we're seeing is more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more confrontations that really </v>

533
00:29:04.631 --> 00:29:09.631
<v Speaker 2>pronounce this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this struggle and I think one of them is</v>

534
00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Israel versus the Arab Muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

535
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.370
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is a liberal country.</v>

536
00:29:18.371 --> 00:29:21.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a democracy for goodness sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

537
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:26.350
<v Speaker 2>and we find a outside is telling them </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they can and can't do.</v>

538
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you know in the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

539
00:29:29.411 --> 00:29:33.010
<v Speaker 2>if we had people throwing rocks at us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knifing us.</v>

540
00:29:33.011 --> 00:29:35.530
<v Speaker 2>If you had the leadership of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition saying,</v>

541
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a knife,</v>

542
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:37.723
<v Speaker 2>take a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take whatever weapon you can go after </v>

543
00:29:39.431 --> 00:29:40.264
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would find it completely and deal </v>

544
00:29:42.101 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 2>with it appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when Israel desert,</v>

545
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 2>we demonized and vilified Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a weird way,</v>

546
00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 2>that's one way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's one example.</v>

547
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:51.514
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we have more examples and </v>

548
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 2>you've mentioned magic and myself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other,</v>

549
00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:57.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

550
00:29:57.921 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what is the right time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use Muslim reformers,</v>

551
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Muslim modifiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim heritage.</v>

552
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that is the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heretic is you're on the inside,</v>

553
00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:07.624
<v Speaker 2>you start to ask questions and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll fight and shunned by this group </v>

554
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.123
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want to change or </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have an agenda for Sharia </v>

555
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:16.084
<v Speaker 2>and the Caliphate and Jihad and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up to that and then they'd go </v>

556
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:20.044
<v Speaker 2>after you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're seeing so many of these </v>

557
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 2>confrontations in so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>

558
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think the mistake is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

559
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.433
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a socialist in the United </v>

560
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.593
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think you know you're a Bernie Sanders </v>

561
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.193
<v Speaker 2>and you're hiding for president and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are Donald Trump and you're running for </v>

562
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:35.494
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say the most ridiculous things </v>

563
00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:37.624
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to kill him and nobody </v>

564
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:43.000
<v Speaker 2>expects you to be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you are attacked,</v>

565
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.330
<v Speaker 2>if any violence against these two right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

566
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:50.440
<v Speaker 2>these two extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American population is going to meet</v>

567
00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:51.274
<v Speaker 2>that with such rejection and it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be reviled and we have to teach the </v>

568
00:30:55.661 --> 00:31:00.580
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world that it is possible to</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree and to disagree radically,</v>

569
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 2>but not use violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less violence is used.</v>

570
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.243
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting thought because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>always think or I think that our system </v>

571
00:31:09.061 --> 00:31:12.420
<v Speaker 1>is so broken here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our political system is so broken and we</v>

572
00:31:12.421 --> 00:31:16.110
<v Speaker 1>can't get things done properly in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse is so silly and cable news,</v>

573
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.570
<v Speaker 1>but actually the way you just said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that look,</v>

574
00:31:18.571 --> 00:31:21.930
<v Speaker 1>you have these two people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be further from each other.</v>

575
00:31:21.931 --> 00:31:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Trump and sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate capitalist,</v>

576
00:31:23.791 --> 00:31:26.730
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet they're not.</v>

577
00:31:26.731 --> 00:31:27.564
<v Speaker 1>There is no threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no credible threat to their </v>

578
00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:30.031
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

579
00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 1>So that does show that we have something</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good about our,</v>

580
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.050
<v Speaker 1>our Western society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not cool to say that,</v>

581
00:31:37.051 --> 00:31:38.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

582
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

583
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.943
<v Speaker 2>it goes even more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also expect them to shake hands on </v>

584
00:31:44.371 --> 00:31:45.204
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We expect them to be civil to one </v>

585
00:31:47.251 --> 00:31:49.890
<v Speaker 2>another and they can disagree as much as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>

586
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.710
<v Speaker 2>but you know why he is the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>

587
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:54.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the establishment Republicans.</v>

588
00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Why are they angry with Donald trump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's because of his ideas.</v>

589
00:31:58.050 --> 00:31:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes just because of the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaks.</v>

590
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.330
<v Speaker 2>That goes a little tool five gets too </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to,</v>

591
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncivilized behavior,</v>

592
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.280
<v Speaker 2>violent behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not do that.</v>

593
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.740
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a culture here where,</v>

594
00:32:10.741 --> 00:32:11.820
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are violent.</v>

595
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:12.863
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of guns out there and </v>

596
00:32:14.641 --> 00:32:15.474
<v Speaker 2>people use these guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mainstream Americans expect </v>

597
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.540
<v Speaker 2>mainstream Americans to behave in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>

598
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a culture that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not disagree.</v>

599
00:32:26.851 --> 00:32:27.990
<v Speaker 2>We know we all disagree.</v>

600
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Say the system is broken or it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being that's fragile.</v>

601
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.633
<v Speaker 2>We disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we have is a system where you can </v>

602
00:32:36.571 --> 00:32:37.404
<v Speaker 2>have these disagreements and these and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can change your mind or you can go </v>

603
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:45.470
<v Speaker 2>as radical as you please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you are not expected to use violence</v>

604
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.573
<v Speaker 2>and the government is there to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and with people putting question </v>

605
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:51.344
<v Speaker 2>marks on the first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two different things is one part of </v>

606
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 2>it is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can disagree with one another as much</v>

607
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:59.510
<v Speaker 2>as we like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a system here.</v>

608
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 2>There's an infrastructure that allows us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to disagree with one another without the</v>

609
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:04.814
<v Speaker 2>use of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start putting question marks on </v>

610
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 2>the first amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

611
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defamation laws,</v>

612
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:13.743
<v Speaker 2>there are some religions or there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>some icons that you may or may not </v>

613
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:20.750
<v Speaker 2>criticize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you are really eroding the system.</v>

614
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:21.763
<v Speaker 2>You're bringing down the system and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>system is superior to any other system </v>

615
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen any other system in </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

616
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.193
<v Speaker 2>So our job is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's where people like you and me </v>

617
00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:35.624
<v Speaker 2>and Sam and magic seeing it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to be careful that the </v>

618
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.413
<v Speaker 2>government does not enact lows where </v>
<v Speaker 2>some ideas cannot be criticized and </v>

619
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:51.800
<v Speaker 2>religion is just an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be to you and everything,</v>

620
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:56.090
<v Speaker 2>but to me it's just an idea and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas can be criticized.</v>

621
00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 2>It makes your idea on the stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not.</v>

622
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we must not challenge the.</v>

623
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't erode the system that makes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

624
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:04.783
<v Speaker 2>so I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a first amendment fundamentalist if </v>

625
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:07.664
<v Speaker 2>you want.</v>

626
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be a fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>of some kind,</v>

627
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that that's the one to be so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know a lot of people will,</v>

628
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 1>as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll call you and Islamophobia.</v>

629
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell Majid who's Muslim and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia.</v>

630
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.270
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the meme of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia?</v>

631
00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:24.104
<v Speaker 1>Because at one time I feared that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government was going to come for our </v>

632
00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:29.930
<v Speaker 1>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so infringing on our First Amendment.</v>

633
00:34:29.931 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now fearing is that we're taking it away</v>

634
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:33.404
<v Speaker 1>from ourselves by what the universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing and by every debate ends in </v>

635
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:39.230
<v Speaker 1>someone being called a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

636
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 1>We know what's happened to Sam that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>due.</v>

637
00:34:41.691 --> 00:34:42.524
<v Speaker 1>It's not the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the use of words to stifle </v>

638
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:46.754
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

639
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.640
<v Speaker 2>We're doing it ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

640
00:34:48.641 --> 00:34:49.474
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Charlie Hebdo incident </v>

641
00:34:50.681 --> 00:34:51.514
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I expected all newspapers in the free </v>

642
00:34:53.381 --> 00:34:54.880
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all televisions,</v>

643
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:55.743
<v Speaker 2>the whole media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stand in solidarity with them and </v>

644
00:34:58.601 --> 00:35:01.720
<v Speaker 2>republish those cartoons to show them </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we do.</v>

645
00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:03.610
<v Speaker 2>This is what we are about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an idea.</v>

646
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.540
<v Speaker 2>And the Islamophobia meme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>

647
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:08.690
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

648
00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:09.524
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to criticize an idea is not to be </v>

649
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.940
<v Speaker 2>phobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam is a religion.</v>

650
00:35:12.941 --> 00:35:14.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a set of beliefs.</v>

651
00:35:14.741 --> 00:35:16.450
<v Speaker 2>It's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the people.</v>

652
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Muslims are very diverse and many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them disagree on many things,</v>

653
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.970
<v Speaker 2>including the position of Muhammad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including whether Marvin should be drawn</v>

654
00:35:24.971 --> 00:35:26.380
<v Speaker 2>or not drawn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized,</v>

655
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.870
<v Speaker 2>not criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So given all of that,</v>

656
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.943
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

657
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not only the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't,</v>

658
00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 2>of course the government is lobbied by </v>
<v Speaker 2>57 member nations of the Organization of</v>

659
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.553
<v Speaker 2>Islamic Conference that through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United Nations and other international </v>

660
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:43.824
<v Speaker 2>bodies is trying to make them adopt laws</v>
<v Speaker 2>that leave Islam out of that realm and </v>

661
00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 2>discussing ideas and criticizing ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not only that we're doing it to</v>

662
00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools are doing it,</v>

663
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.020
<v Speaker 2>the education system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

664
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 2>the press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

665
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.813
<v Speaker 2>even individually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that some of it is because we </v>

666
00:36:08.011 --> 00:36:09.750
<v Speaker 2>are scared because we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 2>we don't want it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to be short,</v>

668
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:13.890
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to be killed,</v>

669
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.370
<v Speaker 1>which is just what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

670
00:36:15.371 --> 00:36:17.590
<v Speaker 1>They want the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the fear is as powerful,</v>

671
00:36:17.591 --> 00:36:20.890
<v Speaker 1>if not more powerful perhaps than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than murdering somebody.</v>

672
00:36:20.891 --> 00:36:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

673
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

674
00:36:23.011 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole point of terrorism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

675
00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.440
<v Speaker 2>They want to get what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is.</v>

676
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:29.543
<v Speaker 2>So I would like to promote the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women are equal and should be </v>

677
00:36:35.101 --> 00:36:35.934
<v Speaker 2>equal before the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get into every Muslim </v>

678
00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:42.210
<v Speaker 2>community and promote that idea and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it's an uphill battle,</v>

679
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:43.703
<v Speaker 2>but for me to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life is not safe enough for the </v>

680
00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:49.764
<v Speaker 2>Islamic extremists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to promote the idea among </v>

681
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Muslim American citizens and others that</v>
<v Speaker 2>women and men should behave in a certain</v>

682
00:36:57.721 --> 00:36:58.554
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can take advantage of all the </v>

683
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:02.790
<v Speaker 2>freedoms that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of religion,</v>

684
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 2>of association of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I give them that,</v>

685
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.933
<v Speaker 2>why can't I do the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is my government not protecting me </v>

686
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.113
<v Speaker 2>to promote my message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 100 percent aligned with our </v>

687
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:16.404
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

688
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating because it's so many</v>

689
00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:22.090
<v Speaker 1>levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of craziness.</v>

690
00:37:22.091 --> 00:37:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

691
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think part of the issue also is </v>

692
00:37:25.841 --> 00:37:29.920
<v Speaker 1>that people get a little lost in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the definition of terms.</v>

693
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so could you explain the difference </v>

694
00:37:32.741 --> 00:37:33.574
<v Speaker 1>between the doctrine of Islam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sort of the religious side of it </v>

695
00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:38.163
<v Speaker 1>versus what political Islam is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that that split in </v>

696
00:37:41.321 --> 00:37:44.320
<v Speaker 1>itself I think has many people very </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused.</v>

697
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.333
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I'm trying to use this </v>
<v Speaker 1>show to get people just to understand </v>

698
00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:48.124
<v Speaker 1>the basic tenants of all this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe that will remove a bit of </v>

699
00:37:51.971 --> 00:37:54.970
<v Speaker 1>where everyone says this is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigotry and racism and things like that.</v>

700
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the seventh century,</v>

701
00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:01.160
<v Speaker 2>a man called Mohammed comes with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>

702
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.000
<v Speaker 2>So man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed the message,</v>

703
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:04.993
<v Speaker 2>submit to one God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about all your other got submits </v>

704
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.090
<v Speaker 2>to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

705
00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:08.923
<v Speaker 2>the one who spoke to me and they're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cave called a hero and a bunch of </v>

706
00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.590
<v Speaker 2>people say this mighty is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are going to abandon our gods?</v>

707
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 2>And he carries on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the first 10 years,</v>

708
00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.053
<v Speaker 2>what he is preaching is my God requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to pray too fast to look after the </v>

709
00:38:28.851 --> 00:38:30.230
<v Speaker 2>poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be charitable.</v>

710
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.483
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the things he was saying in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those fast 10 years would fall under </v>

711
00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 2>what you and I and a lot of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Europeans understand as religion.</v>

712
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.640
<v Speaker 2>You believe in these things and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>something good will happen.</v>

713
00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe something good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you can mobilize.</v>

714
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 2>If you look after the orphans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what's wrong with that?</v>

715
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.280
<v Speaker 2>That's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

716
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.183
<v Speaker 2>And then the next 10 years of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moves from Mecca to a place called </v>

717
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Medina and he starts to put together a </v>
<v Speaker 2>militia and he starts to wage war.</v>

718
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Small wars that he wins that get bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he starts to concrete and concrete.</v>

719
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.373
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that goes to his head and from then </v>

720
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 2>on the second 10 years of Mohammed's </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

721
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 2>that's when political Islam comes about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the first 10 years he was saying,</v>

722
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:19.210
<v Speaker 2>please reconsider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about having all these many,</v>

723
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 2>many gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give them a come to my one.</v>

724
00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Gordon would be your choice to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Medina onwards.</v>

725
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.193
<v Speaker 2>You had to do it had to happen at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tip of a sword and every victory </v>

726
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.143
<v Speaker 2>strengthened him and his followers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that and that happened for </v>

727
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:34.954
<v Speaker 2>centuries afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the people today who are </v>

728
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:43.651
<v Speaker 2>using Islam as a political tool to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to do what they want them to do.</v>

729
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 2>A following Muhammad in this example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

730
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:48.843
<v Speaker 2>That is why Mohammed is relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he needs to be discussed to </v>

731
00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:54.310
<v Speaker 2>be drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was he?</v>

732
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Did he really live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this really what he said?</v>

733
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.780
<v Speaker 2>If he said so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it really more moral?</v>

734
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.870
<v Speaker 2>We should discuss Mohammed the way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss Hannibal,</v>

735
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Julius Caesar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know this will water is of the past.</v>

736
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.673
<v Speaker 2>They Alexander the Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They established all these empires and </v>

737
00:40:15.551 --> 00:40:20.320
<v Speaker 2>then now the historical figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how and it can we,</v>

738
00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.213
<v Speaker 2>can we do that in 21st century America </v>
<v Speaker 2>without having our own demand around me </v>

739
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.580
<v Speaker 2>all the time without fearing for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

740
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that the answer is to that,</v>

741
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.840
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people on the left,</v>

742
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.580
<v Speaker 2>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well intentioned,</v>

743
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.850
<v Speaker 2>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy liberals think that the way that</v>

744
00:40:41.851 --> 00:40:42.684
<v Speaker 2>they can make Muslims as a minority feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>at home in America is by respecting the </v>

745
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.793
<v Speaker 2>icon and I think the best respect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can pay to the icon is to put him </v>

746
00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:57.120
<v Speaker 2>along with all those other icons of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

747
00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.673
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what Bill Maher refers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as the soft bigotry of low </v>

748
00:41:02.061 --> 00:41:06.560
<v Speaker 1>expectations that somehow we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat these people differently.</v>

749
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

750
00:41:08.061 --> 00:41:11.120
<v Speaker 1>I want everyone to be treated as Shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>as everyone else.</v>

751
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.103
<v Speaker 1>It's about treating them well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treat everyone equally crappy that will </v>

752
00:41:14.661 --> 00:41:15.494
<v Speaker 1>be good for me</v>

753
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bail my,</v>

754
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:17.760
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

755
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.593
<v Speaker 2>his own clients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is one of those few liberals who is </v>

756
00:41:21.451 --> 00:41:22.284
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to make an exception for </v>

757
00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:27.030
<v Speaker 2>my fellow American sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would I?</v>

758
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.033
<v Speaker 2>I want them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see them as equals and he knows there </v>

759
00:41:31.591 --> 00:41:36.050
<v Speaker 2>are a lot of Muslim Americans laugh at </v>
<v Speaker 2>his jokes and who love him,</v>

760
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.853
<v Speaker 2>but they have to hide that from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic extremists inside of their </v>

761
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 2>families and their communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

762
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:44.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's our job to emancipate them by </v>

763
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:46.990
<v Speaker 2>saying I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

764
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.823
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in Pakistan or Afghanistan or </v>

765
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:50.603
<v Speaker 2>Somali or Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now in America probably in La and I </v>

766
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 2>want to laugh at my luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His jokes.</v>

767
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy part,</v>

768
00:41:57.921 --> 00:41:58.754
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Bill Maher when it comes to this </v>

769
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really being treated like a pariah by</v>

770
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 1>the regressive left and they're calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

771
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:06.314
<v Speaker 1>And Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course racist because of that whole </v>

772
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Ben Affleck thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've spent so much time on that.</v>

773
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

774
00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.790
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look what they've done to build.</v>

775
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:19.170
<v Speaker 2>I want to say why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't Ben Afleck play the parts of</v>

776
00:42:19.171 --> 00:42:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed the grade or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

777
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.970
<v Speaker 1>That would be something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

778
00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 1>He had no problem playing a fallen angel</v>
<v Speaker 1>in dogma,</v>

779
00:42:25.341 --> 00:42:26.174
<v Speaker 1>which was all about Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess it's a little different in </v>

780
00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 1>this case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

781
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.090
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

782
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:32.923
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the other things when I tweeted </v>

783
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 1>about you was that a couple people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you have her on?</v>

784
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:43.271
<v Speaker 1>She's a neo-con that the urine neo-con </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you neo-con ion.</v>

785
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.593
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody explained to me was an near </v>

786
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Connie's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might decide to be any record or not.</v>

787
00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.670
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

788
00:42:52.671 --> 00:42:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I think what people are saying is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the neocons,</v>

789
00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.600
<v Speaker 1>they really think of the neocons as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of George Bush,</v>

790
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Donald Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Cheney nation builders.</v>

791
00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:07.910
<v Speaker 1>This idea that America can exert its </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence to nation build.</v>

792
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lump you in on that.</v>

793
00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it away.</v>

794
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.963
<v Speaker 2>It's a position in felt foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you are going to intervene and </v>

795
00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you remember right after 9:11,</v>

796
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we go out to,</v>

797
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.203
<v Speaker 2>as the United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know we've been attacked from </v>

798
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get into the affairs of that country.</v>

799
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 2>How do we leave it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were people who were saying,</v>

800
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:34.754
<v Speaker 2>we don't just go in and destroy and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad guys and get out because we </v>

801
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:43.160
<v Speaker 2>leave the situation far worse than we </v>
<v Speaker 2>found it.</v>

802
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:48.310
<v Speaker 2>We have a responsibility to rebuild and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cost us a lot of blood and</v>

803
00:43:48.921 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 2>treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If those are the neocons,</v>

804
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.793
<v Speaker 2>count me in on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that such a thing is really </v>

805
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:55.034
<v Speaker 2>quite murky and it takes a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find that position to be more </v>

806
00:43:59.121 --> 00:43:59.954
<v Speaker 2>noble than the position we are in now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we're going to go and get rid of </v>

807
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:09.360
<v Speaker 2>the feet and degrade and defeat isis by </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing together people who really have</v>

808
00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:15.941
<v Speaker 2>never fought and have them be defeated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and offer some airpower and just mock it</v>

809
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:17.990
<v Speaker 2>up and muddle through.</v>

810
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.070
<v Speaker 2>When the neocons were in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that is president George W Bush,</v>

811
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.833
<v Speaker 2>he did make huge mistakes early on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after the surge in Iraq was under </v>

812
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:30.200
<v Speaker 2>control and the rats lived in relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>fees,</v>

813
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.123
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have to pull out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are political positions and this </v>

814
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.453
<v Speaker 2>is policy and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you like about the marriage of </v>

815
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:41.850
<v Speaker 2>the policy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it is wrong to put labels on</v>

816
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:45.060
<v Speaker 2>their foreheads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people as neocons and this and that.</v>

817
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:45.894
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a bunch of people who thought </v>

818
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.460
<v Speaker 2>about what would happen after you leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>

819
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

820
00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.470
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still think it's more responsible once</v>

821
00:44:55.471 --> 00:44:56.304
<v Speaker 2>you invade a place to stay there until </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are in order instead of pulling </v>

822
00:45:00.091 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 2>out two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years into it.</v>

823
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's the irony is that,</v>

824
00:45:04.471 --> 00:45:05.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know in retrospect that the Iraq war </v>

825
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 1>was based on faulty logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>

826
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 1>when we were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was better than it is now.</v>

827
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a sad reality and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean we should be there forever.</v>

828
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.121
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

829
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 1>we look at the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in this weird thing,</v>

830
00:45:20.371 --> 00:45:21.600
<v Speaker 1>we do things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people hate us,</v>

831
00:45:21.601 --> 00:45:23.370
<v Speaker 1>we don't do things and look what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening now.</v>

832
00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that gets you right.</v>

833
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:26.783
<v Speaker 1>They hate us anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that gets your point about </v>

834
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 1>labels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

835
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.120
<v Speaker 2>It's also about policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in,</v>

836
00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:37.130
<v Speaker 2>and maybe I can't blame it for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who haven't been,</v>

837
00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in parliamentary,</v>

838
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:40.580
<v Speaker 2>in poly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever want to involved in policy,</v>

839
00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.690
<v Speaker 2>every single policy has consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intended consequences,</v>

840
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.490
<v Speaker 2>unintended consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you name it.</v>

841
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.563
<v Speaker 2>So it's all about the positions you take</v>
<v Speaker 2>around these policy issues in the </v>

842
00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:51.973
<v Speaker 2>position you take around a policy issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>should not define who you are and I </v>

843
00:45:56.541 --> 00:45:57.374
<v Speaker 2>think people who then start coming up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with these names of neo-con this and </v>

844
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:03.043
<v Speaker 2>take it from the policy to the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are from their militias and the </v>

845
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:07.254
<v Speaker 2>acting in bad faith.</v>

846
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the part of that that particularly </v>

847
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 1>bothers me is that they think if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can label you with that or whatever that</v>

848
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:14.184
<v Speaker 1>label is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then they can extrapolate every </v>

849
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:16.554
<v Speaker 1>other idea that you think and they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they understand every other decision </v>

850
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:23.160
<v Speaker 1>that you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you so rarely the case.</v>

851
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:23.994
<v Speaker 1>Many of us believe in many conflicting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things or have liberal values and </v>

852
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:29.040
<v Speaker 1>libertarian values and so on</v>

853
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.920
<v Speaker 2>that plus they also distract the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses of their policy position.</v>

854
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's all about not having to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>the merits and demerits.</v>

855
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:39.623
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if my opponent's position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I discussed the letter and I know </v>

856
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:44.550
<v Speaker 2>that they'll have weaknesses and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>have strengths,</v>

857
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:45.623
<v Speaker 2>but in order to discuss the policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>position to polish the proposal of the </v>

858
00:46:48.001 --> 00:46:50.280
<v Speaker 2>other person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never call him this or that.</v>

859
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.710
<v Speaker 2>It has to be about the policy.</v>

860
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it'd be your,</v>

861
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.413
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would refer to as a true liberal </v>

862
00:46:56.441 --> 00:46:57.274
<v Speaker 1>and willing to debate the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know we only have about 10 minutes </v>

863
00:46:59.381 --> 00:47:02.410
<v Speaker 1>left and I wanted to discuss one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you because I saw you.</v>

864
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:03.543
<v Speaker 1>I was probably about six months ago now </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the daily show when Jon Stewart was </v>

865
00:47:06.821 --> 00:47:10.330
<v Speaker 1>still there and I interned at the daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>show in 1999.</v>

866
00:47:10.331 --> 00:47:11.350
<v Speaker 1>John is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

867
00:47:11.351 --> 00:47:12.184
<v Speaker 1>we've met a couple of times and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>given me some great advice about comedy </v>

868
00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and life and I love John just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else loves John.</v>

869
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:18.363
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought his interview with you was </v>

870
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.633
<v Speaker 1>really terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought every time you brought up </v>

871
00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:26.284
<v Speaker 1>something about Islam again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from the history that you come </v>

872
00:47:28.721 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your life,</v>

873
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 1>your firsthand experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you said something,</v>

874
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 1>he immediately brought it back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>

875
00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.080
<v Speaker 1>He immediately said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

876
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Christianity did this stuff and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on Islam and I,</v>

877
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:44.770
<v Speaker 1>and it really was that regressive thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we started this conversation about.</v>

878
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a,</v>

879
00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:50.170
<v Speaker 1>do you agree that it was a sort of messy</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview a and B,</v>

880
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:51.810
<v Speaker 1>were you shocked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

881
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:52.803
<v Speaker 1>I would think everything being equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would sit down with this guy </v>

882
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:55.984
<v Speaker 1>and he would absolutely love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stand for every liberal value and </v>

883
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 1>women's rights and equality and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

884
00:48:00.641 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was really terrible.</v>

885
00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.770
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely wasn't funny.</v>

886
00:48:07.771 --> 00:48:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

887
00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Isn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't funny.</v>

888
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:11.303
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why it wasn't funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was probably because it was about </v>

889
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Islam and Islam is not funny at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

890
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:18.923
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speculate on what the see what </v>

891
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:23.850
<v Speaker 2>somebody work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

892
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 2>imagine if the next morning he gets a </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat,</v>

893
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.480
<v Speaker 2>he gets whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

894
00:48:30.481 --> 00:48:33.120
<v Speaker 2>people telling him that he hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated them fairly.</v>

895
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.330
<v Speaker 2>You can't laugh at Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing funny.</v>

896
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:36.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

897
00:48:36.211 --> 00:48:37.044
<v Speaker 2>I can make a lot of comedy about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absurdities of Islam and all the sad </v>

898
00:48:41.401 --> 00:48:43.110
<v Speaker 2>things that are done in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

899
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:48.440
<v Speaker 2>but nowadays that comes laced with </v>
<v Speaker 2>threats laced with resentment.</v>

900
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.370
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't a funny show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

901
00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

902
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean in hindsight I asked myself why </v>
<v Speaker 2>he even agreed to it.</v>

903
00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

904
00:48:57.941 --> 00:48:59.360
<v Speaker 2>it is for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

905
00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.223
<v Speaker 2>he's an adult and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will probably have his own </v>

906
00:49:02.791 --> 00:49:04.430
<v Speaker 2>explanations in his own lesson.</v>

907
00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

908
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:05.973
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that saying anything negative or </v>

909
00:49:07.441 --> 00:49:10.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever about John is not going to win </v>
<v Speaker 1>me any Brownie points,</v>

910
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.333
<v Speaker 1>but I thought that because not only was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tone of it unnecessarily combative </v>

911
00:49:14.611 --> 00:49:18.330
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to just listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then at the end he said something to</v>

912
00:49:18.331 --> 00:49:20.520
<v Speaker 1>the effect as he was saying goodbye to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

913
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:21.740
<v Speaker 1>like basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

914
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.583
<v Speaker 1>you just want to sell some books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really thought it was just </v>

915
00:49:24.451 --> 00:49:25.284
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dismissive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you kept your calm and </v>

916
00:49:27.031 --> 00:49:27.864
<v Speaker 1>your cool and all of that.</v>

917
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:28.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's funny because people go to John </v>

918
00:49:30.141 --> 00:49:30.974
<v Speaker 2>who had books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sell books and sell a bunch of </v>

919
00:49:34.701 --> 00:49:35.780
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is,</v>

920
00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:36.614
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what he did it to a certain </v>

921
00:49:38.061 --> 00:49:43.061
<v Speaker 2>degree was put himself in the shoes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my opponents and in doing so,</v>

922
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.983
<v Speaker 2>I think the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he entertained a thought that this is </v>

923
00:49:47.691 --> 00:49:49.130
<v Speaker 2>not entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not funny.</v>

924
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

925
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

926
00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the west view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can give comedia.</v>

927
00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

928
00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:56.331
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

929
00:49:56.331 --> 00:49:57.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have one more for you,</v>

930
00:49:57.451 --> 00:50:00.150
<v Speaker 1>that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to try to tie this altogether.</v>

931
00:50:00.151 --> 00:50:01.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

932
00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you alluded to security threats that,</v>

933
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.280
<v Speaker 1>that you still have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

934
00:50:05.281 --> 00:50:07.170
<v Speaker 1>your life story as we've said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

935
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just incredible and an inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

936
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gimme something to end this,</v>

937
00:50:12.481 --> 00:50:16.430
<v Speaker 1>that we can all feel good about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction that this is going.</v>

938
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.353
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a little bit about how the </v>

939
00:50:18.271 --> 00:50:19.104
<v Speaker 1>voices are finally raising up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal community against the </v>

940
00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:26.940
<v Speaker 1>regressives and I think a lot of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience take solace in that.</v>

941
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

942
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:28.483
<v Speaker 1>but give me something that you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you've lived through </v>

943
00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.580
<v Speaker 1>that you can really help us all take </v>
<v Speaker 1>with us and feel good and feel like,</v>

944
00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:39.230
<v Speaker 1>feel like we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can win for the right reasons and the</v>

945
00:50:39.231 --> 00:50:40.064
<v Speaker 1>right principles.</v>

946
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:41.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the best news I have at the </v>

947
00:50:42.361 --> 00:50:43.194
<v Speaker 2>moment is just the sheer number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals who are born into Muslim </v>

948
00:50:47.131 --> 00:50:51.990
<v Speaker 2>households who are rejecting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute is submission narrative.</v>

949
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:52.873
<v Speaker 2>He was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I don't like it if it comes to </v>

950
00:50:56.101 --> 00:50:59.760
<v Speaker 2>choosing between my conscience and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed tells me to do.</v>

951
00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I go with my conscience and people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying with their lives.</v>

952
00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about as much as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a battery in Saudi Arabia of all.</v>

953
00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine living in Saudi Arabia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and somehow finding the intellectually,</v>

954
00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.493
<v Speaker 2>the capacity to say no to all this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up for a message of freedom and </v>

955
00:51:22.561 --> 00:51:23.394
<v Speaker 2>rationality and reason and science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then having to deal with the </v>

956
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:26.874
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This man is sentenced to a thousand </v>

957
00:51:28.201 --> 00:51:29.940
<v Speaker 2>lashes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 of them have been carried out,</v>

958
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:34.560
<v Speaker 2>is fighting for his life inside prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he is an icon,</v>

959
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:36.263
<v Speaker 2>but he's only one of what I now see as </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and I see them everywhere </v>

960
00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:44.460
<v Speaker 2>because the emails I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so heartened by that,</v>

961
00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:49.060
<v Speaker 2>and 10 years ago it was the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single Muslim who called me,</v>

962
00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.940
<v Speaker 2>he just called me an infidel and told </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

963
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.230
<v Speaker 2>you deserve to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now people are saying,</v>

964
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.810
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

965
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.970
<v Speaker 2>You're my hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in this together.</v>

966
00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.400
<v Speaker 2>And some of them still identify as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim.</v>

967
00:51:59.401 --> 00:52:01.980
<v Speaker 2>They're not necessarily out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are.</v>

968
00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:06.510
<v Speaker 2>They're thinking and you and me and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other liberals,</v>

969
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:10.590
<v Speaker 2>the one thing we can advance is the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of critical thinking.</v>

970
00:52:10.591 --> 00:52:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Let's just give people whether they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim or not,</v>

971
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:14.903
<v Speaker 2>the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just enhance their ability to </v>

972
00:52:18.121 --> 00:52:19.860
<v Speaker 2>think critically about these things.</v>

973
00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

974
00:52:21.491 --> 00:52:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

975
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:22.703
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much what I've tried to </v>

976
00:52:23.771 --> 00:52:25.610
<v Speaker 1>now make my life about and it's clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

977
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:26.703
<v Speaker 1>what you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really this has been truly a thrill </v>

978
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.580
<v Speaker 1>to spend a little time with you and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>

00:52:32.861 --> 00:52:35.260
<v Speaker 1>but I hope we can do it in person next </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
