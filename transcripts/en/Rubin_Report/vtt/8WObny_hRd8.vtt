1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.983
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if you heard about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the 2016 election was completely </v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>been at as trump and hillary were </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the only part of it,</v>

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>as there were other characters from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie and Jeb to Marco and Ted.</v>

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.723
<v Speaker 1>The election also caused the implosion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mainstream media and set us on a </v>

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:19.761
<v Speaker 1>path that has hashtag Maga racing </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards hashtag resistance with the rest</v>

6
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>of us caught right in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio governor John Casick was one of the</v>

7
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>more moderate voices in a campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>season that we're short on moderation.</v>

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>As a fiscally conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially liberal Republican.</v>

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I see casick as someone who has some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right ideas,</v>

10
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>but who's timing just wasn't right for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the madness of 2016 cases.</v>

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Team reached out to us a couple days ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have him in studio today,</v>

12
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:44.904
<v Speaker 1>totally unscripted and unedited with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced knowledge of the topics or </v>

13
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:49.644
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is exactly the way we need </v>

14
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>to be hearing from our politicians and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope that this interview helps dls in on</v>

15
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>these conversations in the near future.</v>

16
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Joining me today is the author of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>new book,</v>

17
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 2>two pads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America divided or united,</v>

18
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 2>a former Republican presidential </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate,</v>

19
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 2>and the current governor of the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of Ohio,</v>

20
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Governor John Casick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Gets a really good television voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that?</v>

22
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just sitting here.</v>

23
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 2>You were kind of normal and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

24
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.173
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

25
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 2>it was like Ted Baxter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

26
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Baxter.</v>

27
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I like the reference that did not go </v>
<v Speaker 2>over me.</v>

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course everybody else watching,</v>

30
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 2>they don't know who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>

31
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:32.274
<v Speaker 2>They could google it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of my millennial people won't get </v>

32
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:35.004
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they should google who ted Baxter </v>

33
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>

34
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 2>that would be good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

35
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first one I wanted to start with you.</v>

36
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm incredibly excited you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting because your people</v>

37
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 2>reached out to us about four days ago.</v>

38
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 2>They said the governor would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in and then we quickly set this up.</v>

39
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Nobody said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

40
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 2>we have to talk about this or we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about this.</v>

41
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.963
<v Speaker 2>You sat down here about two minutes ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you said whatever you want to do is </v>

42
00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:57.984
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like that is partly what's </v>

43
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 2>lost in politics right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to just do this.</v>

44
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not just lost in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it lost in a lot of things.</v>

45
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met with this big car company and like</v>

46
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.404
<v Speaker 2>they had these guys come in to see me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like they were totally </v>

47
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>scripted and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.163
<v Speaker 2>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 2>life is having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is,</v>

50
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to be real.</v>

51
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why we wanted to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is I actually kind of saw part of one of</v>

52
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 2>your shows and this media is a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

53
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.443
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't get it and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to get it and I have some </v>

54
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 2>people around me who say this is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way to keep your voice out there.</v>

55
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:41.964
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want to be able to have a </v>

56
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 2>constructive positive voice to help our </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

57
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 2>And this is another avenue that I'm glad</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one else has found it yet.</v>

58
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 2>In my profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can be a first mover,</v>

59
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

60
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.373
<v Speaker 2>I really like and I liked the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can actually have a conversation </v>

61
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.363
<v Speaker 2>longer than just a couple soundbites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever worry that because we've </v>

62
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.284
<v Speaker 2>lost the ability to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the soundbite world is what's </v>

63
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.530
<v Speaker 2>causing so many of the problems?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

64
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 2>that was what happened in the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all,</v>

65
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.334
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't do it but these other </v>

66
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 2>campaigns and I had advice from some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who had run before,</v>

67
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.153
<v Speaker 2>make sure you get your little thing out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there so you can blow up the television </v>

68
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 2>morning news and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like tricks,</v>

69
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good thing.</v>

70
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 2>And I look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I saw,</v>

71
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I saw a thing on a sign yesterday had </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

72
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>email me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

73
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 2>we have to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

74
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look I,</v>

75
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a smartphone for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

76
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.204
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had an ipad and I got to the very </v>

77
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.694
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't have a smartphone and </v>

78
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.563
<v Speaker 2>people would laugh at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't need this stuff during the </v>

79
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.283
<v Speaker 2>I didn't need to have basketball scores </v>
<v Speaker 2>or look at the weather 25 times or some </v>

81
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.390
<v Speaker 2>kind of headline in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

82
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
<v Speaker 2>or my emails because I have people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell me if there's a crisis.</v>

83
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:08.231
<v Speaker 2>They tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

84
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's see what it is.</v>

85
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got my smartphone and now the best</v>

86
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 2>thing about it is that I can text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find that I text,</v>

87
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it does is it creates a laziness,</v>

88
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

89
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to go through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation now,</v>

90
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

91
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 2>you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a show here where people talk.</v>

92
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think this is a problem?</v>

93
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.533
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that resetting our ability to </v>

94
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:34.864
<v Speaker 2>talk and actually think and sit across </v>
<v Speaker 2>from somebody and make some eye contact </v>

95
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 2>and really try to understand what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

96
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.704
<v Speaker 2>I think that is almost the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing that we'd given up and </v>

97
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:45.694
<v Speaker 2>these last couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the tradeoff between all these </v>

98
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:49.820
<v Speaker 2>devices and the immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.010
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do we do about this?</v>

100
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

101
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.663
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think that you come in here </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and your people being brave </v>

102
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 2>enough to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

103
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I have people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 2>these are people that work around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of support me and help me.</v>

105
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 2>They're friends and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this whole,</v>

106
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of funny.</v>

107
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.574
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go on these shows on regular </v>

108
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 2>television which I think are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important and you get,</v>

109
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2 million people to see you.</v>

110
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 2>But if you were like hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Logan,</v>

111
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Paul got 16 million subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

112
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.453
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing about it is that people </v>

113
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:27.874
<v Speaker 2>can't see it really now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really true because I </v>

114
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 2>think probably you're in demand now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go out and make talks and people</v>

115
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:36.780
<v Speaker 2>show up to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

116
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.683
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of an invisible world to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those who were kind of hooked on </v>

117
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 2>You under stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean by that?</v>

119
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do we,</v>

120
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 2>how do we bridge that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

121
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 2>but I gave you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

122
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 2>what's I think it's called what's news?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really fantastic and there were a</v>

123
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 2>couple of million views and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I liked it.</v>

124
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have to keep doing it.</v>

125
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>It's part of why I wanted to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

126
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pull up here,</v>

127
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 2>you got a studio in your garage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

128
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>

129
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.750
<v Speaker 2>It's neat and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to go very far.</v>

130
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.603
<v Speaker 2>My Commute's about 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the hard thing is got to be getting </v>

131
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.514
<v Speaker 2>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess that's got to be a hard thing to </v>

132
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you go about doing that?</v>

133
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately a lot of people are coming</v>

134
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>to this medium now and a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests that you asked me right before we</v>

135
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 2>started all these books here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean most of the,</v>

136
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I think virtually every single one </v>
<v Speaker 2>except the Carl Sagan book.</v>

137
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>Are there any of them that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

138
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 2>boring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know.</v>

139
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:31.664
<v Speaker 2>There's some great books there by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by many of my guests from Steven pinker </v>

140
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:37.720
<v Speaker 2>and Sam Harris and Scott Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and plenty of ice.</v>

141
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Speaker 2>You have one here on John Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's good.</v>

142
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 2>We did a president's week a couple weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

143
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 2>John Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting,</v>

144
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 2>you're getting good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People of color were getting,</v>

145
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 2>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

146
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:51.611
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times when I am with press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually curious about them and they</v>

147
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 2>don't like it when I'm asking them </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

148
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must've,</v>

149
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 2>it must've been hard in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

150
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.530
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to build anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

151
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

152
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.094
<v Speaker 2>But I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I consistently </v>

153
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 2>tell my audience is it's cool that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the beliefs that I have,</v>

154
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.691
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I fall a little more within classical </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism and libertarianism,</v>

156
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.913
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the beliefs about doing things </v>
<v Speaker 2>for yourself and I've built this </v>

157
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 2>business with the same ideas that I try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about here.</v>

158
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which I think we're going to get</v>

159
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:18.344
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of a beautiful thing if I </v>

160
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 2>keep.</v>

161
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not if you keep going.</v>

162
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.383
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you a couple of questions as </v>

163
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.224
<v Speaker 2>long as you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought just first I thought we </v>

164
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 2>them just a little bit about growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of family you grew up in.</v>

165
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 2>I feel like people never do that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics anymore.</v>

166
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.453
<v Speaker 2>We go to immediately mocks me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>say my father was a mailman and so the </v>

167
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 2>people write that in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cynical and all that.</v>

168
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 2>But I grew up in a towel and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

169
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever met a Republican.</v>

170
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Not In my town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My uncle Harry was a republican.</v>

171
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 2>They say we didn't listen much to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy,</v>

172
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:54.240
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was blue collar and you know,</v>

173
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.570
<v Speaker 2>was sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these people you would define is</v>

174
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Kinda the trump people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who felt they had been left behind.</v>

175
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 2>as a result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's why I'm a populist,</v>

177
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 2>but a positive populace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a negative populist positive that we</v>

178
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 2>can do what we can together we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can rise.</v>

179
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.723
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

180
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 2>that's a great place to come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you really have a sense,</v>

181
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 2>you have a sense of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

182
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:23.450
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just the upper crust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

183
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.583
<v Speaker 2>we respected the upper crust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can remember saying to my father one </v>

184
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>

185
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 2>what about the rich?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

186
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't hate the rich.</v>

187
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 2>We want to be the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

188
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 2>And so it was great God fearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative Democrat,</v>

189
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.840
<v Speaker 2>good values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faith was a,</v>

190
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.213
<v Speaker 2>was a part of my early childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I normally drifted away from when </v>

191
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

192
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 2>so like Augustine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

193
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>

194
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I know I need to be committed to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just not right now.</v>

195
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of parties to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

196
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all drifted away and I've not </v>

197
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 2>drifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've come roaring back into that.</v>

198
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 2>But common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

199
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.473
<v Speaker 2>A freewheeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it puts people off a little </v>

200
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 2>bit the way I am because I'm pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct.</v>

201
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.503
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing is I was telling </v>

202
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 2>somebody the other day that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to be confused about</v>
<v Speaker 2>my positions on anything.</v>

204
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 2>And so if somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

205
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I might say,</v>

206
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's red.</v>

207
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people would expect me to say,</v>

208
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll consider that.</v>

209
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

210
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that.</v>

211
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think to some degree people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>

212
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 2>So it takes a little bit of time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to come to understand me.</v>

213
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:37.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

214
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:39.190
<v Speaker 2>well that's what we're going to do here </v>
<v Speaker 2>for now.</v>

215
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned a couple of interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>things there.</v>

216
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:42.474
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't grow up in a Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>family and you just used the phrase </v>

217
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.504
<v Speaker 2>conservative Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I talk a lot about </v>

218
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:48.744
<v Speaker 2>here is that it seems to me before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into your party that the </v>

219
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:52.254
<v Speaker 2>conservative Democrat or the blue dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>democrat or sort of the moderate </v>

220
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:55.944
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them were buddies of mine in </v>

221
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great friends.</v>

222
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Do they really exist anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is,</v>

223
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I think this young man in Pennsylvania </v>
<v Speaker 2>is blue dog Democrat from what I can see</v>

224
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.610
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got elected at 33,</v>

225
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.060
<v Speaker 2>I think I was 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's kind of an old timer.</v>

226
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

227
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 2>I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in both parties it's really hard</v>

228
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:17.784
<v Speaker 2>if you're a republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a fear of the right and if </v>

229
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:22.050
<v Speaker 2>you're a Democrat you fear the left and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it just pulls everybody apart.</v>

230
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 2>You know that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

231
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:24.114
<v Speaker 2>but you've managed to kind of work </v>
<v Speaker 2>through something that's sort of </v>

232
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.613
<v Speaker 2>centrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

233
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

234
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

235
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.520
<v Speaker 2>one guy once told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that goes down the middle</v>

236
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 2>of a road are yellow lines and dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>skunks.</v>

237
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

238
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a,</v>

239
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a common sense person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

240
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I guess I look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at an issue and say,</v>

241
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do about it?</v>

242
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 2>And we look at a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we fix the problem?</v>

243
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.670
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not really going to have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological.</v>

244
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm forced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kept pulling me back.</v>

245
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:57.444
<v Speaker 2>But the same time being a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what the solutions are </v>

246
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Speaker 2>without having to bring bureaucracy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>government in.</v>

247
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.773
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because government inherently a is </v>

248
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.053
<v Speaker 2>so subject to political considerations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people have a hard time make </v>

249
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 2>calling a spade a spade.</v>

250
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

251
00:11:19.551 --> 00:11:20.384
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got all these pressures and I don't </v>

252
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you go to government you can</v>

253
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:27.840
<v Speaker 2>get trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get trapped with big business to</v>

254
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:28.531
<v Speaker 2>big business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

255
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 2>you try to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need this prescription,</v>

256
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody out here is telling me,</v>

257
00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:33.451
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

258
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 2>it costs too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.320
<v Speaker 2>big things like that all have always </v>
<v Speaker 2>bothered me,</v>

260
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big institutions,</v>

261
00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:40.280
<v Speaker 2>whether it's government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

262
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up,</v>

263
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 2>my dad was in a union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always like unions,</v>

264
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:44.544
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with the unions is when the </v>

265
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:50.541
<v Speaker 2>union boss not representing the worker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm so big,</v>

266
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:52.530
<v Speaker 2>institutions don't throw me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where am I?</v>

267
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Kind of unpredictable because you kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of labeled yourself a little bit ago.</v>

268
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm this and that.</v>

269
00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 2>If you asked me what I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say I'm a conservative,</v>

270
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 2>but then you will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

271
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 2>but why do you think this or that?</v>

272
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.173
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think we need to be </v>

273
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.604
<v Speaker 2>stuck right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being stuck in life is really </v>

274
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 2>depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

275
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:11.704
<v Speaker 2>so tell me about what does being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative basically mean to you then </v>

276
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.271
<v Speaker 2>if they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

277
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 2>government is government as a last </v>
<v Speaker 2>resort,</v>

278
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 2>not as a first resort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

279
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 2>but I also don't think it's like no </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

280
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you decide where that you use </v>

281
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.383
<v Speaker 2>your judgment and you list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have good people around and you </v>

282
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:34.711
<v Speaker 2>think about things and we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>price something right now in our state.</v>

283
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Somebody wants access to stuff in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

284
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>

285
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good thing what they want,</v>

286
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what the price of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>value of it is.</v>

287
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can't just look at what governments</v>

288
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 2>have done to determine the value because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have.</v>

289
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a whole lot of.</v>

290
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't invest a lot in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

291
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I want to go out and talk to a variety </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people in business to say,</v>

292
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 2>what do you think this is worth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

293
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do I do that?</v>

294
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 2>People that come in and they talk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they argue for certain things,</v>

295
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 2>but at the end I have to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just use good judgment as I can.</v>

296
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.153
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a certain leeway when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to sort of thinking for yourself </v>

297
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:22.534
<v Speaker 2>as a governor that may be the senators </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the congressmen can't have because </v>

298
00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 2>they have to all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that you don't have to come together</v>

299
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 2>and work with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have to do it from,</v>

300
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 2>with people outside of their state with </v>
<v Speaker 2>massively competing interests and things</v>

301
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:34.924
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was offering budgets against </v>

302
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Republican presidents.</v>

303
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do your job.</v>

304
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to be.</v>

305
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to have a television </v>
<v Speaker 2>show where you don't make it real?</v>

306
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Why would I want to be in politics no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter where I am and not make it real?</v>

307
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would I be there for?</v>

308
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.590
<v Speaker 2>It's really stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

309
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.573
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people there I don't </v>

310
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:01.450
<v Speaker 2>want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be casting aspersions or</v>

311
00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 2>judging them only for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you do that?</v>

312
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.483
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had a decision on Medicaid </v>

313
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 2>expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

314
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.670
<v Speaker 2>In Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>

315
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Medicaid expansion,</v>

316
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.853
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

317
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 2>So I just really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jan Brewer and Arizona did it,</v>

318
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 2>which really was kind of shocking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was really the first big state,</v>

319
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:25.330
<v Speaker 2>big Republican governor who expand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it hard?</v>

320
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Was a piece of cake.</v>

321
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.383
<v Speaker 2>If I'm going to get money that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to put me in a straight jacket </v>

322
00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:35.080
<v Speaker 2>from the federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can use that money to heal,</v>

323
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.943
<v Speaker 2>to help heal or help help to help the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally ill so they're not sleeping </v>

324
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:41.794
<v Speaker 2>under a bridge or living in a jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if I can help people who have drug </v>

325
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:47.770
<v Speaker 2>addiction to get treatment and get off </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

326
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.250
<v Speaker 2>if I can have a lower uninsurance rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't I do that?</v>

327
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 2>And because people are going to yell at </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and fight with,</v>

328
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

329
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean I care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to not,</v>

330
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to be anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

331
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:03.614
<v Speaker 2>in my state of the state address I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a talk that really had almost </v>

332
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:07.184
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll had all to do with basically </v>

333
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>philosophy and the meaning of life.</v>

334
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.043
<v Speaker 2>They say it was the only state of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state speech delivered by a governor in </v>

335
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>the history of the world where the name </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cammo was discussed.</v>

336
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

337
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:19.874
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't mention that because I </v>

338
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 2>don't want to jab anybody in the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the decision to do that,</v>

339
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.630
<v Speaker 2>to help people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

340
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.613
<v Speaker 2>it's such an easy decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find you have a little bit of </v>

341
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.883
<v Speaker 2>extra freedom right now because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't run for reelection and Ohio now </v>

342
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of talk at 2020,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I want to end the interview.</v>

343
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:37.724
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

344
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've always been very independent.</v>

345
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a military reformer.</v>

346
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I was offering my own budgets against </v>
<v Speaker 2>President Bush.</v>

347
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:52.973
<v Speaker 2>I took on corporate welfare reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't find a Democrat with a search </v>

348
00:15:57.561 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Republicans ran the other way.</v>

349
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

350
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always pretty well felt that,</v>

351
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta do what you have to do and uh,</v>

352
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 2>and my more free now and maybe a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit but,</v>

353
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:12.860
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

354
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 2>nothing would change.</v>

355
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

356
00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 2>what is it I would reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say,</v>

357
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:17.864
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to do this medicaid </v>

358
00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 2>thing now if it got us into point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were fiscally at risk,</v>

359
00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I would have to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've told everybody that,</v>

360
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.260
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think so.</v>

361
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.310
<v Speaker 2>But I am having probably more fun now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

362
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.243
<v Speaker 2>having a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can tell that I've been having </v>

363
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:34.011
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

364
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:34.844
<v Speaker 2>I ran for reelection and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I never even used the word Obama </v>

365
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 2>running for reelection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never talked about it.</v>

366
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I just talked about our record and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was fun and it was positive.</v>

367
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

368
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.353
<v Speaker 2>and we all need to know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all need to be healers in one way or </v>

369
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:52.694
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to heal our family and our </v>

370
00:16:55.821 --> 00:17:00.200
<v Speaker 2>friends and strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that great a guy.</v>

371
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.033
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know that that makes sense and I </v>

372
00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:07.040
<v Speaker 2>know that it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a cool thing to think about</v>

373
00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:10.370
<v Speaker 2>and that's why politics is so boring to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me because it's all these,</v>

374
00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>all these calculations and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>crap.</v>

375
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.483
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we just do a job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's think about how to pull to pull </v>

376
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:16.904
<v Speaker 2>the country together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make sure that we can help people </v>

377
00:17:18.561 --> 00:17:21.110
<v Speaker 2>to be lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not tear somebody down.</v>

378
00:17:21.111 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth Warren wants to tear down all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these rich people.</v>

379
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Bernie or whatever.</v>

380
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I used to work with Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

381
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.930
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to tear people down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to just build people up and,</v>

382
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.940
<v Speaker 2>and put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever get into any of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical discussions with Bernie?</v>

384
00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Because the class war thing I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see as extremely dangerous.</v>

385
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.623
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a conversation with Bernie </v>

386
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 2>had been burning and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a house together.</v>

387
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.610
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 2>really kind of in another orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all thought he was.</v>

389
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.001
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 2>the country's kind of moved towards him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of young people are,</v>

391
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:56.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that is concerning to me </v>

392
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.660
<v Speaker 2>and I have great faith in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials and the gen x,</v>

393
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.293
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sure they understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of losing a representative </v>

394
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:12.870
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be with some of them,</v>

395
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:15.880
<v Speaker 2>some appeal towards an authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure.</v>

396
00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I right on that?</v>

397
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to tell me I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>studied it,</v>

398
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:23.190
<v Speaker 2>but I've got that sense that's not good </v>
<v Speaker 2>or that you know,</v>

399
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe socialism will work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look and free enterprise system.</v>

400
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Michael Novak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great philosopher,</v>

401
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.523
<v Speaker 2>theologian said that a free market </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that is not underlaid with a set </v>

402
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:38.550
<v Speaker 2>of values is bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to have values.</v>

403
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.670
<v Speaker 2>You can't just be in it to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has to be something else there.</v>

404
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think those values come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>

405
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they.</v>

406
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.243
<v Speaker 2>I think that they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The easy thing to say politically easy </v>

407
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 2>thing to say as they come from mom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad and I say to people,</v>

408
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:55.194
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you think mom and dad got it </v>

409
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:57.730
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

410
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.583
<v Speaker 2>they got it from their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do I think these virtues come </v>

411
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

412
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 2>if you're a humanist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect you.</v>

413
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

414
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.483
<v Speaker 2>you wake up every day trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to make the world a little </v>

415
00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 2>better place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

416
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>

417
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.330
<v Speaker 2>the winds of change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fads can knock me off my path.</v>

418
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.703
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

419
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.673
<v Speaker 2>I need something deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I look to theologians and I believe </v>

420
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 2>that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are a unique form of life,</v>

421
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.350
<v Speaker 2>greater than all other life on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>

422
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Speaker 2>and I think that life has given to us by</v>
<v Speaker 2>our creator.</v>

423
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:35.723
<v Speaker 2>And I think our creator has a character </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can learn about and that's not </v>

424
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 2>only held by a Christian but also a Jew </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also a Muslim.</v>

425
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:44.544
<v Speaker 2>We have the same kind of view of </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation and our purpose and within </v>

426
00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:53.781
<v Speaker 2>those values are things like mercy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice and compassion and forgiveness.</v>

427
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:57.060
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

428
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:57.923
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you played golf that we </v>

429
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:02.550
<v Speaker 2>see we have to have mulligans in life </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we know and I,</v>

430
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 2>and the danger of talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things is that people want to say,</v>

431
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:07.171
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

432
00:20:07.171 --> 00:20:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you don't have great values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I caught you.</v>

433
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:09.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

434
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a slob on a bus trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it through life,</v>

435
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of know what I need to do.</v>

436
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.580
<v Speaker 2>So I think that these values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they flow from,</v>

437
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 2>from our creator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think too much in religion today,</v>

438
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:26.640
<v Speaker 2>which has turned off a lot of young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

439
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.893
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually mentoring a young man in </v>

440
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.553
<v Speaker 2>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not about all this judgment we </v>

441
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:36.690
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about hope.</v>

442
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.430
<v Speaker 2>It's about human connectedness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's appealing to people.</v>

443
00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:45.270
<v Speaker 2>And it's what I think is true about </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith and virtue.</v>

444
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not confining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enlarging,</v>

445
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make you smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you bigger.</v>

446
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.110
<v Speaker 2>And today in religion we see a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces that are counter to that.</v>

447
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>And I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

448
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to me because my,</v>

449
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.140
<v Speaker 2>my audience knows that Thomas Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was my favorite,</v>

450
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.820
<v Speaker 2>favorite founder and I go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson memorial often in dc and I try</v>

451
00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 2>to read those big plaques and to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're as relevant now as they were,</v>

452
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 some odd years ago where he talked </v>

453
00:21:11.211 --> 00:21:11.531
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

454
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:12.364
<v Speaker 2>they talk about a creator at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time they're talking about why church </v>

455
00:21:16.061 --> 00:21:17.320
<v Speaker 2>and state have to be separate.</v>

456
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's really to the heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what you're saying.</v>

457
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think first of all,</v>

458
00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:23.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want the government being </v>

459
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 2>involved in religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

460
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 2>we don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want though in a free society.</v>

461
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.224
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom means we have to learn to self </v>

462
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:35.044
<v Speaker 2>govern and if every time we turn around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big thing about facebook now </v>

463
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 2>they didn't self-govern right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can pass all these rules,</v>

464
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys like you and me were met,</v>

465
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:49.360
<v Speaker 2>were born to figure out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the rules.</v>

466
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:50.194
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

467
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 2>I want to be free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're both here,</v>

468
00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.910
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to have freedom,</v>

469
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.990
<v Speaker 2>people have to have self restraint and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the less self restraint we have,</v>

470
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.470
<v Speaker 2>the more the government tries to impose </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and the more they impose things,</v>

471
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 2>the less freedom we have.</v>

472
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.460
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that,</v>

473
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our,</v>

474
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 2>our faith system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

475
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're a humanist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool with me,</v>

476
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 2>that's fine with me because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do good every day.</v>

477
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.343
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't work for me because I get to </v>

478
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.400
<v Speaker 2>knocked off kilter by the culture today </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the winds of change.</v>

479
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.680
<v Speaker 2>But with that system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

480
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.220
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it reinforces the sense of freedom.</v>

481
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've referenced culture a couple times</v>

482
00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:33.814
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that seem pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious from an outside perspective of </v>

483
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.540
<v Speaker 2>the 2016 election was that trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>captured the culture,</v>

484
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.370
<v Speaker 2>good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He captured that.</v>

485
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:46.720
<v Speaker 2>He captured the Internet culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason that you're on.</v>

486
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 2>And I was like 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>votes,</v>

487
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:51.310
<v Speaker 2>so we have to keep it in perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is,</v>

488
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.310
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a negative populist.</v>

489
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm a positive populist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that I grew up with,</v>

490
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.570
<v Speaker 2>when they're out at work or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my message is,</v>

491
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.540
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's go fix it.</v>

492
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I think the negative populous messages </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're out of work,</v>

493
00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 2>because that guy over there took it away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from you.</v>

494
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:13.933
<v Speaker 2>He took your stuff away and that creates</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bitterness and an anger and there's </v>

495
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:21.400
<v Speaker 2>also a sense that that can translate </v>
<v Speaker 2>into victim hood.</v>

496
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever like to be a victim?</v>

497
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.050
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not want to be a big no,</v>

498
00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's easy to be a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think?</v>

499
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.003
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's particularly if you have other </v>

500
00:23:30.971 --> 00:23:35.740
<v Speaker 2>people around that want to be a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not going to condemn them,</v>

501
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.833
<v Speaker 2>but it's easy to fall into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody tells you you don't have </v>

502
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:45.350
<v Speaker 2>something because somebody else took it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we need to do is,</v>

503
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:47.630
<v Speaker 2>if you were to go to say Youngstown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ohio,</v>

504
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:49.490
<v Speaker 2>they talk about that a lot in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>national news.</v>

505
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And I was a steel worker.</v>

506
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.643
<v Speaker 2>I worked in a coal mine in West Virginia</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever we have in Ohio working </v>

507
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

508
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 2>with one of the tech companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a list of all the job openings.</v>

509
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.881
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

510
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:05.640
<v Speaker 2>if you're a victim and I come to you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say you are a coal miner or your steel</v>

511
00:24:05.641 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 2>worker and this would be hard for me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

512
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I can show you this Internet stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

513
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.390
<v Speaker 2>And I can get you one of these jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to become an expert,</v>

514
00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:16.700
<v Speaker 2>but I can show you stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm a victim,</v>

515
00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I may not want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I,</v>

516
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 2>if I give that person a message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

517
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.800
<v Speaker 2>look at these jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It pays good money.</v>

518
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Your family will be healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help will be healthier,</v>

519
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:31.280
<v Speaker 2>your children will be healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will have more self respect,</v>

520
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough where you are.</v>

521
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I under that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the better message than,</v>

522
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:37.723
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just a victim and we're going to </v>

523
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 2>go and punish people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

524
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.263
<v Speaker 2>That's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work for the good for the </v>

525
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 2>mental health of our society.</v>

526
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that's a great phrase right </v>

527
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:50.520
<v Speaker 1>there because we seem to be in a mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

528
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Came up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

529
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you write that down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can go back and hey,</v>

530
00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 1>roll the tape back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to do that on television.</v>

531
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Roll it today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could say we're long past their tape.</v>

532
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 1>There's no tape anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all digital.</v>

533
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but negative populate the electrons back</v>

534
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

535
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.070
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So negative populism.</v>

536
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:13.904
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that train coming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems to me that trump </v>

537
00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:17.834
<v Speaker 1>grabbed it.</v>

538
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Istation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>

539
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:22.970
<v Speaker 2>He didn't create this people for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

540
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I felt that the rich get richer and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor get poorer.</v>

541
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.640
<v Speaker 2>People in my party have ignored that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

542
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe to some degree early on I did too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

543
00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that all about?</v>

544
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.443
<v Speaker 2>But it's true that you see these chasms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are dangerous because you </v>

545
00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:39.114
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to believe that all this wealth </v>

546
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:41.714
<v Speaker 2>and everything changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say that the ocean always kind of </v>

547
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.473
<v Speaker 2>flips upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we need to see in our </v>

548
00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>country that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

549
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 2>people in the bottom can get to the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we look and Bayzos guy selling books</v>

550
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:54.440
<v Speaker 2>out of his garage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at you.</v>

551
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of time til you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaire,</v>

552
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

553
00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.013
<v Speaker 1>operating out of this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's delivering me a lot of stuff </v>

555
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.153
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

556
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.130
<v Speaker 2>But you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

557
00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 2>it is possible to rise in a free society</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a free enterprise.</v>

558
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.110
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

559
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.520
<v Speaker 1>do you think we stopped selling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly?</v>

560
00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Because as you don't think we talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

561
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:17.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That young people now they starting to </v>

562
00:26:18.851 --> 00:26:20.050
<v Speaker 1>think that socialism is</v>

563
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.591
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

564
00:26:20.591 --> 00:26:21.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that.</v>

565
00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:22.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

566
00:26:22.391 --> 00:26:23.620
<v Speaker 2>because it sounds good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:26:23.621 --> 00:26:26.260
<v Speaker 2>like let's share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you a really interesting story.</v>

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.260
<v Speaker 2>My chief of staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like they ask questions and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer the,</v>

572
00:26:35.231 --> 00:26:37.300
<v Speaker 2>my kids have done it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't do it anymore.</v>

573
00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the show was called.</v>

574
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well anyway,</v>

575
00:26:41.591 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>she and her kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daughters,</v>

576
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.950
<v Speaker 2>they listened to this every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every night at 9:00</v>

577
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 2>and they work together and so she said </v>
<v Speaker 2>one day to her kids,</v>

578
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.430
<v Speaker 2>why don't I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be on one phone and you got,</v>

579
00:26:53.431 --> 00:26:55.170
<v Speaker 2>you'll be on your phone and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

580
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 2>and joy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be on your phone and let's have a</v>

581
00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They looked at her like she was crazy.</v>

582
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.360
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would we do that?</v>

583
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

584
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

585
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.343
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I'm saying about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of community and together is </v>

586
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:12.054
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want that to erode the </v>

587
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:19.251
<v Speaker 2>basic sense that competition is good as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as it's played fairly and everybody</v>

588
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 2>has a chance to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really what you're talking about,</v>

589
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:22.464
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism and how we can create </v>

590
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 2>groups around that as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>collectivism,</v>

591
00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:28.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

592
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 2>What really the thrust of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write that down.</v>

593
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.690
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one individually rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than collectivism.</v>

594
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

595
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's wrong with that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look there my hope,</v>

596
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.580
<v Speaker 2>because they would rather take a job </v>
<v Speaker 2>that pays less if the job has meaning,</v>

597
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.953
<v Speaker 2>look at what they're doing in Parkland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what these young people are </v>

598
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:51.300
<v Speaker 2>doing across this country and using </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media to,</v>

599
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 2>to have a voice.</v>

600
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really awesome.</v>

601
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:57.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets me really pumped up because the.</v>

602
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I think we need a new era of activism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and citizenship and by the way,</v>

603
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fixate all the time on the leader.</v>

604
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that movie on Churchill?</v>

605
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Darkest Hour?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see it yet.</v>

606
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 2>I just saw the common law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of him in the crowd.</v>

607
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 2>You and Gary Oldman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

608
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I got to get out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on demand now.</v>

609
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving you my word.</v>

610
00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh my word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

611
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

612
00:28:29.821 --> 00:28:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Watching it tonight in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is made up stuff.</v>

613
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 2>He gets on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets,</v>

614
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:41.030
<v Speaker 2>goes down and gets on the subway and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking to people and they're like,</v>

615
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not given in,</v>

616
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:44.550
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

617
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.300
<v Speaker 2>they embolden him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set the fire in him.</v>

618
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

619
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.280
<v Speaker 2>that he wasn't a great leader because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly he was,</v>

620
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.430
<v Speaker 2>but it was a bottom up and top down.</v>

621
00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:57.563
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we think about the civil rights </v>

622
00:28:58.621 --> 00:28:59.550
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

623
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great leaders,</v>

624
00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Martin Luther King,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David,</v>

625
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.010
<v Speaker 2>good help politicians were afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

626
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.800
<v Speaker 2>including JFK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

627
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.280
<v Speaker 2>they were all afraid of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened,</v>

628
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was from the street up,</v>

629
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of social change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

630
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.423
<v Speaker 2>the end of the Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much longer would the generals have </v>

631
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:22.980
<v Speaker 2>said we were winning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

632
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:24.690
<v Speaker 2>look at Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep saying,</v>

633
00:29:24.691 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're victories just around the corner.</v>

634
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

635
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.713
<v Speaker 2>and so you have a situation here where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just expect change in the </v>

636
00:29:35.611 --> 00:29:39.810
<v Speaker 2>country because I have elected a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a new good coach,</v>

637
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 2>so therefore I'm going to win a </v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball game.</v>

638
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works both ways.</v>

639
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:45.424
<v Speaker 2>You a good leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a great group of people that drive </v>

640
00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:49.243
<v Speaker 2>that drive change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dangerous then is that cult of </v>

641
00:29:51.331 --> 00:29:54.040
<v Speaker 2>personality that we've now made around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the president,</v>

642
00:29:54.041 --> 00:29:56.470
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not just saying that trump here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even with Obama and plenty of the</v>

643
00:29:56.471 --> 00:30:00.370
<v Speaker 2>other presidents that we think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow the executive branch is going to</v>

644
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 2>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one person is going to fix it.</v>

645
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.543
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a book that I don't know that </v>

646
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know a lot of things here.</v>

647
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:09.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving you might be over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book is not.</v>

648
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Here is a book that says this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

649
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 2>and I have never talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

650
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Like on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with a,</v>

651
00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:20.500
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great preacher.</v>

652
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 2>A got 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

653
00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:26.890
<v Speaker 2>He's in the Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very grace oriented and hopeful and</v>

654
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:30.210
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a phd in psychology.</v>

655
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 2>He's just got all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this talent.</v>

656
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 2>And I was asking him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

657
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I keep telling people it's bottom up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not top down.</v>

658
00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well John,</v>

659
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:39.364
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because a man wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book and the book says that when pieces </v>

660
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:48.460
<v Speaker 2>of our society start to erode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's think about it.</v>

661
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wells Fargo,</v>

662
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.480
<v Speaker 2>a Equifax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the scandal around,</v>

663
00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:58.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around Volkswagen sports.</v>

664
00:30:58.961 --> 00:30:59.794
<v Speaker 2>You got guys that had brain injuries but</v>
<v Speaker 2>the league is and helping them and </v>

665
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 2>they're living in a car.</v>

666
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Their families are destitute or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood need to say anything.</v>

667
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.333
<v Speaker 2>They're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look across the board and we're </v>

668
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:17.560
<v Speaker 2>seeing an erosion of what we really </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

669
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is a tendency,</v>

670
00:31:19.661 --> 00:31:22.360
<v Speaker 2>this man maintains that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated to read this book,</v>

671
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.950
<v Speaker 2>that we now start looking to politics to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve these problems.</v>

672
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.233
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at politicians or government to </v>

673
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 2>use in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coercion,</v>

674
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.120
<v Speaker 2>to restore things to the right balance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just doesn't work that way.</v>

675
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Really in practicality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm the governor of the state.</v>

676
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Seventh largest state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

677
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.173
<v Speaker 2>it's a very powerful executive position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't just give edicts from up </v>

678
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:54.391
<v Speaker 2>here and expect it to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people have to be engaged and ascent</v>

679
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.610
<v Speaker 2>and do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to self govern,</v>

680
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 2>they have to lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is a very,</v>

681
00:32:00.851 --> 00:32:01.684
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is like the next thing to </v>

682
00:32:04.181 --> 00:32:04.810
<v Speaker 2>think about.</v>

683
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.160
<v Speaker 2>To me it's the next wave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

684
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:11.161
<v Speaker 2>I love what I think it has been fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of my friends and because of the</v>

685
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:13.643
<v Speaker 2>my mind in a way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of always looking for the next </v>

686
00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 2>thing and I can kind of sense the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

687
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:20.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe this is something that </v>

688
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 2>really needs to be talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

689
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's religion,</v>

690
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.573
<v Speaker 2>it's doing well by doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's driving ourselves from the bottom </v>

691
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:33.184
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not trying to vest all this power </v>

692
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:38.380
<v Speaker 2>in a handful of people in the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's futile.</v>

693
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to tell you this,</v>

694
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:42.140
<v Speaker 2>but in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't sound like a politician,</v>

695
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.560
<v Speaker 2>but I think you can take that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>column.</v>

696
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:43.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

697
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

698
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:45.360
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

699
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm a public official.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a CEO of a state.</v>

700
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.113
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drives me crazy because I see that in </v>

701
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:57.630
<v Speaker 2>the middle of trying to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

702
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 2>we're all week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all everybody's week and we're all</v>

703
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:03.230
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to certain pressures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

704
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.790
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

705
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:07.120
<v Speaker 2>we need to run through that door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

706
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.761
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

707
00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:08.151
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

708
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:09.800
<v Speaker 2>no who slowdown here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:11.510
<v Speaker 2>and all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

710
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem with politics,</v>

711
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:15.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could sit next to somebody your </v>

712
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:21.500
<v Speaker 2>entire lifetime in an office job and </v>
<v Speaker 2>never really know what they think.</v>

713
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:22.783
<v Speaker 2>But in politics people get called out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting if they get </v>

714
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:28.874
<v Speaker 2>called out and it's in some ways it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not fair because it's almost like an x </v>

715
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:34.970
<v Speaker 2>ray like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I could know each other,</v>

716
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:35.804
<v Speaker 2>we could hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could watch basketball games and </v>

717
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:38.954
<v Speaker 2>never ever get into my finding out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you make decisions in a really tough </v>

718
00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:44.084
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

719
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 2>But with politics you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to vote and if you vote wrong,</v>

720
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:50.210
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid you're going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

721
00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:52.240
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is,</v>

722
00:33:52.241 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 2>is an amazing process and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrating.</v>

723
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.873
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend and former guests a couple </v>

724
00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:58.430
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric Weinstein,</v>

725
00:33:58.431 --> 00:33:59.264
<v Speaker 2>who's a world renowned mathematician and</v>
<v Speaker 2>also and thinker and authors that he </v>

726
00:34:02.451 --> 00:34:06.080
<v Speaker 2>talks about how one of the things we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost now is communal sensemaking.</v>

727
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.350
<v Speaker 2>That because everything has become so </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicized,</v>

728
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:11.450
<v Speaker 2>sports are politicized now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>

729
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 2>as you just mentioned that all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things have become so political,</v>

730
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 2>but what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that term.</v>

731
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 2>What does that term?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

732
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:19.281
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

733
00:34:19.281 --> 00:34:20.114
<v Speaker 2>everything that happened with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kneeling about the national anthem that </v>

734
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 2>we start that if you turn on sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>center,</v>

735
00:34:24.471 --> 00:34:25.304
<v Speaker 2>you're watching politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you turn on the news and they're </v>

736
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:29.300
<v Speaker 2>talking about Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about sex scan,</v>

737
00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:34.301
<v Speaker 2>but politics or is that a discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue or values?</v>

738
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Is it politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

739
00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess at some level it's both,</v>

740
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:42.260
<v Speaker 2>right on the underlying piece of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a debate about behavior.</v>

741
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.380
<v Speaker 2>It's behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really politics.</v>

742
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:46.243
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand what that person would be </v>

743
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:47.954
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's the right </v>

744
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:50.900
<v Speaker 2>characterization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

745
00:34:50.901 --> 00:34:52.400
<v Speaker 2>you're right on espn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

746
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:53.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

747
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:57.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of angst over there now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of different positions.</v>

748
00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.293
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really kinda debating how we're </v>

749
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 2>supposed to behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

750
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what we're doing now.</v>

751
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.223
<v Speaker 2>What was so amazing about the kneeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was brought about by the guy that </v>

752
00:35:10.431 --> 00:35:12.770
<v Speaker 2>played for the 40 niners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People didn't know this.</v>

753
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I was told this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

754
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:15.580
<v Speaker 2>he's a devout Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

755
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Colin Kaepernick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

756
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.130
<v Speaker 2>when people hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

757
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

758
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:21.014
<v Speaker 2>isn't it interesting that when we dig </v>
<v Speaker 2>into somebody who we feel one way or </v>

759
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:26.684
<v Speaker 2>another about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing sometimes how we find out </v>

760
00:35:28.971 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 2>things that change our fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards them.</v>

761
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.853
<v Speaker 2>Did you find that that whole situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually was what was right about </v>

762
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:37.973
<v Speaker 2>America in a bizarre way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that everybody was screaming </v>

763
00:35:39.661 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I.</v>

764
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 2>here's what nobody was staying in jail </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everywhere.</v>

765
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:43.134
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's what I think where it got </v>

766
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel that the players themselves</v>

767
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:50.094
<v Speaker 2>were able to articulate to Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly why they were doing that and </v>

768
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:55.374
<v Speaker 2>exactly what they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think was kind of lost in the motion </v>

769
00:35:58.651 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to what is real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's behind this?</v>

770
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is really behind this,</v>

771
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a black man and I've worn my kid </v>

772
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.193
<v Speaker 2>that be careful about when you're out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there late at night and what you might </v>

773
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:13.610
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

774
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I think if people heard that and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood that,</v>

775
00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 2>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

776
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.613
<v Speaker 2>so that was the one way you had to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something because it's so divided the </v>

777
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:24.174
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

778
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

779
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

780
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:29.370
<v Speaker 2>and people had different views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

781
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Speaker 2>what I found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

782
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:31.704
<v Speaker 2>what I have found in my life is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull people together like we have on </v>

783
00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:36.330
<v Speaker 2>police and community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough issue.</v>

784
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:41.580
<v Speaker 2>I just had two police officers killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered in my little hometown in Ohio.</v>

785
00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 2>You heard about it happened a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago.</v>

786
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.630
<v Speaker 2>Community needs to understand that mom </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dad need to go home at night.</v>

787
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

788
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.340
<v Speaker 2>they're at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

789
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.120
<v Speaker 2>you go to a domestic disturbance and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go in a door.</v>

790
00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.960
<v Speaker 2>You are putting your life on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Community needs to understand it,</v>

791
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.560
<v Speaker 2>but police need to understand that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

792
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.430
<v Speaker 2>that they need understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

793
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:07.350
<v Speaker 2>If you're not treating people right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the community,</v>

794
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.610
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sit them down the bet,</v>

795
00:37:11.611 --> 00:37:13.050
<v Speaker 2>peel to the better angels.</v>

796
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.560
<v Speaker 2>And in many cases you can come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolutions,</v>

797
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:17.394
<v Speaker 2>but you have to get the right people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a room and you have to appeal to the </v>

798
00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:21.090
<v Speaker 2>better angels of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

799
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:23.790
<v Speaker 2>I suspect you don't think trump is </v>
<v Speaker 2>appealing to better angels.</v>

800
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.400
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

801
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.243
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

802
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

803
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:31.800
<v Speaker 2>my job on this is to my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a position,</v>

804
00:37:31.801 --> 00:37:33.450
<v Speaker 2>a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say things.</v>

805
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.600
<v Speaker 2>knee jerk against trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he does a good thing,</v>

807
00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 2>he shouldn't be praised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he does something that's dividing</v>

808
00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:43.434
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I can't support it to the point </v>

809
00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 2>where I didn't even go to the convention</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my state or ever endorsed him.</v>

810
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't like weaseling around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's the wrong word.</v>

811
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't maneuvering around to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

812
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.140
<v Speaker 2>one day I liked him and the next day I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

813
00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.840
<v Speaker 2>And I just was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was consistent.</v>

814
00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a lot of heat for it.</v>

815
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.413
<v Speaker 2>The amount of pressure that you must </v>
<v Speaker 2>have gotten from the party and from </v>

816
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is pressure pressure?</v>

817
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Whether they say pressures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

818
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.280
<v Speaker 2>a guy that loses his job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a couple kids to feed.</v>

819
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.950
<v Speaker 2>That's pressure pressure in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to do to me?</v>

820
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're going to criticize me,</v>

821
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:16.120
<v Speaker 2>make you know what we talked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

822
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.580
<v Speaker 2>briefly just now about the anthem part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

823
00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:20.220
<v Speaker 2>what are you making the state of race in</v>
<v Speaker 2>America?</v>

824
00:38:20.221 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 2>If you listen to a lot of people right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

825
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:24.520
<v Speaker 2>it seems like we're at the worst racial </v>
<v Speaker 2>state that we've been.</v>

826
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've made a lot of progress.</v>

827
00:38:27.451 --> 00:38:28.284
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think though that what we're seeing </v>

828
00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:30.444
<v Speaker 2>now is it's back to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want somebody getting something </v>

829
00:38:34.141 --> 00:38:38.050
<v Speaker 2>that I don't get and somebody else took </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I have and why doesn't anybody care</v>

830
00:38:38.051 --> 00:38:38.884
<v Speaker 2>about me?</v>

831
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.980
<v Speaker 2>And I think that caring about me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

832
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

833
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that you,</v>

834
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:47.803
<v Speaker 2>that you have a kid and you need and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>need a pill to deal with that kid's </v>

835
00:38:53.021 --> 00:38:56.110
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's expensive and you can't get it.</v>

836
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody stand up for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

837
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 2>if this is where people feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where community matters,</v>

838
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:04.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

839
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>

840
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.140
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm being harassed at work,</v>

841
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 2>how about that story in a New York Times</v>
<v Speaker 2>where these waitresses were being told,</v>

842
00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:15.700
<v Speaker 2>let me grope you and I'll give you a $20</v>
<v Speaker 2>tip.</v>

843
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:16.534
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who in that restaurant saw that and </v>

844
00:39:17.731 --> 00:39:19.420
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take you outside,</v>

845
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the guy that was the perpetrator.</v>

846
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.513
<v Speaker 2>People tend to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think too much of the time that we're </v>

847
00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 2>in this alone that doesn't that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>get back to the overstate this,</v>

848
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:35.080
<v Speaker 2>but back to the texting and the no </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

849
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.360
<v Speaker 2>We got to care about our neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way our neighbor cares about us.</v>

850
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:41.590
<v Speaker 2>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned that from my mother.</v>

851
00:39:41.591 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you interesting story.</v>

852
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.013
<v Speaker 2>My mother and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would hang out at the school all the </v>

853
00:39:46.571 --> 00:39:49.960
<v Speaker 2>time and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids came up and gave his pony rides</v>

854
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 2>and my mother wanted to checkout what </v>
<v Speaker 2>does this whole thing going on up there?</v>

855
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:59.581
<v Speaker 2>So she comes up and I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a dime to do a pony ride.</v>

856
00:40:00.451 --> 00:40:01.284
<v Speaker 2>And and my mother was there and she gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that had the pony a lot more </v>

857
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Speaker 2>money than the cost of the pony ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were walking home and I said,</v>

858
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gave that guy a lot of money.</v>

859
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.641
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny,</v>

860
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 2>did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I was out of place,</v>

861
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:17.723
<v Speaker 2>we got to help people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to see my father given a </v>

862
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:21.154
<v Speaker 2>couple extra bucks to the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked up the trash because he didn't </v>

863
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.273
<v Speaker 2>make much money.</v>

864
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks mom and dad,</v>

865
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 2>because that's something you carry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

866
00:40:32.651 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 2>So this is interesting because I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm talking to half philosopher,</v>

867
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 2>half governor here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's go.</v>

868
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Let's finish with solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

869
00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:42.000
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half philosopher,</v>

870
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.450
<v Speaker 2>half politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governor,</v>

871
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.800
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh governor,</v>

872
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.360
<v Speaker 2>that we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>

873
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 2>But that on your business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

874
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to credit me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk some solutions because</v>

875
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.180
<v Speaker 2>so many things seem wrong in 2016 that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's what led us here.</v>

876
00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>So we can talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific things.</v>

877
00:40:57.761 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 2>So like watching the debates that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were part of,</v>

878
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 2>they're the dumbest way to pick a </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

879
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get from A.</v>

880
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't pick the way to do it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

881
00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about ratings.</v>

882
00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nobody wants to change the format,</v>

883
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.710
<v Speaker 2>but the way it ought to be is what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

884
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Let people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let somebody interview somebody,</v>

885
00:41:14.351 --> 00:41:17.680
<v Speaker 2>find out who they are and then we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>judge instead of like,</v>

886
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:19.660
<v Speaker 2>who's got the cleverest line or who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

887
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:23.170
<v Speaker 2>it's really stupid when you were up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and trump,</v>

888
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually he was brow beating everybody </v>

889
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:26.044
<v Speaker 2>and you could see sort of each debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go by and he'd pick who he had to </v>

890
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:29.770
<v Speaker 2>go for and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

891
00:41:29.771 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 2>the media kind of fell along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That really wasn't for what you're doing</v>

892
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:36.560
<v Speaker 2>here is the field narrowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't show up anymore.</v>

893
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 2>He didn't debate anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wanted them to debate that he,</v>

894
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.193
<v Speaker 2>towards the end when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you stayed to the other guy was </v>

895
00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:45.920
<v Speaker 2>down to fewer and fewer of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 2>But I just think it's a bad way to pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>a president now.</v>

897
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:50.264
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this all started probably with </v>

898
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy and Nixon and Nixon lost because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looked,</v>

899
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have the right brow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sweating.</v>

900
00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a dumb way to pick,</v>

901
00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 2>pick a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

902
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that'll change.</v>

903
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because it makes too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money for the networks.</v>

904
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:09.590
<v Speaker 2>So what are the things we can do to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the electoral system enough?</v>

905
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not somebody that believes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go in and wreck everything,</v>

906
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.060
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me if we could just </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweak something.</v>

907
00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:15.894
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gerrymandering needs to be changed so </v>

908
00:42:16.941 --> 00:42:17.774
<v Speaker 2>that we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerrymandering is where you draw </v>

909
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.220
<v Speaker 2>district to favor one party or the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then all you have to do is listen to</v>

910
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:25.490
<v Speaker 2>people and you're extreme and not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen to people who are,</v>

911
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.670
<v Speaker 2>who are different than you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need to be heard.</v>

912
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't have an answer for the finance,</v>

913
00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 2>the spending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do about it,</v>

914
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 2>but I'm open to anything.</v>

915
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.000
<v Speaker 2>So those are a couple of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really the issue though,</v>

916
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the end of the day is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

917
00:42:39.921 --> 00:42:42.340
<v Speaker 2>if we were just to go backwards with </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

918
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.553
<v Speaker 2>I think gerrymandering is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very serious problem and we are fixing </v>

919
00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:49.550
<v Speaker 2>it in Ohio and I'm proud of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislature for doing it.</v>

920
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't a big part of it.</v>

921
00:42:52.761 --> 00:42:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Also the kind of people we elect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

922
00:42:56.421 --> 00:43:01.310
<v Speaker 2>and do you carry virtue into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>offices and be willing to take a risk.</v>

923
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.940
<v Speaker 2>I've got a friend of mine now who's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>got on the city council and he called me</v>

924
00:43:04.941 --> 00:43:05.721
<v Speaker 2>the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

925
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I just seem to be making everybody mad </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they all want to have this,</v>

926
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.270
<v Speaker 2>this thing that they want to do and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just think it's dumb.</v>

927
00:43:11.271 --> 00:43:11.841
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

928
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 2>just just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:15.140
<v Speaker 2>pick your battles and be pleasant than </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

930
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.723
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't want to be in these jobs </v>

931
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's natural.</v>

932
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to go to work and lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>their job.</v>

933
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to do that,</v>

934
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 2>but you're not in these jobs for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

935
00:43:26.931 --> 00:43:27.764
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should be at the end </v>

936
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:31.813
<v Speaker 2>of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that really what the government's </v>

937
00:43:32.511 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 2>role is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just making sure we have jobs.</v>

938
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:43:35.451 --> 00:43:36.284
<v Speaker 2>making sure we're basically secure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the greatest moral purpose </v>

940
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.613
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to provide an environment for job </v>

941
00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:44.030
<v Speaker 2>creation because that's what creates </v>
<v Speaker 2>human dignity,</v>

942
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:45.223
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what strengthens communities and </v>

943
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.780
<v Speaker 2>builds a strengthened families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

944
00:43:49.781 --> 00:43:50.614
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the government of the United States </v>

945
00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.710
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are protected,</v>

946
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:55.783
<v Speaker 2>that we can be free and yet safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's also course domestic </v>

947
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:00.590
<v Speaker 2>tranquility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

948
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:03.950
<v Speaker 2>that we're at peace where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have high unemployment,</v>

949
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.940
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

950
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.773
<v Speaker 2>So I believe our greatest moral purpose </v>
<v Speaker 2>as politician for me and my job is the </v>

951
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:12.860
<v Speaker 2>fact that I need to have a job creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

952
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting as I'm listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

953
00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:15.344
<v Speaker 2>I can understand the reasons for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>liking trump and the tweets and virtue </v>

954
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:23.630
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get that in terms of policy of the</v>

955
00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:25.010
<v Speaker 2>things that he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

956
00:44:25.011 --> 00:44:27.410
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about immigration.</v>

957
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea that we're going to ship</v>
<v Speaker 2>these Daca kids out to me as well,</v>

958
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:31.543
<v Speaker 2>but we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know where the Democrats </v>

959
00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:33.540
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We keep talking about trump.</v>

960
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:34.374
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're in the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Bart is Bernie and his left wing </v>

961
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:38.860
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that where,</v>

962
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where the Democrats are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this Daca thing should be solved.</v>

963
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are people,</v>

964
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:44.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25,</v>

965
00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 2>26,</v>
<v Speaker 2>27 years old.</v>

966
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.510
<v Speaker 2>It came here when they were six or seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>or eight.</v>

967
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:49.344
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to ship them out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a meaningful part of our </v>

968
00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:51.610
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

969
00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:55.140
<v Speaker 2>So what do you actually do then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they oughta be grandfathered in.</v>

970
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:55.974
<v Speaker 2>They ought to be said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to stay and then when it comes </v>

971
00:44:58.261 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 2>to immigration itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to know who's coming and we need</v>

972
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:05.070
<v Speaker 2>to be able to protect our borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to be shrinking legal,</v>

973
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:05.904
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people create a great deal to </v>

974
00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 2>our country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trade,</v>

975
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a thorny issue,</v>

976
00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:12.564
<v Speaker 2>but 40 million Americans have trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>related jobs and most of the businesses </v>

977
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:21.630
<v Speaker 2>that are involved in exporting or small </v>
<v Speaker 2>and medium size businesses and consumers</v>

978
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:22.464
<v Speaker 2>benefit from open and free enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not open and free find and have a </v>

979
00:45:24.961 --> 00:45:29.190
<v Speaker 2>process to restore equity but just don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out to create a trade war.</v>

980
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

981
00:45:30.751 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean those are things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else you want to ask about?</v>

982
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean those are two that jump out at </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

983
00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of them.</v>

984
00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:36.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll throw a couple others that we </v>

985
00:45:38.121 --> 00:45:38.954
<v Speaker 1>actually did meet once before it was at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was the first or second </v>

986
00:45:41.571 --> 00:45:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Republican debate and I asked you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>question and you know,</v>

987
00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.133
<v Speaker 1>with everyone's jamming the nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong enough where we're jamming their </v>

988
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.910
<v Speaker 1>megaphones in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

989
00:45:49.911 --> 00:45:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I had to fight through plenty of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the question.</v>

990
00:45:51.951 --> 00:45:52.784
<v Speaker 1>But basically at my question to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the social issues that gay </v>

991
00:45:56.331 --> 00:45:57.400
<v Speaker 1>marriage in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

992
00:45:57.401 --> 00:45:58.234
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at the first debate you </v>

993
00:45:59.571 --> 00:46:00.404
<v Speaker 1>immediately said they asked you about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you said that's not what I want to </v>

994
00:46:02.601 --> 00:46:03.970
<v Speaker 1>focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

995
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

996
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I remember exactly what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it did get a uh,</v>

997
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

998
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

999
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1000
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not where I want to live because </v>

1001
00:46:12.721 --> 00:46:14.420
<v Speaker 2>that is a dividing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1002
00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.050
<v Speaker 2>in terms of gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine with it.</v>

1003
00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:16.884
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was that time when I said I </v>

1004
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:20.940
<v Speaker 2>was going to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wedding of my,</v>

1005
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 2>of my gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:24.330
<v Speaker 2>one of my gay friends who's terrific and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to them all that.</v>

1007
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.193
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think that way that's </v>

1008
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:27.660
<v Speaker 2>behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's beyond us.</v>

1009
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.240
<v Speaker 1>So you'd love for the Republicans to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>past the social stuff,</v>

1010
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:30.571
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1011
00:46:30.571 --> 00:46:31.404
<v Speaker 1>I think in effect the party has even </v>
<v Speaker 1>even the more conservative Christian </v>

1012
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 1>side of the party is in talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1013
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:36.714
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got on here Santorum or how could </v>

1014
00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.110
<v Speaker 1>he really rally taller?</v>

1015
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1016
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.400
<v Speaker 2>things have changed and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1017
00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I prefer the traditional marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1018
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like I don't worry what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and they're not.</v>

1019
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.230
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned to me it's your 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>anniversary with your wife today.</v>

1020
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm here and here you are with me.</v>

1021
00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.640
<v Speaker 1>What does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that says.</v>

1022
00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you on a medical marijuana or </v>

1023
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:04.283
<v Speaker 1>illegally?</v>

1024
00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not for legalizing it because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets.</v>

1025
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told people when I was in college,</v>

1026
00:47:09.041 --> 00:47:10.710
<v Speaker 2>of course I smoke dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

1027
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.000
<v Speaker 2>we all did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all did.</v>

1028
00:47:13.001 --> 00:47:14.430
<v Speaker 2>But many of us did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1029
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:17.650
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell kids don't do drugs,</v>

1030
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.120
<v Speaker 2>but by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this drugs.</v>

1031
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a problem.</v>

1032
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:22.263
<v Speaker 2>Medical Marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have it in our state and we have it </v>

1033
00:47:25.601 --> 00:47:26.434
<v Speaker 2>in our state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think legalizing it is a </v>

1034
00:47:28.181 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 2>good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1035
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Is this one of those things where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I hear that to me,</v>

1036
00:47:32.621 --> 00:47:35.530
<v Speaker 2>this is where my libertarian side </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking him and I would say,</v>

1037
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 2>well you can put anything in your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want.</v>

1038
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:41.310
<v Speaker 2>And as long as you're doing it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>privacy of your own home and the rest of</v>

1039
00:47:41.311 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 2>that's a bad argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes a lot of sense to me.</v>

1040
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 2>But you think that if we just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfurl this,</v>

1041
00:47:46.031 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 2>that just say I got kids here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've got an opiate crisis.</v>

1042
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I just was looking last night you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>fentinol and these street drugs,</v>

1044
00:47:52.871 --> 00:47:53.704
<v Speaker 2>whether it's coke or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or heroin and just dropping dead left </v>

1045
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:57.910
<v Speaker 2>and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1046
00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:02.620
<v Speaker 2>this is not a time when I think we ought</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be trying to say to kids,</v>

1047
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:03.311
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1048
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Don't do any drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1049
00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 2>but this one's okay to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of how I feel about it.</v>

1050
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.970
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.390
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1052
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.363
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we look and we have a lot of people </v>

1053
00:48:14.051 --> 00:48:14.884
<v Speaker 2>die from drunk driving and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we'd been through that and I don't </v>

1054
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 2>know where this is all going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately end up.</v>

1055
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:23.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm just giving you my sense dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a real problem here.</v>

1056
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to explain to young</v>
<v Speaker 2>people the two that you can do this,</v>

1057
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:30.520
<v Speaker 2>but don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be a simple message for me.</v>

1058
00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1059
00:48:31.181 --> 00:48:33.340
<v Speaker 2>A couple more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the big question at the end.</v>

1060
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:34.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1061
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:35.840
<v Speaker 2>I can answer the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan.</v>

1062
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm going to do in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

1063
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know.</v>

1064
00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:41.104
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to participate in a </v>

1065
00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:44.764
<v Speaker 2>positive way in the public debate that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my voice to be out there and </v>

1066
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda what I wanna do and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know where that's gonna take me.</v>

1067
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:51.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm not plotting and scheming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm making a lot of effort to be </v>

1068
00:48:55.121 --> 00:48:57.790
<v Speaker 2>able to have the resources to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay.</v>

1069
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 2>All options are really on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what,</v>

1070
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:04.180
<v Speaker 2>what will be exercise because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what the future's going to bring.</v>

1071
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.103
<v Speaker 2>The big question is going to be whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want it to play golf with me after </v>

1072
00:49:06.641 --> 00:49:08.620
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are you a good golfer?</v>

1073
00:49:08.621 --> 00:49:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Not well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I not.</v>

1074
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:11.741
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1075
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:12.310
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1076
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:13.810
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the answer to that question.</v>

1077
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.060
<v Speaker 2>A couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're in California right now.</v>

1078
00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:16.894
<v Speaker 2>I know you just met with Arnold </v>
<v Speaker 2>Schwarzenegger and you guys are talking </v>

1079
00:49:19.181 --> 00:49:22.990
<v Speaker 2>about how to reset Californian in </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

1080
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an insanely high tax state.</v>

1081
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.950
<v Speaker 2>If I told you what my property taxes on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this place,</v>

1082
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:29.803
<v Speaker 2>your head would explode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should probably move to Ohio if you </v>

1083
00:49:31.511 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>want to help her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my property taxes are high enough.</v>

1084
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 2>It makes my head explode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Driving in my state.</v>

1085
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Trust me in La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1087
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.860
<v Speaker 2>what do you think can be done to help a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place like California?</v>

1088
00:49:41.861 --> 00:49:44.650
<v Speaker 2>That's obviously so less traditional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening though,</v>

1089
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:46.390
<v Speaker 2>is you're beginning to lose people.</v>

1090
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1091
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.710
<v Speaker 2>whether it's to Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no income tax or to Nevada,</v>

1092
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:52.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to Austin,</v>

1093
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:53.141
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1094
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to see that happening.</v>

1095
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.103
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to make government more </v>

1096
00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.594
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you remember in the old days when </v>

1097
00:50:00.161 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 2>you bought a kindle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1098
00:50:01.301 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 2>you had to pay money for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they'll pay you to have a kid.</v>

1099
00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:04.943
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we need to use creative and 21st </v>

1100
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:13.240
<v Speaker 2>century technology and techniques to </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny that government down to get it to</v>

1101
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:15.880
<v Speaker 2>do what it's supposed to do and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient and effective.</v>

1102
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.863
<v Speaker 2>You just said you can't believe what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like for me to get permission to </v>

1103
00:50:19.781 --> 00:50:21.500
<v Speaker 2>build a studio in my garage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1104
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.800
<v Speaker 2>that's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the 21st century.</v>

1105
00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:25.250
<v Speaker 2>What are they worried about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1106
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love California.</v>

1108
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding me?</v>

1109
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted a campaign out here,</v>

1110
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 2>but things move too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1111
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.823
<v Speaker 2>how could you not love this state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can also do enough things to </v>

1112
00:50:40.311 --> 00:50:44.480
<v Speaker 2>begin to drive people in businesses out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that it's not good.</v>

1113
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:45.613
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well since you answered the big one </v>

1114
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.201
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1115
00:50:47.201 --> 00:50:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll just give you a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wide one to bring us home with,</v>

1116
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.253
<v Speaker 2>which would be so many emails that I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweets and messages that I get are all </v>

1117
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:56.250
<v Speaker 2>about people that are just afraid to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>

1118
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.133
<v Speaker 2>Can I go back for one second?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you were asking about these </v>

1119
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 2>social issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1120
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I read an article about Billy Graham who</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1121
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:06.943
<v Speaker 2>who spoke to 200 million people across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the globe and he had fights with people </v>

1122
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:16.160
<v Speaker 2>inside of faith because he stayed away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the hot button social issues of the</v>

1123
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:18.710
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is possible.</v>

1124
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dealing with guns right now.</v>

1125
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have brought a group of people </v>

1126
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:24.464
<v Speaker 2>together to mediate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can deal with these social </v>

1127
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1128
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.790
<v Speaker 2>by being in a position of bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people together at the end.</v>

1129
00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:33.560
<v Speaker 2>You may have to walk away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table,</v>

1130
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.930
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I admire with Billy Graham said,</v>

1131
00:51:35.931 --> 00:51:38.150
<v Speaker 2>there's so much negativity in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1132
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I like Billy Graham did well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1133
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I just focus on the positive things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uplifting things.</v>

1134
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:45.583
<v Speaker 2>Instead of dragging yourself down into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ditches where we just go into </v>

1135
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 2>warfare with world war one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>war for trench warfare,</v>

1136
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to help us in the long </v>
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>

1137
00:51:56.931 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Those issues can be dealt with in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1138
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.521
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1139
00:52:00.521 --> 00:52:02.840
<v Speaker 2>and on the edges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the end,</v>

1140
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:07.870
<v Speaker 2>let's try to lift our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Casick 20 slash 20 politician.</v>

1141
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:08.990
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

1142
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Philosopher slash gov.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

1143
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I see it all coming together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1144
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:13.004
<v Speaker 2>so the final one though is that I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these messages and tweets and </v>

1145
00:52:16.071 --> 00:52:19.100
<v Speaker 2>emails from people that are afraid to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get involved.</v>

1146
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.963
<v Speaker 2>They're just afraid to say what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think either because of political </v>

1147
00:52:22.461 --> 00:52:23.294
<v Speaker 2>correctness or the way it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>affect their job or their friends or </v>

1148
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:27.350
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're obviously out there.</v>

1149
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:28.184
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're clearly not afraid to say what </v>

1150
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:30.171
<v Speaker 2>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

1151
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:31.004
<v Speaker 2>there was no preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sat down and we did this for an </v>

1152
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.400
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say to those young people</v>

1153
00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:35.660
<v Speaker 2>that want to look?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1154
00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:42.340
<v Speaker 2>life is short and life is also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journey.</v>

1155
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:50.090
<v Speaker 2>You got to listen to your conscience and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's hard.</v>

1156
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when you stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you might lose something,</v>

1157
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.273
<v Speaker 2>but in the long run you'll be admired </v>
<v Speaker 2>and leave an indelible impression for </v>

1158
00:53:00.111 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 2>showing courage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have people around you that you can talk</v>

1159
00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:08.360
<v Speaker 2>these things through because you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing it all yourself leads to self</v>

1160
00:53:08.361 --> 00:53:11.570
<v Speaker 2>righteous behavior that is not always </v>
<v Speaker 2>very pretty,</v>

1161
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:15.320
<v Speaker 2>but at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look yourself in the mirror.</v>

1162
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:17.383
<v Speaker 2>Look yourself in the mirror and I happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to believe that there's a world yet to </v>

1163
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:24.860
<v Speaker 2>come that's really know how am I going </v>
<v Speaker 2>into that one,</v>

1164
00:53:24.861 --> 00:53:25.694
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a world yet to come and I </v>

1165
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:32.301
<v Speaker 2>think our actions here prepare us for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that world and it's going to be okay.</v>

1166
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:38.060
<v Speaker 2>That's how you ended up in interview for</v>
<v Speaker 2>more on Governor Casick checkout,</v>
