<v Speaker 2>the people who happened to comment on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the video or tweet to me wherever you </v>

25
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a living,</v>

26
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 2>breathing example of why ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 2>secular values and free speech matter.</v>

27
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.713
<v Speaker 2>For my interviews to you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>furthering the conversations on social </v>

28
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:08.391
<v Speaker 2>media were igniting ideas and people all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world who share the same ideals</v>

29
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 2>as the civil rights activist.</v>

30
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Medgar Evers said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kill a man,</v>

31
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.583
<v Speaker 2>but you can't kill an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whether you're listening to this in </v>

32
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 2>the comforts of your vacation home on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Italian coast,</v>

33
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 2>while on a bus in India or in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment complex in war torn Iraq,</v>

34
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.473
<v Speaker 2>you're a piece of the puzzle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reclaiming liberalism and having honest </v>

35
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 2>conversations even with those whom we </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree,</v>

36
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.693
<v Speaker 2>ideas of brought us together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we're just at the precipice </v>

37
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 2>of what this conversation about free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and liberalism could become.</v>

38
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 2>So now I want you guys to be part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show more than ever before.</v>

39
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 2>I think we can do something bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 2>just emailing,</v>

40
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 2>tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and facebooking.</v>

41
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.624
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk directly to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consider this my official request to </v>

42
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 2>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

43
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.173
<v Speaker 2>you on the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take a group of five </v>

44
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:58.254
<v Speaker 2>viewers from five different countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I will interview you via skype for </v>

45
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:02.034
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes.</v>

46
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Posting them all as one complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode.</v>

47
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do,</v>

48
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 2>why you think the conversations we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been having here are important,</v>

49
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 2>and how you came to think the way you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

50
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I think we can amplify our message of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

51
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>human rights and secular values in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>exponential way.</v>

52
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're a religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist,</v>

53
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>

54
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:24.451
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white,</v>

55
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 2>gay or straight.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you got it.</v>

72
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:18.544
<v Speaker 2>secular humanist movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a platform committed to the use of </v>

73
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.264
<v Speaker 2>critical reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>factual evidence and scientific methods </v>

74
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.194
<v Speaker 2>of inquiry rather than faith and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysticism in seeking solutions to human </v>

75
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 2>problems and answers to important human </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

76
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.653
<v Speaker 2>That was a serious intro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys write a nice boiler plate </v>

77
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you.</v>

78
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried my best.</v>

79
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>You gave me all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are all the buzzwords that we talk</v>

80
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 2>about all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

81
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

82
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

83
00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word committed is the most important</v>

84
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Committed,</v>

85
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 2>committed to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These principles,</v>

86
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>because it's very hard to be consistent </v>
<v Speaker 2>these days.</v>

87
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.350
<v Speaker 2>It is hard to because especially as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

88
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the folks,</v>

89
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.070
<v Speaker 2>we conserve our allies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

90
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.060
<v Speaker 2>they have their mind on Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

91
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 2>and other stuff.</v>

92
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 2>They changed their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the word committed here is I think is</v>

93
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:06.930
<v Speaker 2>the most important one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

94
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 2>So you're itching to get right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get into.</v>

103
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>I want to do a little bit just on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>histories first.</v>

104
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 2>So since we've had feisal here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's start with you Melissa.</v>

105
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 2>So you are originally from Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved here,</v>

106
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.750
<v Speaker 3>but I moved here in 2004 for college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

107
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.830
<v Speaker 3>worked and then went to Grad school and </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue working.</v>

108
00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:41.900
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

109
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got sold the American dream and the </v>

110
00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:46.790
<v Speaker 3>American ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

111
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in part it's the same thing that drew </v>

112
00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 3>both of us here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

113
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

114
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.700
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't have more different </v>
<v Speaker 3>backgrounds.</v>

115
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Phase all grew up under a dictatorship </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Baghdad and he has only known war and</v>

116
00:04:59.061 --> 00:04:59.894
<v Speaker 3>strife his whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've had an interesting parallel </v>

117
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.830
<v Speaker 3>childhood it Singapore where it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>benevolent dictatorship,</v>

118
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

119
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 3>he grew up under those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was safe and,</v>

120
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very prosperous,</v>

121
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:17.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>city and life there is stable.</v>

122
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that people,</v>

123
00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:22.160
<v Speaker 2>at least in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to expand some,</v>

124
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.000
<v Speaker 2>some worldly knowledge on people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like people don't really know</v>

125
00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:26.834
<v Speaker 2>anything about Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say a benevolent </v>

126
00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 2>dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

127
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.323
<v Speaker 2>what does that even mean?</v>

128
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been a single party state since </v>

129
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.334
<v Speaker 3>1965.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One government has one party has ruled </v>

130
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:40.164
<v Speaker 3>the country since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since that time ever since it's gained </v>

131
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 3>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

132
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they are,</v>

133
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic freedoms are,</v>

134
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.993
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are extremely well developed in </v>

135
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:51.444
<v Speaker 3>Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Heritage Foundation listed as </v>

136
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:56.100
<v Speaker 3>two out of 180 on the economic freedom </v>
<v Speaker 3>index.</v>

137
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at political freedom,</v>

138
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of expression,</v>

139
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 3>freedom of the press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's virtually nonexistent.</v>

140
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 3>So basically there's freedom to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursue the work that you want,</v>

141
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 3>but not necessarily say the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want.</v>

142
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.963
<v Speaker 3>It is a neo liberal contradiction in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that regard because it's extremely </v>

143
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 3>fiscally austere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low taxes,</v>

144
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 3>free trade deregulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all the buzzwords that,</v>

145
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right wing economists,</v>

146
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love right by it.</v>

147
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

148
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

149
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:31.154
<v Speaker 3>I think it's sort of throwing a wrench </v>
<v Speaker 3>into Milton Friedman's capitalism and </v>

150
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His theory about,</v>

151
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.633
<v Speaker 3>he said that economic freedom is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary precondition to political </v>

152
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 3>freedom and civil freedoms and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not really happening.</v>

153
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 3>So that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Singapore sorta got half of it,</v>

154
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the economic part,</v>

155
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 3>but not the social part in the political</v>
<v Speaker 3>part right now.</v>

156
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Of course you come</v>

157
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.870
<v Speaker 4>from both of them are in my country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got everything.</v>

158
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.143
<v Speaker 4>So she's got one for two and you got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit has to do with some of the </v>

159
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:05.704
<v Speaker 4>things that we did here in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for the people that don't know your </v>

160
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:07.954
<v Speaker 4>story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give me like a two minute recap of </v>

161
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 4>growing up in Iraq and catches up on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

162
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.443
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was born in Iraq and I was born in </v>

163
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Babylon and raised in Baghdad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

164
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.350
<v Speaker 4>my first year was under Saddam Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dictatorship,</v>

165
00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:24.430
<v Speaker 4>and then afterwards the US invasion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Iraq happened and uh,</v>

166
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.330
<v Speaker 4>continuing with civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

167
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.173
<v Speaker 4>my spark for activism was kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed of because after the intervention </v>

168
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.463
<v Speaker 4>we had the first rocket elections and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>saw the rise of secretary and politics </v>

169
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:38.344
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since I was a young boy back then I was </v>

170
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.344
<v Speaker 4>advocating for secular values and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to prevent the rise of terrorist </v>

171
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:49.054
<v Speaker 4>groups like what we have right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was afraid that if I want to </v>

172
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 4>grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes over the other and that's good.</v>

173
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.420
<v Speaker 4>Not obviously go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

174
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.490
<v Speaker 4>I left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So within,</v>

175
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 4>like the Sol was rising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost members of my lost.</v>

176
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 4>My brother lost my cousin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was also a lot,</v>

177
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.160
<v Speaker 4>so friends and the had to leave Iraq in </v>
<v Speaker 4>2009.</v>

178
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and actually a year afterwards I started</v>

179
00:08:13.061 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 4>like the pages total global secular </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanist movement that eventually became</v>

180
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:19.770
<v Speaker 4>one of the largest in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I left Iraq,</v>

181
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.780
<v Speaker 4>I went into country close to Singapore </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Malaysia and I applied for asylum,</v>

182
00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:25.894
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the NHCR United Nations </v>

183
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Committee for Refugees and I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted to come to America.</v>

184
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that 13.</v>

185
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:31.923
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I wanted to have you both </v>
<v Speaker 4>on together because I think it's really </v>

186
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:35.524
<v Speaker 4>interesting people that come from </v>
<v Speaker 4>different places and as you say on the </v>

187
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:40.420
<v Speaker 4>show all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is we talk about here transcend</v>

188
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:41.160
<v Speaker 4>borders,</v>

189
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.090
<v Speaker 3>they transcend ethnicity and nationality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of those things.</v>

190
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.400
<v Speaker 3>So when you were there and when you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up,</v>

191
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:51.300
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you have a political awakening while</v>

192
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:52.134
<v Speaker 3>you were there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you realize that you couldn't say </v>

193
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 3>some of the things that you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say in kind of stuff?</v>

194
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

195
00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:58.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Singapore,</v>

196
00:08:58.181 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 3>it late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

197
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 3>when you first entered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when somebody learns that I am from this</v>

198
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will say one or two things.</v>

199
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.730
<v Speaker 3>The first one is I heard chewing gum is </v>
<v Speaker 3>banned.</v>

200
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.280
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

201
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I heard you can't bring bubble gum into </v>
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

202
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is true.</v>

203
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Every chewing gum it used to be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've relaxed it a little so,</v>

204
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:16.960
<v Speaker 3>so you can't purchase it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

205
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 3>you can't purchase chewing gum there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It and it's for very,</v>

206
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of silly reasons.</v>

207
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.750
<v Speaker 3>Possibly back in the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

208
00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Singapore was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was developing economically,</v>

209
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:26.240
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

210
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 3>but you can develop really fast </v>
<v Speaker 3>economically,</v>

211
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:28.944
<v Speaker 3>but the people's mindsets and civility </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tragedy of the common sort of </v>

212
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 3>mindset hasn't had not developed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they went litter,</v>

213
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stick your chewing gum on the doors </v>

214
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:40.880
<v Speaker 3>of the trains and then it gets stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the government was like,</v>

215
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to spend tax dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>cleaning this up so you can't handle the</v>

216
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 3>chewing gum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to take it away.</v>

217
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that talk about it and authority.</v>

218
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.673
<v Speaker 2>Autocratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

219
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Really at a very micro level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how authoritarian the government.</v>

220
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

221
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Speaker 3>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second one is,</v>

222
00:09:56.521 --> 00:09:57.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if one of the,</v>

223
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.303
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of the best gifts you can get </v>

224
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:03.830
<v Speaker 3>in Singapore for like tourists to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>home that,</v>

225
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.673
<v Speaker 3>that people usually get is a t shirt </v>
<v Speaker 3>that says Singapore is a fine city and </v>

226
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 3>on it they're all the different fines </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can get,</v>

227
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 3>like you can not eat on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the public,</v>

228
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.980
<v Speaker 3>the public train systems and it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>country with very strong rule of law and</v>

229
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.843
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of rules that you can't do </v>

230
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:23.844
<v Speaker 3>this and you can't do that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything under the guise of </v>

231
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 3>maintaining social harmony.</v>

232
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.843
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume it's some level that probably </v>

233
00:10:31.211 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 2>works right at some level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The social,</v>

234
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

235
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.020
<v Speaker 3>We have not had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

236
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.990
<v Speaker 3>radicalization of our Sunni Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

237
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.223
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as much as any other country </v>

238
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.850
<v Speaker 3>actually I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's been largely,</v>

239
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've had,</v>

240
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.910
<v Speaker 3>you have Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hindus,</v>

241
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Buddhists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims,</v>

242
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.890
<v Speaker 3>living very harmoniously together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've not had any incidents.</v>

243
00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:54.970
<v Speaker 3>So there is something to be said about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the methods of top down,</v>

244
00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:55.804
<v Speaker 3>institutionalization of social harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that manifests itself in </v>

245
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.080
<v Speaker 3>sedition laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blasphemy laws,</v>

246
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.453
<v Speaker 3>and as recently as last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was used to throw a 17 year old </v>

247
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 3>blogger into jail for wounding the the </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings of religious people.</v>

248
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:19.170
<v Speaker 3>All he did was a say some stuff about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ and twink,</v>

249
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.313
<v Speaker 3>at least 20 grown up adults in Singapore</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt offended enough to file a police </v>

250
00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:28.540
<v Speaker 3>report and they threw a 17 year old and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Dale.</v>

251
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.523
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've talked a little bit about what </v>

252
00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:31.894
<v Speaker 2>they've done to bloggers in Bangladesh </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Singapore and you've connected me </v>

253
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.660
<v Speaker 2>with the Bangladeshi blogger who I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have on soon.</v>

254
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.980
<v Speaker 2>These are the people that we need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>caring about more,</v>

255
00:11:41.981 --> 00:11:42.814
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because these are the people that you </v>

256
00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:47.380
<v Speaker 2>guys could have been had you not left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

257
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.273
<v Speaker 2>I mean they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everyone knows like whatever one </v>

258
00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:51.754
<v Speaker 2>of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these folks get killed or like </v>

259
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>what happened in Bangladesh</v>

260
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.903
<v Speaker 4>or do I be a good job?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that these guys are the </v>

261
00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:58.204
<v Speaker 4>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know that they stand for the same </v>

262
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 4>values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we stand for,</v>

263
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 4>and we know the data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best counter they created.</v>

264
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 4>The best counter narrative to extremist </v>
<v Speaker 4>I the,</v>

265
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.160
<v Speaker 4>like the Sam Harris of Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

266
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.213
<v Speaker 4>He's an intellectual who has advocated </v>
<v Speaker 4>for great values that in a country that </v>

267
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:17.104
<v Speaker 4>is as extreme as Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't have changed the world in </v>

268
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.303
<v Speaker 4>Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the main exporter of </v>

269
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Wahhabi ideology that killed the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bungalow bloggers that,</v>

270
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.763
<v Speaker 4>that created the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which a country that has nuclear </v>

271
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:30.150
<v Speaker 4>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

272
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.150
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we have to,</v>

273
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.033
<v Speaker 4>they are our best resource that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>should always continue to help them as </v>

274
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 4>much as we can and whenever we can.</v>

275
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:39.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you were there and you saw this </v>

276
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 2>sort of authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did you realize,</v>

277
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm gonna Express what's in me,</v>

278
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:48.220
<v Speaker 2>I may have to leave.</v>

279
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.720
<v Speaker 3>I started realized that in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

280
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

281
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.090
<v Speaker 3>in Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

282
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.100
<v Speaker 3>many of the best schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at the top,</v>

283
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in academia,</v>

284
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were religious schools,</v>

285
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.173
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like a sort of a stage of the </v>

286
00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:04.110
<v Speaker 3>colonial era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the British came,</v>

287
00:13:04.111 --> 00:13:04.944
<v Speaker 3>it was a British colony and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had all the missionaries from </v>

288
00:13:07.141 --> 00:13:07.860
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

289
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.671
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Europe.</v>

290
00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:11.640
<v Speaker 3>They came to set up schools to educate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the locals.</v>

291
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 3>And so this became associated with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>economics like high academic standards.</v>

292
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.170
<v Speaker 3>So I ended up going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

293
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.213
<v Speaker 3>a methodist schools which were </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with a very high academic </v>

294
00:13:24.211 --> 00:13:24.840
<v Speaker 3>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

295
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Did you grow up methodist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

296
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.810
<v Speaker 3>And I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I did.</v>

297
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.760
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the religious,</v>

298
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.403
<v Speaker 3>the religious schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are quite a force to reckon with </v>

299
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:39.050
<v Speaker 3>in Singapore and in producing graduates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess I realized that,</v>

300
00:13:42.091 --> 00:13:42.924
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a country that is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>self enforcing in terms of political </v>

301
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:48.444
<v Speaker 3>correctness.</v>

302
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.240
<v Speaker 3>If you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

303
00:13:51.241 --> 00:13:54.690
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of rules and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason people don't,</v>

304
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.660
<v Speaker 3>don't do something or don't litter is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's,</v>

305
00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.130
<v Speaker 3>there's a fine waiting to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

306
00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:02.964
<v Speaker 3>so the motivation to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something or to not do something </v>

307
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.740
<v Speaker 3>is completely extrinsic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're all self policing each other.</v>

308
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of,</v>

309
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought into the,</v>

310
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.833
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

311
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.260
<v Speaker 3>sort of ideal of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first amendment,</v>

312
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.363
<v Speaker 3>the freedom of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech because I was always </v>

313
00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Speaker 3>that rebellious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

314
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.160
<v Speaker 3>skeptic in my circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my religious circle and,</v>

315
00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:29.994
<v Speaker 3>and school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty much overlapped at that </v>

316
00:14:31.951 --> 00:14:33.420
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

317
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.360
<v Speaker 3>and that's when I realized I need to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

318
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.510
<v Speaker 3>You really need to get out if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I need it to,</v>

319
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.770
<v Speaker 3>if I want it to broaden my mind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fulfill that.</v>

320
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious when you hear the phrase </v>

321
00:14:43.141 --> 00:14:47.250
<v Speaker 2>self policing in a place like Singapore </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their self policing because of fines</v>

322
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.980
<v Speaker 2>and sort of this authoritarian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I've been saying on</v>

323
00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>the short time is that we now self </v>
<v Speaker 2>policing</v>

324
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 4>ourselves in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not coming.</v>

325
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we always used to fear the idea that the</v>

326
00:14:57.381 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 4>government is what's going to come in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and take away our Frisco.</v>

327
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 4>But now it's we're doing it to ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's happening in academia,</v>

328
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 4>which I want to talk to you guys a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>

329
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.253
<v Speaker 4>but when you hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that make you crazy knowings from </v>

330
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 4>where you came?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

331
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.880
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen 84,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but four people,</v>

332
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's backwards.</v>

333
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.260
<v Speaker 4>It's something like 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

334
00:15:16.261 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be honest,</v>

335
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

336
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 4>before I came to United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had like a very good image of what,</v>

337
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:25.820
<v Speaker 4>like when I came to America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people,</v>

338
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.713
<v Speaker 4>especially the people who believe in St </v>
<v Speaker 4>Louis with as I am the secular liberals </v>

339
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:29.984
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the West with just give and I will </v>

340
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 4>say at first because the movement has </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

341
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Write something on the left has changed </v>
<v Speaker 4>over the last couple of years.</v>

342
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.403
<v Speaker 4>So when you moved here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm guessing maybe it was a little more </v>

343
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 4>welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>

344
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.733
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was welcoming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I thought it would be more </v>

345
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.344
<v Speaker 4>welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that there was this huge </v>

346
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 4>splits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that if I can,</v>

347
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.170
<v Speaker 4>if anybody can be advocating for same </v>
<v Speaker 4>sex marriage in a,</v>

348
00:15:53.171 --> 00:15:55.340
<v Speaker 4>in a western country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's totally okay.</v>

349
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.710
<v Speaker 4>But the moment you talk about it in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslim country,</v>

350
00:15:57.711 --> 00:15:59.140
<v Speaker 4>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

351
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

352
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.400
<v Speaker 4>And I didn't know about these dynamics </v>
<v Speaker 4>that when you talk about the same values</v>

353
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:05.234
<v Speaker 4>that the American liberals that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>cared for when you move it to a </v>

354
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:07.814
<v Speaker 4>universal or another country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would immediately be called a </v>

355
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 4>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when I got into that,</v>

356
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.970
<v Speaker 4>I started getting attacked left or </v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

357
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 4>or like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

358
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying is that I support same </v>
<v Speaker 4>sex marriage.</v>

359
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Speaker 4>And they like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well that is a form of colonialism.</v>

360
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.243
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no fucking getting made because you're </v>

361
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 4>saying the same thing for like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>

362
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 4>And I just said that I believe that gays</v>
<v Speaker 4>are humans.</v>

363
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:35.100
<v Speaker 4>Even in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

364
00:16:35.101 --> 00:16:35.934
<v Speaker 4>I think they are humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They breathe and they have the same DNA </v>

365
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 4>for human beings are really out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

366
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.193
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like I don't really think of myself </v>

367
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:48.230
<v Speaker 4>as a radical person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think that I'm advocating as.</v>

368
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 4>But the moment you just shifted to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different culture,</v>

369
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because what I found very difficult here</v>

370
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:58.270
<v Speaker 4>is that because we are minorities coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

371
00:16:58.271 --> 00:16:59.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the majority dominate here,</v>

372
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 4>so I'm a minority all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when it comes to color of my skin,</v>

373
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here in America,</v>

374
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 4>there is this concept of the authentic </v>
<v Speaker 4>voice when it comes to minorities,</v>

375
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.520
<v Speaker 4>is that there are these stereotypes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's from the right on the left,</v>

376
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.780
<v Speaker 4>like if you are from this specific race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

377
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 4>the issues that you should care about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most in this specific order.</v>

378
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.220
<v Speaker 4>If you are a Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should care about immigration and,</v>

379
00:17:23.221 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you,</v>

380
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.790
<v Speaker 4>if you are Arab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they expect this image about,</v>

381
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.870
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an,</v>

382
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.570
<v Speaker 4>he's a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he must hate the west.</v>

383
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 4>He must be very angry against the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States about what Bush did to Iraq.</v>

384
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 4>And they must hate capitalism and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>must all this stuff.</v>

385
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.523
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't fit into that narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're immediately going to be attacked </v>

386
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.443
<v Speaker 4>as some sort of like uncle Tom or which </v>
<v Speaker 4>is itself racist without them noticing </v>

387
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:52.681
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

388
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:53.514
<v Speaker 4>That's what I keep saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're actually using real racism </v>

389
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:58.770
<v Speaker 4>because they're not judging you by </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's in your mind.</v>

390
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:02.580
<v Speaker 4>They're judging you by what they think </v>
<v Speaker 4>of King is like rolling as a grave right</v>

391
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.810
<v Speaker 4>now because it's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

392
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:05.683
<v Speaker 4>so that's actually one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult things I found over here is </v>

393
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:10.650
<v Speaker 4>that how come you don't subscribe to my </v>
<v Speaker 4>order date?</v>

394
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.573
<v Speaker 4>My notions of who you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm like I'm individually as you </v>

395
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:15.801
<v Speaker 4>are and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

396
00:18:15.801 --> 00:18:20.130
<v Speaker 4>and now like we can see it in the US </v>
<v Speaker 4>elections in which I've seen many people</v>

397
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 4>on both sides I would say especially I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say on the far left who are like,</v>

398
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:26.580
<v Speaker 4>how can you as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a black,</v>

399
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 4>not support Bernie or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

400
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 4>While black people have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have,</v>

401
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.583
<v Speaker 4>they have agency and they may rush </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationally think of supporting one </v>

402
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 4>person over the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can disagree with them,</v>

403
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.700
<v Speaker 4>but that's completely fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to say like,</v>

404
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 4>why is he as a black person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't say that about a white person,</v>

405
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:42.624
<v Speaker 4>they'll say like maybe support trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like coming again from white people </v>

406
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:47.604
<v Speaker 4>on the left see a critical race theory </v>
<v Speaker 4>from like White Guilt University of </v>

407
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.793
<v Speaker 4>California and they are suddenly now </v>
<v Speaker 4>experts of race relations and what the </v>

408
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.640
<v Speaker 4>dynamics of the Middle East are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

409
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.520
<v Speaker 4>And they project themselves as being the</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectuals.</v>

410
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.413
<v Speaker 4>So that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because we talked so much about the </v>

411
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Middle East and we talk about extremism </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Islam and whatever,</v>

412
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 4>I see a very specific reason why you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

413
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having left Singapore,</v>

414
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 4>having,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

415
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.510
<v Speaker 4>believing in secular values and atheism </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that,</v>

416
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.350
<v Speaker 4>do you find some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that soft bigotry of low expectations</v>

417
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 3>that we talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

418
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.223
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact I'm probably a beneficiary of </v>

419
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 3>have high expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

420
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>

421
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.960
<v Speaker 3>that joke that Chris Rock made at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Oscars with the little kids.</v>

422
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the little accountants and,</v>

423
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:38.970
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some reason the,</v>

424
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:39.804
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Asian community was really up in </v>

425
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:41.664
<v Speaker 3>arms about that stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though it's a positive three </v>

426
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 3>positive stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So w,</v>

427
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.140
<v Speaker 3>what did you feel when you heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

428
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.133
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did get into some online fights </v>

429
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:55.161
<v Speaker 3>about this because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his face all says because of your race,</v>

430
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like seemingly Asian person,</v>

431
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 3>you should be finding this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive.</v>

432
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.440
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't laugh at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should,</v>

433
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sale and rally against an end sort of,</v>

434
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deny as stereotypes.</v>

435
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Forgetting that this is in the context </v>
<v Speaker 3>of humor.</v>

436
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

437
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:16.923
<v Speaker 3>and the same thing with what Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sacha Baron Cohen said about the little </v>

438
00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 3>minions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

439
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Speaker 3>that really blew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even Jeremy Lin,</v>

440
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:28.310
<v Speaker 3>the basketballs got into that and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's just,</v>

441
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

442
00:20:29.331 --> 00:20:31.440
<v Speaker 3>I was asking people rhetorically like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

443
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.333
<v Speaker 3>what happens to comedy if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just take all stereotypes out of </v>

444
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be angry at South Park.</v>

445
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.040
<v Speaker 3>You have to be angry at snl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>

446
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole season,</v>

447
00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:42.950
<v Speaker 4>did you guys watch South Park this </v>
<v Speaker 4>season?</v>

448
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole season,</v>

449
00:20:44.271 --> 00:20:46.100
<v Speaker 4>I think it might've been the best season</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

450
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.823
<v Speaker 4>Literally</v>

451
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.720
<v Speaker 2>the entire season was dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch it.</v>

452
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:51.851
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

453
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:55.690
<v Speaker 2>So the whole season was dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting these exact ideas.</v>

454
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

455
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.940
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

456
00:20:56.941 --> 00:20:59.250
<v Speaker 3>and the thing about taking a fence is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

457
00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:03.150
<v Speaker 3>I always ask people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who creates the offense,</v>

458
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.043
<v Speaker 3>the offense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who offended by the person </v>

459
00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:07.794
<v Speaker 3>who feels the offense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is the one that actually created it </v>

460
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.420
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't happen in a vacuum.</v>

461
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.353
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a particularly interesting </v>

462
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.360
<v Speaker 2>notion with what you're saying because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stereotypes.</v>

463
00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>So when Chris rock brought out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

464
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 2>or was it three?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

465
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.323
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was actually had a Jewish </v>

466
00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:24.844
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

467
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Jewish people weren't angry,</v>

468
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.250
<v Speaker 2>so just for people that didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they brought out three Asian kids.</v>

469
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:31.084
<v Speaker 2>One of them had a Jewish name and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were supposed to all be like accountant </v>

470
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.613
<v Speaker 2>from price waterhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're all supposed to be really </v>

471
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:37.600
<v Speaker 2>bright accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

472
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.920
<v Speaker 2>But so the stereotype that they're using</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a positive stereotype.</v>

473
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 2>The implication is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

474
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:43.174
<v Speaker 2>these are educated kids that are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go on and be good at math and they </v>

475
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 2>excel academically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

476
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:50.074
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people were upset with you or when </v>

477
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:55.600
<v Speaker 2>you said I'm okay with the humor in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that were upset,</v>

478
00:21:55.601 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 2>what were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were they saying?</v>

479
00:21:56.771 --> 00:21:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Like did they feel that that's causing </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of backlash?</v>

480
00:21:59.130 --> 00:21:59.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

481
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.943
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like the perpetuating of the </v>

482
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:08.250
<v Speaker 3>model minority and they think that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sets up a standard where now every agent</v>

483
00:22:08.251 --> 00:22:09.084
<v Speaker 3>has to live up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're reading too much into </v>

484
00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:12.030
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

485
00:22:12.031 --> 00:22:12.864
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

486
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:13.803
<v Speaker 3>it's just a reflection of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of stereotypes that have a grain of </v>

487
00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:20.880
<v Speaker 3>truth in the case of have a leg who made</v>
<v Speaker 3>that joke about.</v>

488
00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:23.040
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

489
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

490
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.920
<v Speaker 3>this Oscar's is all about diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what about them?</v>

491
00:22:25.921 --> 00:22:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Little yellow guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

492
00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:28.620
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have the little dogs?</v>

493
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.490
<v Speaker 3>And then he paused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody laughed,</v>

494
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody assumed that he was talking</v>

495
00:22:33.931 --> 00:22:36.240
<v Speaker 3>about Asians and then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

496
00:22:36.241 --> 00:22:37.074
<v Speaker 3>you know the minions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the job was actually on you because </v>

497
00:22:39.001 --> 00:22:40.800
<v Speaker 3>you are the ones who did the stereotype </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

498
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.840
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think people,</v>

499
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.100
<v Speaker 3>they just reacted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will like,</v>

500
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg saying,</v>

501
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:47.880
<v Speaker 3>you know that Asians have small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small dogs,</v>

502
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.773
<v Speaker 3>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually this is the anatomy of </v>

503
00:22:50.971 --> 00:22:54.570
<v Speaker 3>humor and if you don't know Ali g as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>character and,</v>

504
00:22:54.571 --> 00:22:56.490
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how he's playing off his humor,</v>

505
00:22:56.491 --> 00:22:57.610
<v Speaker 3>he's actually saying you're the one who</v>

506
00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.300
<v Speaker 2>stereotyping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just to be clear,</v>

507
00:22:59.301 --> 00:23:00.134
<v Speaker 2>he did something really clever there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he took you one way or made you </v>

508
00:23:02.451 --> 00:23:04.520
<v Speaker 2>laugh and then immediately takes you the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other place.</v>

509
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.990
<v Speaker 2>So you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on you,</v>

510
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.043
<v Speaker 3>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the one who stereotyped left and </v>

511
00:23:08.371 --> 00:23:10.820
<v Speaker 3>you thought that he meant Asian people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

512
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I think all of this is directly linked </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the authoritarianism stuff,</v>

513
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.073
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you came from an authoritarian </v>

514
00:23:18.031 --> 00:23:20.460
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were not allowed to say,</v>

515
00:23:20.461 --> 00:23:21.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

516
00:23:21.011 --> 00:23:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a free thinker in a secularist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>

517
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.540
<v Speaker 2>you've laid out why you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

518
00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:25.374
<v Speaker 2>lived under an authoritarian rule and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now we see this happening here and I'm </v>

519
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.913
<v Speaker 2>firmly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe that we are in like </v>

520
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.390
<v Speaker 2>some really murky waters in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and in the West in general.</v>

521
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.090
<v Speaker 2>So what do we do to fight this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

522
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean there a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I do my step because now it is,</v>

523
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>is coming to our lines here and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening over there</v>

524
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.963
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to what's happening over </v>

525
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:49.971
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

526
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:54.971
<v Speaker 4>I think the best solution for is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>support the values that I think to be on</v>

527
00:23:55.941 --> 00:23:56.774
<v Speaker 4>the right side of history on this battle</v>
<v Speaker 4>between authoritarianism and I would </v>

528
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:05.550
<v Speaker 4>include a theocratic fascism in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the umbrella and uh,</v>

529
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.130
<v Speaker 4>and the values of John Stuart Mill and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jefferson and,</v>

530
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:11.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the values of,</v>

531
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.600
<v Speaker 4>of the free man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you think,</v>

532
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.060
<v Speaker 2>do you guys think that those are values </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the left anywhere?</v>

533
00:24:16.061 --> 00:24:18.540
<v Speaker 2>When you think of John Stuart Mill or </v>
<v Speaker 2>classic liberalism?</v>

534
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.950
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that that's not even a </v>
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>

535
00:24:20.951 --> 00:24:21.784
<v Speaker 2>That really.</v>

536
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.753
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the last has shifted and the </v>

537
00:24:24.901 --> 00:24:27.740
<v Speaker 4>right has shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like now we live in a moment.</v>

538
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.653
<v Speaker 4>You can look at the elections,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can see for yourself like we </v>

539
00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:33.510
<v Speaker 4>live in a very polarized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

540
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.700
<v Speaker 4>there's no discussion about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can start by whether it's Islam</v>

541
00:24:38.881 --> 00:24:41.550
<v Speaker 4>or abortion or gun control or a glass of</v>
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

542
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.000
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well the things that I like because like</v>

543
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:45.843
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a dogma and like you can actually </v>

544
00:24:47.251 --> 00:24:48.084
<v Speaker 4>know someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone position from abortion about </v>

545
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 4>abortion and gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ask them questions,</v>

546
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.533
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or don't like what do you think about </v>

547
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.083
<v Speaker 4>abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can actually know that a </v>

548
00:24:56.041 --> 00:24:56.874
<v Speaker 4>position on gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's like now is like this </v>

549
00:24:59.281 --> 00:25:03.190
<v Speaker 4>polarization of like dogmatism of the 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>commandments of the left,</v>

550
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:07.020
<v Speaker 4>the 10 commandments of the riots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that both sides have kind</v>

551
00:25:07.021 --> 00:25:09.780
<v Speaker 4>of lost principles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've even the quote unquote the right.</v>

552
00:25:09.781 --> 00:25:12.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean they are supposedly about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>free market,</v>

553
00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:16.030
<v Speaker 4>but they want to police people's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vagina and a job.</v>

554
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.360
<v Speaker 4>They are not as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not as a free,</v>

555
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they as they claim to be.</v>

556
00:25:21.091 --> 00:25:24.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean they want to police marriage and </v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage equality.</v>

557
00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:25.524
<v Speaker 4>They want to police a woman's </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproductive rights and the stuff and </v>

558
00:25:28.231 --> 00:25:30.140
<v Speaker 4>the left one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supposedly they'll.</v>

559
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.070
<v Speaker 4>The guys are free speech one to how the </v>
<v Speaker 4>police.</v>

560
00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.340
<v Speaker 2>The sad part here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're jumping onto the political side</v>

561
00:25:36.341 --> 00:25:37.174
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the one guy who wanted smaller </v>

562
00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:39.694
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one guy who wanted rand Paul who </v>

563
00:25:41.981 --> 00:25:42.814
<v Speaker 2>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's as close to a libertarian that </v>

564
00:25:44.831 --> 00:25:48.280
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get into the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties and I had Gary Johnson on here a</v>

565
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.870
<v Speaker 2>couple weeks ago who's running under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian ticket.</v>

566
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>

567
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Good luck for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

568
00:25:53.231 --> 00:25:56.980
<v Speaker 2>we still don't have a legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly legitimate third party yet,</v>

569
00:25:56.981 --> 00:25:59.230
<v Speaker 2>but I think that after the craziness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this year,</v>

570
00:25:59.231 --> 00:26:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I actually think it's possible for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 20,</v>

571
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.570
<v Speaker 2>but is that the real fault?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we focus on the left,</v>

572
00:26:04.571 --> 00:26:06.410
<v Speaker 2>but there was a moment that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

573
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Could have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

574
00:26:07.781 --> 00:26:08.614
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is the guy that we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to because he's got some of our </v>

575
00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:14.790
<v Speaker 2>principals and then they kicked him out </v>
<v Speaker 2>after one bad caucus.</v>

576
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.430
<v Speaker 3>I think it was actually Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremism.</v>

577
00:26:18.431 --> 00:26:19.264
<v Speaker 3>What was going on in the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really did rand Paul's campaign in </v>

578
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.770
<v Speaker 3>the rise of Isis and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

579
00:26:23.771 --> 00:26:26.080
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the havoc that was racking the refugees.</v>

580
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.453
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of implicated that the United </v>

581
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.130
<v Speaker 3>States couldn't be isolationists and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>libertarian position is to just,</v>

582
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:34.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold back.</v>

583
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.880
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's what kind of killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rand Paul's Rand Paul said.</v>

584
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting because when I had </v>

585
00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:41.654
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what his policy was on </v>

586
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

587
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.843
<v Speaker 4>of the libertarian really you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to be so like just like </v>

588
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:48.864
<v Speaker 4>this and so ron everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I asked him about some Middle </v>

589
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 4>East stuff and some foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

590
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.090
<v Speaker 4>he actually did feel that there is still</v>
<v Speaker 4>a role for the United States.</v>

591
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Didn't really lay out exactly what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was really interesting.</v>

592
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:05.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean with the Libertarian Party as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

593
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.043
<v Speaker 4>as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this concept of isolationism </v>

594
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.733
<v Speaker 4>which are very strong in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I thing is like if you're not </v>

595
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:14.700
<v Speaker 4>interested in the Middle East and Middle</v>
<v Speaker 4>East is interested in us,</v>

596
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.930
<v Speaker 4>but what happens in the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't.</v>

597
00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:17.853
<v Speaker 4>It's not Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what happens in Iraq doesn't stay </v>

598
00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.304
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though we have the same mother </v>

599
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.950
<v Speaker 4>between Vegas and Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one thing that does,</v>

600
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.640
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't stay over there.</v>

601
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:27.893
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's one thing is Islamic </v>

602
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:30.144
<v Speaker 4>extremism and I mean because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>good things about Islam and I always </v>

603
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 4>admitted like it is the least price </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's religion and it is very universal</v>

604
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 4>and it always talks about universal </v>
<v Speaker 4>values.</v>

605
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the famous quotes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Prophet Mohammad in which he said,</v>

606
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.810
<v Speaker 4>but there's no difference between Arab </v>
<v Speaker 4>and non Arab except by I'm like,</v>

607
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.570
<v Speaker 4>I think how much faithful he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

608
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.190
<v Speaker 4>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>

609
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.163
<v Speaker 4>well that's universal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Except he was saying you have to </v>

610
00:27:53.821 --> 00:27:55.210
<v Speaker 4>convert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

611
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.550
<v Speaker 4>Religion transcend borders is that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be a,</v>

612
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.250
<v Speaker 4>like the values of Islam can't transcend</v>
<v Speaker 4>borders.</v>

613
00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Not like a tribal religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say like Judaism is with,</v>

614
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.433
<v Speaker 4>with Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what effects what's happening in the </v>

615
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.283
<v Speaker 4>Middle East can effect like many people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are recruiters for Isis are in the </v>

616
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:14.803
<v Speaker 4>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the recruiting on the Internet for </v>

617
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:16.434
<v Speaker 4>people living in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm failing to see how you see this </v>

618
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 4>as a positive thing because it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>that showing why it's spreading.</v>

619
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.850
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a.</v>

620
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a double edged sword is that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>good thing that is not racist,</v>

621
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:28.390
<v Speaker 4>but it's a bad thing that is universal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

622
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.640
<v Speaker 4>To do that as a little more bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But back to the isolation.</v>

623
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 4>The isolation is believed that if we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>just secure the borders,</v>

624
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:42.330
<v Speaker 4>if you can ban everybody from entering </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>

625
00:28:42.331 --> 00:28:43.164
<v Speaker 4>Even the Libertarians are clinical </v>
<v Speaker 4>educator because they believe in open </v>

626
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:48.180
<v Speaker 4>borders as the same time reducing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>welfare state.</v>

627
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:50.040
<v Speaker 4>So in that way we can accept more </v>
<v Speaker 4>immigrants.</v>

628
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are we going to deal with that?</v>

629
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.173
<v Speaker 4>Like with Islamic extremism rising gap </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the refugees coming in with people </v>

630
00:28:57.121 --> 00:28:57.954
<v Speaker 4>from the West getting recruited to join </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorist groups that may actually make </v>

631
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 4>attacks here in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Paris attacks and Charlie Hebdo and</v>

632
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.530
<v Speaker 4>even like now some like my friend just </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently came from Germany.</v>

633
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:10.890
<v Speaker 4>She's a woman from Afghanistan and she </v>
<v Speaker 4>said like in,</v>

634
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:16.140
<v Speaker 4>in some hotels telling data are telling </v>
<v Speaker 4>women not to go out at night out of fear</v>

635
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.543
<v Speaker 4>of being harassed by the newcomers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>which then ultimately just strengthens </v>

636
00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:23.070
<v Speaker 4>the far right.</v>

637
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tweeted this morning,</v>

638
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:25.284
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw an article in Germany that at one </v>

639
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 4>of the public pools were allowed lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The migrants are going to.</v>

640
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:30.953
<v Speaker 4>That there were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were a lot of men that were </v>

641
00:29:32.191 --> 00:29:34.860
<v Speaker 4>attacking women and children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now they're.</v>

642
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.130
<v Speaker 4>Their resolution is that they're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to segregate by sex,</v>

643
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird way now the government came in and</v>

644
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.440
<v Speaker 4>the most sort of the thing that religion</v>
<v Speaker 4>would want the most.</v>

645
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going to separate men and </v>
<v Speaker 4>women and guess what?</v>

646
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.343
<v Speaker 4>When people aren't having sex as Bill </v>
<v Speaker 4>Maher would say that sort of fertile </v>

647
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:55.171
<v Speaker 4>ground for extremists or extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the horseshoe theory is like one</v>

648
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:57.950
<v Speaker 4>of the best way to play and sex is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

649
00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.053
<v Speaker 4>Not also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They also theater is like how much they </v>

650
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:04.450
<v Speaker 4>feed into each other is that the more </v>
<v Speaker 4>people say that there is no problem with</v>

651
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more people on the far right will be</v>

652
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.833
<v Speaker 4>getting more powerful because whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's a correlation between </v>

653
00:30:10.071 --> 00:30:12.910
<v Speaker 4>the rise of terrorist attacks and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rise of far right groups,</v>

654
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:13.744
<v Speaker 4>another sunrise grows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the need for them to get mobilized </v>

655
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.133
<v Speaker 4>and like people like trump or people </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the edl and defense league or a </v>

656
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.580
<v Speaker 4>material upon the fronds that when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Paris attacks happened,</v>

657
00:30:24.581 --> 00:30:26.350
<v Speaker 4>that moment is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's get mobilized.</v>

658
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.161
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

659
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're losing our way of life and,</v>

660
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:30.394
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean this is one of the biggest </v>

661
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:33.754
<v Speaker 4>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were talking about it a few days </v>

662
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.700
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that with the rise of the far right,</v>

663
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:39.370
<v Speaker 4>when they start quote unquote killing </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslims,</v>

664
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.850
<v Speaker 4>I'd want attack Muslims and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not all that.</v>

665
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 4>They're attacking people who look Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 4>as well there.</v>

666
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:44.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

667
00:30:44.971 --> 00:30:48.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't have no one's Hashtag on my face</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying I'm a Muslim,</v>

668
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.160
<v Speaker 4>but even I'm not going to advocate for </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacking Muslims either.</v>

669
00:30:51.161 --> 00:30:52.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my parents are Muslims,</v>

670
00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:54.520
<v Speaker 4>but I grew up with Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love many of them,</v>

671
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.473
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's happening is that when people </v>

672
00:30:57.161 --> 00:30:57.994
<v Speaker 4>do not acknowledge the problem there is </v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys are going to be and they're </v>

673
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.203
<v Speaker 4>going to be attacking six and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be attacking anybody who looks </v>

674
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:03.920
<v Speaker 4>Brown.</v>

675
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.753
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the problem is that there </v>

676
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.110
<v Speaker 4>absolutely are true racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

677
00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Speaker 4>There absolutely are true bigots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

678
00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:11.740
<v Speaker 4>that's why I had Tommy Robinson on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

679
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:12.574
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree with everything he says </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't fully understand everything </v>

680
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 4>about what's going on in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the UK and Europe,</v>

681
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:19.540
<v Speaker 4>but I'm trying to learn and I know he </v>
<v Speaker 4>had tried to,</v>

682
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.553
<v Speaker 4>at least from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>separated himself from some of the more </v>

683
00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:24.940
<v Speaker 4>racist elements of the EDL and some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those organizations.</v>

684
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 4>So I thought it was worthy of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

685
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 4>But I think this is a good segue to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something you said earlier.</v>

686
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 4>So a certain in Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of authoritarianism.</v>

687
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:37.351
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like it made people coexist </v>
<v Speaker 4>and is that sort of on the surface?</v>

688
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:39.400
<v Speaker 4>So is that sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>

689
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 4>like you got to thread that needle </v>
<v Speaker 4>really carefully,</v>

690
00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:42.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

691
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

692
00:31:43.561 --> 00:31:44.340
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

693
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.630
<v Speaker 3>it ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

694
00:31:45.631 --> 00:31:46.464
<v Speaker 3>it's a political philosophy question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also what is the purpose of </v>

695
00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:50.160
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

696
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.333
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it to maintain the most stable </v>

697
00:31:53.071 --> 00:31:55.860
<v Speaker 3>society?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it to raise the standard of living of</v>

698
00:31:55.861 --> 00:31:56.694
<v Speaker 3>most people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do the ends ultimately justify the </v>

699
00:31:59.521 --> 00:32:02.640
<v Speaker 3>means because to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

700
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.200
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

701
00:32:04.201 --> 00:32:05.034
<v Speaker 3>like we in 2007 we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you make racist comments on your </v>

702
00:32:08.941 --> 00:32:10.770
<v Speaker 3>blog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be jailed.</v>

703
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're not free to,</v>

704
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.630
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make these comments and how,</v>

705
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.430
<v Speaker 3>how else does that manifest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

706
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:18.503
<v Speaker 3>So in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody can say any racist thing they </v>

707
00:32:20.611 --> 00:32:21.444
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

708
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.400
<v Speaker 3>you'll never be thrown into jail for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that anyway.</v>

709
00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 4>You might be booted off twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also,</v>

710
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean the word racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

711
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.920
<v Speaker 4>it could be perceived as racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can get you in jail.</v>

712
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.003
<v Speaker 4>There's a subtly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we probably all know what racism </v>

713
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.943
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be something that they say </v>

714
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:38.624
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

715
00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 4>because people could be something that,</v>

716
00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.910
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely it's a good racism for me,</v>

717
00:32:42.911 --> 00:32:43.744
<v Speaker 3>but the sedition and blasphemy laws </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially protect also the criticism </v>

718
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.533
<v Speaker 3>of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious institutions from often very </v>

719
00:32:53.021 --> 00:32:54.280
<v Speaker 3>necessary criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

720
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like I can't even go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't critique and,</v>

721
00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.113
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates that climate where where </v>

722
00:32:59.681 --> 00:33:00.514
<v Speaker 3>people just don't question because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're afraid and they don't talk </v>

723
00:33:03.371 --> 00:33:03.941
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

724
00:33:03.941 --> 00:33:07.570
<v Speaker 3>they're a decent safe spaces right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not go talking about.</v>

725
00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't,</v>

726
00:33:10.721 --> 00:33:13.930
<v Speaker 3>we can discuss racism very well in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Singapore.</v>

727
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a very sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not talk about it.</v>

728
00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.403
<v Speaker 3>So people tread on eggshells and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean it's funny because I feel </v>

729
00:33:20.711 --> 00:33:24.460
<v Speaker 3>like I sort of escaped that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That scenario,</v>

730
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:25.294
<v Speaker 3>like the right sort of top down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>government instituted curtailing of the </v>

731
00:33:29.111 --> 00:33:33.040
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech come to theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s and slowly on campuses.</v>

732
00:33:33.041 --> 00:33:33.874
<v Speaker 3>What starts happening is now the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking for the same thing the students </v>

733
00:33:36.341 --> 00:33:37.174
<v Speaker 3>are asking for safe spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you said about the segregation in </v>

734
00:33:39.371 --> 00:33:40.204
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

735
00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.493
<v Speaker 3>Essentially that's what religion is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is creating a safe space between </v>

736
00:33:44.021 --> 00:33:44.854
<v Speaker 3>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

737
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.610
<v Speaker 3>So like what phase also at the horseshoe</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory does come together,</v>

738
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let the left and the right extreme left </v>

739
00:33:51.341 --> 00:33:54.340
<v Speaker 3>the effectively are kind of achieving </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same result.</v>

740
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.100
<v Speaker 4>But also like worth mentioning about </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Singapore even like I can't believe</v>

741
00:33:59.101 --> 00:33:59.934
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually from Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually on the same continent and </v>

742
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:08.290
<v Speaker 4>Asia and I'll try to keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm judging you for now is that within a</v>

743
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 4>eastern cultures there is a lot of sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>of collectivism and the and the concepts</v>

744
00:34:14.551 --> 00:34:19.551
<v Speaker 4>of tribalism that makes it easier for </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaders to tell them like the philosophy</v>

745
00:34:19.951 --> 00:34:24.870
<v Speaker 4>of Buddhism and Confucianism that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's others respect to the leader and</v>

746
00:34:24.871 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like I said,</v>

747
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:28.490
<v Speaker 4>it's generally like a culture of self in</v>
<v Speaker 4>China is like a.</v>

748
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:29.853
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what's happening is that is open to </v>

749
00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.713
<v Speaker 4>people like when they talk about change </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Middle East and things of that </v>

750
00:34:33.511 --> 00:34:35.070
<v Speaker 4>sort and Jolene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eastern culture,</v>

751
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.450
<v Speaker 4>you will see that you don't need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>create a critical mass because you don't</v>

752
00:34:39.451 --> 00:34:41.820
<v Speaker 4>need to check most of individuals </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's a collective culture.</v>

753
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.653
<v Speaker 4>If you change the leader and the leader </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling people to look at Iraq for </v>

754
00:34:45.931 --> 00:34:46.764
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within,</v>

755
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.260
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the history of rock the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last 50 years,</v>

756
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 4>you'll see 50 years ago women were free </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some places are in Europe,</v>

757
00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:54.884
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the moment that the leadership </v>

758
00:34:56.551 --> 00:34:58.860
<v Speaker 4>change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they killed some civil society activists</v>

759
00:34:58.861 --> 00:34:59.694
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The moment everybody start worshiping </v>

760
00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:02.600
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

761
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.540
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>

762
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.380
<v Speaker 4>So did you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

763
00:35:05.381 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to interrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but did you see this meme about a,</v>

764
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.100
<v Speaker 4>there was about 30 women from different </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries,</v>

765
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.990
<v Speaker 4>you saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 women are 50 women,</v>

766
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:16.620
<v Speaker 4>may be from different countries at </v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly Arab countries or at least Muslim</v>

767
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.010
<v Speaker 4>majority countries showing what their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what their actual dress,</v>

768
00:35:20.011 --> 00:35:22.860
<v Speaker 4>the indigenous dress that is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be in.</v>

769
00:35:22.861 --> 00:35:23.694
<v Speaker 4>It's all vibrant and they are free in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their clothes and it says it's not </v>

770
00:35:26.881 --> 00:35:27.870
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be this.</v>

771
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:28.703
<v Speaker 4>And then they show with one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that like what ideology of </v>

772
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:36.120
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and our hub is in what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>called used to call himself.</v>

773
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.033
<v Speaker 4>I'm not the web,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called himself a Muslim reformer </v>

774
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.533
<v Speaker 4>that he wanted to make all the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 4>world homogeneous and that's part of </v>

775
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.130
<v Speaker 4>some of his success because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>appealing to this concept that Oh,</v>

776
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 4>we all have different than humans and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different cultures and stuff,</v>

777
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.400
<v Speaker 4>but yet all my bringing all of you under</v>
<v Speaker 4>one caliphate all under one ideology and</v>

778
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.320
<v Speaker 4>all of them I need to order the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>address and all.</v>

779
00:35:58.321 --> 00:35:59.154
<v Speaker 4>Many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's appealing to some people and </v>

780
00:36:00.731 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 4>not appealing to those who are cultured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's another reason it has been to</v>

781
00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:05.484
<v Speaker 4>some extent successful because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>appeals to the people who want to have </v>

782
00:36:08.641 --> 00:36:09.474
<v Speaker 4>the collective mindset to want to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like part of one umbrella and one </v>

783
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 4>leadership.</v>

784
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.690
<v Speaker 4>And that's what an Arabic is called </v>
<v Speaker 4>Omar,</v>

785
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.060
<v Speaker 4>Omar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Islamic Omar,</v>

786
00:36:17.061 --> 00:36:17.894
<v Speaker 4>the Arabic Omar come from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that this concept of one leadership </v>

787
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:22.620
<v Speaker 4>in one community and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of that.</v>

788
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 4>So the three of us sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three secular people,</v>

789
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 4>atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

790
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.733
<v Speaker 4>So you grew up methodist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know that until we sat </v>

791
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:32.130
<v Speaker 4>down just now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You grew up Muslim,</v>

792
00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:32.964
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's to some extent to where my </v>

793
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Speaker 4>parents are liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

794
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 4>But I grew up in a Muslim culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly in a Muslim culture.</v>

795
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.950
<v Speaker 4>I grew up Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still consider myself Jewish,</v>

796
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not a believer in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

797
00:36:42.661 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Speaker 4>in a magical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't believe in a talking donkey.</v>

798
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in the talking donkey or</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fire.</v>

799
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:49.220
<v Speaker 4>They talked to her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff and the way,</v>

800
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

801
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:51.323
<v Speaker 4>but it's ideas that brought us all here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I wanted to have youtube </v>

802
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.940
<v Speaker 4>on together because I think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really interesting.</v>

803
00:36:56.941 --> 00:37:00.830
<v Speaker 4>It shows that these concepts are </v>
<v Speaker 4>irrelevant,</v>

804
00:37:00.831 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these concepts,</v>

805
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.690
<v Speaker 4>transcend borders and all of that stuff.</v>

806
00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.053
<v Speaker 3>I really like what really interested me </v>
<v Speaker 3>about sort of joining forces with </v>

807
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.373
<v Speaker 3>Faisal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially right now with the shift </v>

808
00:37:12.191 --> 00:37:13.990
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's doing with a human rights.</v>

809
00:37:13.991 --> 00:37:18.370
<v Speaker 3>He's focusing not just on the atheist </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement or the secular movement.</v>

810
00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can we do about it?</v>

811
00:37:20.261 --> 00:37:25.261
<v Speaker 3>So he's now working in human rights and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I'm so supportive of that</v>

812
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.110
<v Speaker 3>and want to be involved in that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because for me,</v>

813
00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in a country where I think one</v>

814
00:37:31.991 --> 00:37:32.824
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

815
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.770
<v Speaker 3>the founding father of Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Lee Kuan Yew,</v>

816
00:37:35.771 --> 00:37:36.970
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who recently passed away,</v>

817
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.673
<v Speaker 3>one of the most dangerous legacies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably one of the greatest </v>

818
00:37:40.451 --> 00:37:42.460
<v Speaker 3>statesmen modern statesman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

819
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:43.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

820
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:48.550
<v Speaker 3>And he's built a country that went from </v>
<v Speaker 3>third world to first world in just three</v>

821
00:37:48.551 --> 00:37:50.350
<v Speaker 3>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a feat that,</v>

822
00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:51.311
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

823
00:37:51.311 --> 00:37:53.020
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing what he's done for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

824
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:55.690
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the other hand,</v>

825
00:37:55.691 --> 00:37:56.524
<v Speaker 3>he sort of legitimize this term which </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of bothers me is he says that it's </v>

826
00:38:00.341 --> 00:38:05.341
<v Speaker 3>called Asian values that because Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of his history and culture,</v>

827
00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the western ideas of,</v>

828
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:10.811
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

829
00:38:10.811 --> 00:38:11.644
<v Speaker 3>liberal democracy cannot apply and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't fit well within the culture and </v>

830
00:38:16.391 --> 00:38:18.820
<v Speaker 3>he uses confucianism as a bulwark </v>
<v Speaker 3>against that,</v>

831
00:38:18.821 --> 00:38:21.670
<v Speaker 3>like what he was saying about </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectivism and,</v>

832
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.340
<v Speaker 3>and so it sort of pits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

833
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.470
<v Speaker 3>the West Western ideas and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

834
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:27.610
<v Speaker 3>it's invalid here.</v>

835
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.270
<v Speaker 3>It can work here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me that is cultural relativism.</v>

836
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.011
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

837
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:35.470
<v Speaker 3>it violates human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not,</v>

838
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.560
<v Speaker 3>it's not consistent with this saying he </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying sort of be free but not that free</v>

839
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.070
<v Speaker 3>because that's sort of what will </v>
<v Speaker 3>undermine what we've built.</v>

840
00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Well they are re,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they legitimize their able to legitimize</v>

841
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 3>repressive policies under the guise of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Asian values.</v>

842
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like exceptionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

843
00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.253
<v Speaker 3>we prioritize social harmony and </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosperity over individual freedom and </v>

844
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.040
<v Speaker 3>this is our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

845
00:39:01.041 --> 00:39:01.874
<v Speaker 3>so our policies fit that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think for me that was what was </v>

846
00:39:03.881 --> 00:39:04.714
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous about that idea and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>start seeing it being replicated in </v>

847
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Putin's doing that.</v>

848
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:10.463
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see Jinping and China and they're </v>

849
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.094
<v Speaker 3>taking the leaf out of his book now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating almost like parallel </v>

850
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:23.140
<v Speaker 3>alternative to western democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of that,</v>

851
00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:23.570
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

852
00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:28.220
<v Speaker 4>goes to the way we see Europe having so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many problems right now and we don't see</v>

853
00:39:28.221 --> 00:39:29.900
<v Speaker 4>those problems in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

854
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:34.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean certainly the immigration stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't see that in Russia.</v>

855
00:39:34.311 --> 00:39:37.320
<v Speaker 4>And because of that then it makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably the average European,</v>

856
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.470
<v Speaker 4>it makes poodle look kind of good even </v>
<v Speaker 4>if they don't like.</v>

857
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:42.443
<v Speaker 4>But also it's worth mentioning that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia is not a country worth </v>

858
00:39:45.351 --> 00:39:46.184
<v Speaker 4>immigrating to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they want somebody who's a refugee </v>

859
00:39:51.231 --> 00:39:52.980
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to go somewhere warm,</v>

860
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.673
<v Speaker 4>totally warm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I want to have a country that is </v>

861
00:39:56.241 --> 00:39:57.830
<v Speaker 4>probably different than where I come </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

862
00:39:57.831 --> 00:39:58.664
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But authoritarianism is that I'm in </v>

863
00:39:59.811 --> 00:40:00.644
<v Speaker 4>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously it's much better </v>

864
00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:06.440
<v Speaker 4>economically and much better socially </v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes less people.</v>

865
00:40:06.441 --> 00:40:07.370
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

866
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you have an open border </v>
<v Speaker 4>policy that's,</v>

867
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.843
<v Speaker 4>I think Germany would probably have it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the net not a very strong vetting </v>

868
00:40:15.021 --> 00:40:17.180
<v Speaker 4>system you're going to have because as I</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

869
00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:18.014
<v Speaker 4>there was the rise of far right and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Islamic terrorist attacks and if we are </v>

870
00:40:21.411 --> 00:40:22.244
<v Speaker 4>not going to support the reformers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the liberals are trying to change the </v>

871
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.540
<v Speaker 4>things in the societies because I mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

872
00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:28.374
<v Speaker 4>I wrote an article about the Syrian </v>
<v Speaker 4>refugee crisis and one of the main </v>

873
00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:34.340
<v Speaker 4>issues is that there is no solution to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Syrian refugees going to keep coming.</v>

874
00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.293
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're not going to find the </v>

875
00:40:36.141 --> 00:40:38.030
<v Speaker 4>solution over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's,</v>

876
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.310
<v Speaker 4>this issue is going to continue all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

877
00:40:40.311 --> 00:40:41.144
<v Speaker 4>So not always serious and as obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Libya has also having a problem at </v>

878
00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:48.750
<v Speaker 4>the opiate and all the other countries </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the region and obviously Iraq since a</v>

879
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.560
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

880
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.400
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to find solutions over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

881
00:40:52.401 --> 00:40:56.450
<v Speaker 4>So other than just like a focus on </v>
<v Speaker 4>domestic issues.</v>

882
00:40:56.451 --> 00:40:57.284
<v Speaker 4>That's where like libertarianism fails </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's always deals with the </v>

883
00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:00.074
<v Speaker 4>refugees are coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how can we reduce the amount of </v>

884
00:41:02.181 --> 00:41:03.014
<v Speaker 4>refugees that are coming in for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>region that's by not subtly motor </v>

885
00:41:06.951 --> 00:41:07.784
<v Speaker 4>intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least being on the right side of </v>

886
00:41:09.561 --> 00:41:10.394
<v Speaker 4>history and being with the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>support the values that reduce the </v>

887
00:41:13.041 --> 00:41:13.910
<v Speaker 4>amount of revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

888
00:41:13.911 --> 00:41:17.510
<v Speaker 4>I suspect that most libertarians would </v>
<v Speaker 4>say somebody like Rand Paul would say,</v>

889
00:41:17.511 --> 00:41:19.310
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't for the Iraq war,</v>

890
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.800
<v Speaker 4>so I didn't add to the chaos.</v>

891
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:22.723
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's irrelevant now because here we are </v>

892
00:41:24.261 --> 00:41:26.270
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that is not enough.</v>

893
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this concept of like,</v>

894
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.083
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not a racist is not enough to </v>

895
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.070
<v Speaker 4>two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

896
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:33.720
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

897
00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 4>and I mean people talk about the numbers</v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>

898
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:38.540
<v Speaker 4>I met Saddam Hussein killed hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of people.</v>

899
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 4>If they did not intervene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there will also be hundreds of thousands</v>

900
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:42.374
<v Speaker 4>of people killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

901
00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.650
<v Speaker 4>so just because saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

902
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm against the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't somebody make him a good person?</v>

903
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

904
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about practical solutions </v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

905
00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:51.254
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the war happened and we have to deal </v>

906
00:41:52.491 --> 00:41:52.720
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

907
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a great segway to sort of what</v>

908
00:41:54.551 --> 00:41:55.384
<v Speaker 2>you guys do because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do with movements and what you </v>

909
00:41:57.911 --> 00:42:01.900
<v Speaker 2>guys are doing together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to empower these voices.</v>

910
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just a few weeks ago I had someone on</v>

911
00:42:06.101 --> 00:42:08.980
<v Speaker 2>the show from Iraq or I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

912
00:42:08.981 --> 00:42:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I guess we can give her first name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for now.</v>

913
00:42:10.571 --> 00:42:13.690
<v Speaker 2>So we had moved on the show and she's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>secularist and atheist.</v>

914
00:42:13.691 --> 00:42:15.670
<v Speaker 2>All the things that we all stand up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

915
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.960
<v Speaker 2>she's a minority within a minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

916
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.173
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't get into the major details of </v>

917
00:42:21.491 --> 00:42:22.324
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with her right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But suffice to say that you're helping </v>

918
00:42:23.861 --> 00:42:28.240
<v Speaker 2>facilitate some of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these people are completely ignored.</v>

919
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:29.163
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're ignored by the people that </v>

920
00:42:31.571 --> 00:42:33.580
<v Speaker 2>should care about them the most.</v>

921
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:34.381
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

922
00:42:34.381 --> 00:42:36.790
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that this has no,</v>

923
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.693
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's been what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 years since nine slash 11 happened </v>

924
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:44.420
<v Speaker 4>and it's been the same mentor over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over again that there's no policy change</v>

925
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 4>of who exactly the people we should </v>
<v Speaker 4>start with.</v>

926
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.403
<v Speaker 4>And we have a country like Saudi Arabia </v>
<v Speaker 4>as our ally and we have Qatar that I </v>

927
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.620
<v Speaker 4>recently discovered funds the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brotherhood,</v>

928
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:55.723
<v Speaker 4>which is using slave labor by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to build a cub stadium to actually like </v>

929
00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.400
<v Speaker 4>I want to raise this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is very important.</v>

930
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 4>I the Muslim Brotherhood is actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>much more dangerous than the ideology of</v>

931
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.913
<v Speaker 4>Islam is because they are able to work </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the grassroots level and also they </v>

932
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:11.054
<v Speaker 4>have double faces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's happening is that they want </v>

933
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:14.443
<v Speaker 4>to say hopefully traded the US </v>
<v Speaker 4>government because at that may say made </v>

934
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.203
<v Speaker 4>me sound like a fucking lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they have a lot of people say it </v>

935
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:20.834
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there have been places in in think </v>

936
00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:26.730
<v Speaker 4>tanks and all the shows everywhere that </v>
<v Speaker 4>told,</v>

937
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.440
<v Speaker 4>told the Western world that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that these other guys,</v>

938
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:31.274
<v Speaker 4>the secretaries and stuff are traitors </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're not the good guys and we </v>

939
00:43:34.071 --> 00:43:35.270
<v Speaker 4>should help us.</v>

940
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.880
<v Speaker 4>So that kind of have a block for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a large.</v>

941
00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:40.043
<v Speaker 4>For Charles like Al Jazeera and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have kind of block this concept of </v>

942
00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:44.984
<v Speaker 4>secular Arab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like they wanted to push this </v>

943
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:49.550
<v Speaker 4>image of the authentic Arab of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who,</v>

944
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.633
<v Speaker 4>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are Islamists and we'll have to </v>

945
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:52.874
<v Speaker 4>settle with it while in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my policy and I want to change is that </v>

946
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:57.283
<v Speaker 4>we should change what we need to settle </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we are asking us to subtle when I </v>

947
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:00.973
<v Speaker 4>should not settle with Islamic jihadist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to support those who agree with </v>

948
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:05.800
<v Speaker 4>our values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

949
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.633
<v Speaker 2>Does all of that ring as true to you as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it does to me in terms of that we're </v>

950
00:44:11.021 --> 00:44:12.840
<v Speaker 2>skipping a step here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

951
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:16.960
<v Speaker 2>we're skipping caring about the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because of all,</v>

952
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:18.550
<v Speaker 2>for all the wrong reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

953
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

954
00:44:19.871 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

955
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of extremely symptomatic of,</v>

956
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:25.263
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of criticism now that that's </v>

957
00:44:27.371 --> 00:44:28.510
<v Speaker 3>happening in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the left.</v>

958
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.270
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

959
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.133
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

960
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

961
00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.380
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that also is,</v>

962
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.540
<v Speaker 3>is that it's created like a vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

963
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:40.403
<v Speaker 3>where you have like people like trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was coming in and inciting inciting </v>

964
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.530
<v Speaker 3>so much hate against these people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>blanketing,</v>

965
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 3>blanketing all Muslims and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's just feeding,</v>

966
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:53.910
<v Speaker 3>that's just feeding the ends up eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem.</v>

967
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you come from the academic world.</v>

968
00:44:55.661 --> 00:44:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned at the top of the show,</v>

969
00:44:56.951 --> 00:44:59.880
<v Speaker 2>you got your phd at Mit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

970
00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:03.550
<v Speaker 2>you're on your way to your phd at Mit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics,</v>

971
00:45:03.551 --> 00:45:04.271
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

972
00:45:04.271 --> 00:45:05.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stuff,</v>

973
00:45:05.321 --> 00:45:07.960
<v Speaker 2>you're in the academic world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see this?</v>

974
00:45:07.961 --> 00:45:10.330
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things people struggle with,</v>

975
00:45:10.331 --> 00:45:14.710
<v Speaker 2>is this coming more from the students or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the academics or is it,</v>

976
00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:16.040
<v Speaker 2>is it both?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

977
00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.800
<v Speaker 3>more coming from the students for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

978
00:45:18.801 --> 00:45:22.880
<v Speaker 3>I would say that I'm on campus at Mit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't had that much incidents,</v>

979
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 3>but over over the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

980
00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.210
<v Speaker 3>the t stuff at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

981
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.123
<v Speaker 3>we had had way more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more incidents like recently the </v>

982
00:45:32.091 --> 00:45:33.920
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law school had to change.</v>

983
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.810
<v Speaker 3>I think they're wanting to change their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

984
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.210
<v Speaker 3>their crest because it features three </v>
<v Speaker 3>bushels of wheat.</v>

985
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

986
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.670
<v Speaker 3>and they're also like house masters now </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm at the dorms.</v>

987
00:45:43.671 --> 00:45:45.050
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've lost their titles,</v>

988
00:45:45.051 --> 00:45:48.560
<v Speaker 3>they're called Dean faculty assistance </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

989
00:45:48.561 --> 00:45:49.131
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

990
00:45:49.131 --> 00:45:49.964
<v Speaker 3>the question becomes what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your master's degree or like master of </v>

991
00:45:53.361 --> 00:45:54.140
<v Speaker 3>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

992
00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:55.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just words like that,</v>

993
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:56.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

994
00:45:56.751 --> 00:45:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I posted something recently about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>in chemistry,</v>

995
00:45:59.571 --> 00:46:00.111
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

996
00:46:00.111 --> 00:46:00.944
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest achievements in the </v>

997
00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:06.650
<v Speaker 3>last couple of months was that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually created a new synthetic element</v>

998
00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.813
<v Speaker 3>that stable.</v>

999
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:08.653
<v Speaker 3>So we add it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We completed the seventh row of the </v>

1000
00:46:10.131 --> 00:46:11.960
<v Speaker 3>periodic table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1001
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:16.070
<v Speaker 3>and in the article they called it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>manmade elements,</v>

1002
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had to change.</v>

1003
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.353
<v Speaker 3>So they had to change the word manmade </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people took a lot of offense at </v>

1004
00:46:23.601 --> 00:46:24.260
<v Speaker 3>the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

1005
00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:24.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1006
00:46:24.711 --> 00:46:25.431
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1007
00:46:25.431 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1008
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.130
<v Speaker 3>it's excluding women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It implies,</v>

1009
00:46:28.131 --> 00:46:28.964
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>implies that it's the Patriarchy who's </v>

1010
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:32.000
<v Speaker 3>involved in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1011
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:33.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Latin,</v>

1012
00:46:33.321 --> 00:46:34.154
<v Speaker 3>the word madness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his hand and man mean it doesn't really </v>

1013
00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.030
<v Speaker 3>come from man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1014
00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.030
<v Speaker 3>So the entomology entomology is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1015
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean people take offense firsts and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the first reaction.</v>

1016
00:46:50.121 --> 00:46:52.030
<v Speaker 3>So I was telling face all of this many </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1017
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.660
<v Speaker 3>The problem with what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1018
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:58.360
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the regressive left movement is,</v>

1019
00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.320
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1020
00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:01.520
<v Speaker 3>this desire to see the worst in </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

1021
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:03.770
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt Taylor,</v>

1022
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.900
<v Speaker 3>the Rosetta Scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1023
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Who landed up the comment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1024
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.570
<v Speaker 3>the probe on a comment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1025
00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:11.410
<v Speaker 3>he wore a shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1026
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:16.280
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate for an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the first instinct is to assume,</v>

1027
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.830
<v Speaker 3>can you tell people what the shirt was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just this shirt had,</v>

1028
00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:20.683
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a tessellation of like pin </v>

1029
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 3>up girls with guns or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a cartoon.</v>

1030
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:28.224
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was actually a gift from a female </v>

1031
00:47:29.981 --> 00:47:31.970
<v Speaker 3>artist friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a silly,</v>

1032
00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 3>silly shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't very graphic at all.</v>

1033
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:35.801
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1034
00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:37.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1035
00:47:37.061 --> 00:47:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1036
00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:39.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1037
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wore that,</v>

1038
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>announcing the,</v>

1039
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.493
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the triumphant achievement of his team </v>

1040
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and immediately just the,</v>

1041
00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:54.770
<v Speaker 3>the outcry online forced him into tears </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he had to apologize.</v>

1042
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.153
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know how you make the leap </v>

1043
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:04.111
<v Speaker 3>from guy wearing shirt to just infer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like if I feel like a big part of</v>

1044
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 3>this is wanting to see this rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this racist,</v>

1045
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:11.230
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1046
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:12.123
<v Speaker 3>intent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment you catch something that may </v>

1047
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1048
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:15.903
<v Speaker 3>can be interpreted that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They interpret it in the most extreme </v>

1049
00:48:18.281 --> 00:48:20.470
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the reaction starts there.</v>

1050
00:48:20.471 --> 00:48:24.850
<v Speaker 3>And then the whole outrage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm industrial complex begins online.</v>

1051
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1052
00:48:26.341 --> 00:48:27.670
<v Speaker 3>and then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a cycle,</v>

1053
00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's that little thing,</v>

1054
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:32.550
<v Speaker 3>you find it and then blow up and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people will criticize the blow,</v>

1055
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.440
<v Speaker 3>the people who are bitching about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitching and then,</v>

1056
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:36.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a cycle.</v>

1057
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.233
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you guys make of that mind </v>

1058
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 4>reading portion of this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because psychoanalysis,</v>

1059
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:44.620
<v Speaker 4>phds are being thrown around everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1060
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.454
<v Speaker 4>because when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first episode of the show is you </v>

1061
00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 4>guys know what I had Sam Harris and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said something about the mind reading.</v>

1062
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:53.680
<v Speaker 4>They want to just find something in you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what you just said.</v>

1063
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.500
<v Speaker 4>And once they can find the green of </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1064
00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.100
<v Speaker 4>now they can extrapolate it into every </v>
<v Speaker 4>which way that they want to judge you,</v>

1065
00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.413
<v Speaker 4>which you sold the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think of how rational people actually </v>

1066
00:49:04.121 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 4>operate and how evidence based people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people of science</v>

1067
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.530
<v Speaker 3>that can also just compassion that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is supposedly part of liberalism,</v>

1068
00:49:11.531 --> 00:49:12.364
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be one of the things that we </v>

1069
00:49:13.691 --> 00:49:16.480
<v Speaker 3>aspire to is to actually see the best in</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1070
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just me.</v>

1071
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.633
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't think it's just one of </v>

1072
00:49:19.571 --> 00:49:23.350
<v Speaker 4>the things that make me sad because like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this outrage requires energy,</v>

1073
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:25.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I wish that some of.</v>

1074
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not trying to trivialize that</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience or whatever they may think of</v>

1075
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:30.454
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wish some of that outrage and all </v>

1076
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 4>these hashtags would be used to advocate</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people like Lupe.</v>

1077
00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:39.280
<v Speaker 4>Now for people like Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people who are like,</v>

1078
00:49:39.281 --> 00:49:40.114
<v Speaker 4>I wish that energy of so much out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if they get offended by a </v>

1079
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.023
<v Speaker 4>Halloween costume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish they got offended by a woman </v>

1080
00:49:47.561 --> 00:49:50.530
<v Speaker 4>getting acid thrown in their faces by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Taliban in Pakistan.</v>

1081
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:51.603
<v Speaker 4>I was offended by bloggers getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>beheaded and in Bangladesh like I wish </v>

1082
00:49:56.651 --> 00:50:00.220
<v Speaker 4>that some of that energy and not like </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell them not to talk about this stuff,</v>

1083
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:03.850
<v Speaker 4>but I wish some of that energy at least </v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe just 10 percent.</v>

1084
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:07.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really asking for much like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>like 10 percent is pretty good.</v>

1085
00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:08.604
<v Speaker 4>This is lower than the taxes of trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>and 10 percent if they just use some of </v>

1086
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:15.004
<v Speaker 4>that outreach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of that energy and it creates a </v>

1087
00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:17.434
<v Speaker 4>movement at least of solidarity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want them to donate a million </v>

1088
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.400
<v Speaker 4>dollar or billion dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a moment of solidarity.</v>

1089
00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:23.243
<v Speaker 4>They show that we people in a free </v>
<v Speaker 4>societies side with the values you side </v>

1090
00:50:27.711 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 4>with and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean for me when I was living there,</v>

1091
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:34.580
<v Speaker 4>that's meant a lot to me and when people</v>
<v Speaker 4>told me that I want to replicate that to</v>

1092
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 4>help the folks over there who did that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of solidarity.</v>

1093
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:38.234
<v Speaker 4>And again it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It show rick and tee shirt doesn't </v>

1094
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:44.270
<v Speaker 4>achieve a certain level of narcissism </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

1095
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Because it seems to me that when they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this they're just saying why can't blame</v>

1096
00:50:49.071 --> 00:50:50.150
<v Speaker 4>everything on myself?</v>

1097
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 4>And now that's a problem they want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1098
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:53.540
<v Speaker 4>If they can't link America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something,</v>

1099
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:57.450
<v Speaker 4>it's not even a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that also seems to be a bit of the.</v>

1100
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:58.583
<v Speaker 4>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at like many of the </v>

1101
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.330
<v Speaker 4>definition of racism is power plus </v>
<v Speaker 4>privilege,</v>

1102
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it getting it right?</v>

1103
00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.420
<v Speaker 4>Prevalent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1104
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.940
<v Speaker 4>they because they look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1105
00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:15.350
<v Speaker 4>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they redefined racism.</v>

1106
00:51:15.351 --> 00:51:18.440
<v Speaker 4>So racism is no longer about people </v>
<v Speaker 4>hating of people of other races,</v>

1107
00:51:18.441 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 4>but rather it is who are the people on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the privileged side.</v>

1108
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:23.060
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it has to be.</v>

1109
00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:25.760
<v Speaker 4>So at the top of the pyramid we talked </v>
<v Speaker 4>about last time,</v>

1110
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 4>there is a cisgender white male.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's worse than Isis.</v>

1111
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:32.120
<v Speaker 4>And so then there's probably isis </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're brown.</v>

1112
00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:33.183
<v Speaker 4>Mel's probably the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the social media guys are mostly white </v>

1113
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:39.000
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1114
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:40.243
<v Speaker 4>but the other side is like a pyramid and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the top of the pyramid is white smell </v>

1115
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.760
<v Speaker 4>and they think he is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1116
00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:49.610
<v Speaker 4>So ironically what they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually is that you as an Arab,</v>

1117
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:50.803
<v Speaker 4>as Arab landscape man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could not be racist against me or </v>

1118
00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.360
<v Speaker 4>against me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I know that someone of that,</v>

1119
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.693
<v Speaker 4>an Asian person is probably lined up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very sort of right next to white </v>

1120
00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:06.734
<v Speaker 4>privilege so that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you were endorsing white </v>

1121
00:52:09.741 --> 00:52:13.580
<v Speaker 4>genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be viewed as racist because you</v>

1122
00:52:13.581 --> 00:52:17.270
<v Speaker 4>were being oppressed and that has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually like there was this case,</v>

1123
00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:21.080
<v Speaker 4>I think it was in Goldsmith University </v>
<v Speaker 4>in which one of the students was talking</v>

1124
00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:24.320
<v Speaker 4>about a genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stock white genocide.</v>

1125
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.393
<v Speaker 4>And then she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is my way to surprise my </v>

1126
00:52:27.411 --> 00:52:28.430
<v Speaker 4>grievances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1127
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:33.431
<v Speaker 4>Because there's no other way to get more</v>
<v Speaker 4>creative then.</v>

1128
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.900
<v Speaker 4>And then she said this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not actually racist.</v>

1129
00:52:35.901 --> 00:52:38.210
<v Speaker 4>What I was talking about because I am a </v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

1130
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.320
<v Speaker 4>except the fact that she lives in </v>
<v Speaker 4>London,</v>

1131
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:41.563
<v Speaker 4>she's under privileged and she's trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to suppress our grievances against the </v>

1132
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.640
<v Speaker 4>people from the upper class.</v>

1133
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:47.503
<v Speaker 4>This last night in the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't Bernie say something about how </v>

1134
00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:52.940
<v Speaker 4>white people don't know what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be poor?</v>

1135
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:54.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something of that effect.</v>

1136
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not watch the debate because I was</v>

1137
00:52:56.841 --> 00:52:57.551
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1138
00:52:57.551 --> 00:53:00.440
<v Speaker 4>I saw this coach has been circled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:53:00.441 --> 00:53:02.000
<v Speaker 4>And because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1140
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:04.820
<v Speaker 4>they will say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well mean some of the concept,</v>

1141
00:53:04.821 --> 00:53:05.654
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1142
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:08.120
<v Speaker 4>I agree with some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it's called intersectionality.</v>

1143
00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:08.954
<v Speaker 4>I mean it may accept the fact that many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who say it are crazy nut jobs </v>

1144
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.250
<v Speaker 4>because it has a good concept is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who are,</v>

1145
00:53:16.251 --> 00:53:17.084
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>block have less likely to get jobs </v>

1146
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:21.440
<v Speaker 4>because of their names.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1147
00:53:21.441 --> 00:53:22.274
<v Speaker 4>so it is difficult if you are a block to</v>
<v Speaker 4>raise to middle class then if you're </v>

1148
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 4>otherwise tries to America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there is some truth to this.</v>

1149
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.453
<v Speaker 4>But what is happening is that it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed up with so much baggage of </v>

1150
00:53:34.201 --> 00:53:37.050
<v Speaker 4>bullshit that doesn't make sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1151
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:37.883
<v Speaker 4>Just like when the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the far right talk about we should </v>

1152
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.823
<v Speaker 4>be fearful of all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things except the fact that some of </v>

1153
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.513
<v Speaker 4>infiltration of the Muslim Brotherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these things like because there are </v>

1154
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 4>so insane about so many other things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like whenever there's a shooting,</v>

1155
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 4>Obama's trying to take our guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't take them anywhere.</v>

1156
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:53.874
<v Speaker 4>So whatever they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's happening with </v>

1157
00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.210
<v Speaker 4>intersectionality and the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>far left.</v>

1158
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.510
<v Speaker 4>Some of what they say is through third </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that there are people who are,</v>

1159
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:01.583
<v Speaker 4>because of the rights of men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are studies done even based upon </v>

1160
00:54:04.381 --> 00:54:05.214
<v Speaker 4>the name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if people who have like different </v>

1161
00:54:06.631 --> 00:54:08.460
<v Speaker 4>names,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they sound for it and whatever,</v>

1162
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:10.740
<v Speaker 4>they are less likely to get employment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>

1163
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:14.280
<v Speaker 4>there is a sense of when somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 4>tired to bullshit us,</v>

1164
00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.800
<v Speaker 4>so then they extrapolated into gaze for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hammas and then.</v>

1165
00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.360
<v Speaker 4>Which is valuing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1167
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that is what that is where like the,</v>

1168
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.293
<v Speaker 4>like a huge bag of bullshit is that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these like intersectionality and </v>

1169
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:26.880
<v Speaker 4>critical race theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>critical old,</v>

1170
00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Speaker 4>literally start defending people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have,</v>

1171
00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:29.604
<v Speaker 4>you can because under the name they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>a minority and all of this eventually </v>

1172
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.253
<v Speaker 4>gets like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the destructive when it's all </v>

1173
00:54:36.841 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 4>this stuff mixed together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So as three people here sitting here,</v>

1174
00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:43.080
<v Speaker 4>that all came at different points in our</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives.</v>

1175
00:54:43.081 --> 00:54:45.690
<v Speaker 4>So I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a third generation American.</v>

1176
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.673
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys are first generation but </v>

1177
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.550
<v Speaker 4>different skin colors and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that stuff,</v>

1178
00:54:50.551 --> 00:54:52.380
<v Speaker 4>we're putting it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not fooling anybody.</v>

1179
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:54.180
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sort of touched on this earlier,</v>

1180
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:55.014
<v Speaker 4>but American exceptionalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe in American </v>

1181
00:54:57.871 --> 00:55:00.220
<v Speaker 4>exceptionalism?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I get all right.</v>

1182
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.230
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>

1183
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:02.040
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1184
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:06.840
<v Speaker 3>tell me why I like this quote by Bill </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton and he said whatever is wrong in</v>

1185
00:55:06.841 --> 00:55:09.780
<v Speaker 3>America can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be fixed by what's rights in America</v>

1186
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.680
<v Speaker 3>and as a stance now before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>elections,</v>

1187
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.990
<v Speaker 3>I can say that with a straight face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:19.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1189
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:21.420
<v Speaker 3>I've always been a free speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutist.</v>

1190
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's,</v>

1191
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:27.870
<v Speaker 3>it's something that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if human dignities to be upheld,</v>

1192
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:31.470
<v Speaker 3>we should be free to express ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just always a basic human right.</v>

1193
00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is no other country other than</v>

1194
00:55:35.191 --> 00:55:38.050
<v Speaker 3>the United States that upholds that </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolutely.</v>

1195
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:38.933
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1196
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:40.223
<v Speaker 4>so doesn't that directly correlate to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything you do as a secularist and </v>

1197
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:48.920
<v Speaker 4>know what it was like to not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>express all those freedoms?</v>

1198
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.083
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I prefaced it by saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're all different races and all </v>

1199
00:55:52.551 --> 00:55:55.610
<v Speaker 4>that is that we all have the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity here.</v>

1200
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:56.660
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1201
00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:57.591
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1202
00:55:57.591 --> 00:55:58.550
<v Speaker 4>but people don't lift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like,</v>

1203
00:55:58.551 --> 00:55:59.384
<v Speaker 4>if you say American,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe in American </v>

1204
00:56:00.531 --> 00:56:02.120
<v Speaker 4>exceptionalism?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

1205
00:56:02.121 --> 00:56:02.954
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't thought about it that I'm </v>

1206
00:56:03.771 --> 00:56:04.604
<v Speaker 4>putting you on the spot here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going to get the left to hate </v>

1207
00:56:06.141 --> 00:56:07.310
<v Speaker 4>you even more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:56:07.311 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1209
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:09.950
<v Speaker 4>I think honestly that good job </v>
<v Speaker 4>interview,</v>

1210
00:56:09.951 --> 00:56:10.784
<v Speaker 4>but I think I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really depends on what you </v>

1211
00:56:14.181 --> 00:56:17.820
<v Speaker 4>mean by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People from all over the world.</v>

1212
00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in New York City and uh,</v>

1213
00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:21.163
<v Speaker 4>I can see people from tons of living </v>
<v Speaker 4>together for the most part peacefully </v>

1214
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 4>and trying living under one system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one umbrella.</v>

1215
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:31.241
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1216
00:56:31.241 --> 00:56:32.074
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a wonderful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think America itself is a wonderful </v>

1217
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:34.744
<v Speaker 4>idea is that despite the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously the history of it was not as </v>

1218
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 4>beautiful as it as I wish it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean Jefferson,</v>

1219
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:42.544
<v Speaker 4>who was one of my heroes called America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kind of experiments is that let's </v>

1220
00:56:46.991 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 4>put these values and see how they work </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1221
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:54.220
<v Speaker 4>I think for the most part to a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiments that this concept of the new</v>

1222
00:56:54.221 --> 00:56:55.660
<v Speaker 4>world of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

1223
00:56:55.661 --> 00:56:56.494
<v Speaker 4>of the American constitution is that one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the first documents I was translated </v>

1224
00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:00.454
<v Speaker 4>when I was in Iraq and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>suppress the flyers around was the bill </v>

1225
00:57:02.801 --> 00:57:06.190
<v Speaker 4>of rights of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me it's like my Bible is like one of</v>

1226
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:09.520
<v Speaker 4>the most important because during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time that it came from obviously,</v>

1227
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:11.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean now we take it for granted.</v>

1228
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:12.720
<v Speaker 4>People say like freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a human life.</v>

1229
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:13.583
<v Speaker 4>But before this concept of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of separation of powers and separation </v>

1230
00:57:17.051 --> 00:57:19.270
<v Speaker 4>of church and state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for me like the most important things</v>

1231
00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:20.104
<v Speaker 4>about the American constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are used to be radical ideas back </v>

1232
00:57:22.751 --> 00:57:26.410
<v Speaker 4>at the time and established this nation </v>
<v Speaker 4>of from people all over the world.</v>

1233
00:57:26.411 --> 00:57:28.060
<v Speaker 4>And here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this.</v>

1234
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:28.953
<v Speaker 4>This kind of happened in medical news </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the plant and the three of us </v>

1235
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.823
<v Speaker 4>from different parts of the wall to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a different culture or background can </v>

1236
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:37.810
<v Speaker 4>come together and have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>about ideas.</v>

1237
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.580
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the power of ideas.</v>

1238
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:40.414
<v Speaker 4>And I love that you brought up Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jefferson in this because about a year </v>

1239
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.130
<v Speaker 4>ago I was at cello,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was his home.</v>

1240
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:46.230
<v Speaker 4>He Got Regina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1241
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a great place and they tell his</v>

1242
00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:53.620
<v Speaker 4>story and it's really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>because progress takes time so that they</v>

1243
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:54.400
<v Speaker 4>taught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he looked.</v>

1244
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.800
<v Speaker 4>This is a man who owned slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only did he owned slaves,</v>

1245
00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 4>he had relations with at least one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think several of the women.</v>

1246
00:58:01.001 --> 00:58:03.760
<v Speaker 4>So he was in effect having sex with his </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaves.</v>

1247
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 4>So obviously something's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's not right on many in terms</v>

1248
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:10.330
<v Speaker 4>of slavery and women's rights and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>zillion reasons,</v>

1249
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:14.200
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time he was doing so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much good for the country and so many of</v>

1250
00:58:14.201 --> 00:58:15.034
<v Speaker 4>the ideas he had lead to goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it shows that not everything is </v>

1251
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:22.180
<v Speaker 4>through that kernel of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to find the goodness in people.</v>

1252
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but and,</v>

1253
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:24.274
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a trend nowadays to apply </v>

1254
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:27.053
<v Speaker 3>modern moral framework to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past and you're starting to see that </v>

1255
00:58:30.951 --> 00:58:34.700
<v Speaker 3>with Oxford Rhodes must fall campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>

1256
00:58:34.701 --> 00:58:37.460
<v Speaker 3>We're looking back into the past and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>faulting,</v>

1257
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:38.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leader,</v>

1258
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.370
<v Speaker 3>certainly in the history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1259
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:42.080
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for views they had.</v>

1260
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:42.890
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1261
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:43.723
<v Speaker 4>how dangerous do you think that is as </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's sort of in the academic </v>

1262
00:58:45.711 --> 00:58:46.080
<v Speaker 4>world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1263
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.020
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find that to be incredibly dangerous.</v>

1264
00:58:48.021 --> 00:58:50.960
<v Speaker 4>We're going to look back on everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>one day as,</v>

1265
00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:51.794
<v Speaker 4>as culture changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to look back on everybody </v>

1266
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.790
<v Speaker 4>and go APP that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well see he was a homophobe right?</v>

1267
00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:58.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although I think he actually said </v>

1268
00:58:59.451 --> 00:59:02.090
<v Speaker 4>something that I should be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>married or something to that effect.</v>

1269
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:04.190
<v Speaker 4>We will be able to do that to everybody.</v>

1270
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1271
00:59:04.771 --> 00:59:05.330
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1272
00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:07.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting on campus.</v>

1273
00:59:07.071 --> 00:59:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what Joel Wilson School,</v>

1274
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:13.670
<v Speaker 3>and I'm at a university there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're debating removing his name.</v>

1275
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question is again,</v>

1276
00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:20.720
<v Speaker 3>it ultimately comes down to why do you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like that helps,</v>

1277
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

1278
00:59:21.641 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 3>is it something that's a personal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't feel like a personal attack.</v>

1279
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if we,</v>

1280
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:32.170
<v Speaker 3>if we weigh out every single person with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of moral calculus,</v>

1281
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna you're really not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find any.</v>

1282
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1283
00:59:37.671 --> 00:59:39.300
<v Speaker 3>any ideal person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1284
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.971
<v Speaker 3>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1285
00:59:39.971 --> 00:59:40.020
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1286
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:40.853
<v Speaker 4>There's literally nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I keep saying the left </v>

1287
00:59:42.371 --> 00:59:44.860
<v Speaker 4>just eats itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen this over and over.</v>

1288
00:59:44.861 --> 00:59:45.720
<v Speaker 4>Unless your APP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1289
00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:47.950
<v Speaker 4>we can see the way sometimes even with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernie,</v>

1290
00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:48.784
<v Speaker 4>they've turned on Bernie a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>with some of the race issues with black </v>

1291
00:59:51.131 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 4>lives matter and it's like here's a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>who was arrested in the,</v>

1292
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:54.524
<v Speaker 4>in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're standing up against segregation </v>

1293
00:59:56.501 --> 00:59:57.334
<v Speaker 4>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you have to have a better </v>

1294
00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:02.320
<v Speaker 4>set of principles than something that'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>just come around and get you on day.</v>

1295
01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They also talk about history.</v>

1296
01:00:04.421 --> 01:00:07.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're also nice to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>context and the timing.</v>

1297
01:00:07.541 --> 01:00:08.374
<v Speaker 4>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Jefferson wanted slavery to be part </v>

1298
01:00:10.301 --> 01:00:11.134
<v Speaker 4>of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he will have written into the </v>

1299
01:00:11.801 --> 01:00:13.540
<v Speaker 4>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So obviously,</v>

1300
01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:14.374
<v Speaker 4>I mean the guy was sophisticated enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it takes time to understand what </v>

1301
01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:18.820
<v Speaker 4>diverse in.</v>

1302
01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.430
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to mind reading,</v>

1303
01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.380
<v Speaker 4>this seems like a pretty good over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1304
01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It also shows,</v>

1305
01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:25.204
<v Speaker 4>I guess that we have personal short </v>
<v Speaker 4>falls that you can somehow maybe in the </v>

1306
01:00:29.231 --> 01:00:31.270
<v Speaker 4>public be better than you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>personally.</v>

1307
01:00:31.271 --> 01:00:32.104
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's writing all of these things </v>

1308
01:00:33.461 --> 01:00:37.450
<v Speaker 4>about equality for man clearly led the </v>
<v Speaker 4>groundwork for you,</v>

1309
01:00:37.451 --> 01:00:38.410
<v Speaker 4>the slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1310
01:00:38.411 --> 01:00:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet at the same time,</v>

1311
01:00:39.911 --> 01:00:42.580
<v Speaker 4>at the personal level he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1312
01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.220
<v Speaker 4>certainly component.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about an hour,</v>

1313
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.560
<v Speaker 4>like bringing the conversation to </v>
<v Speaker 4>global.</v>

1314
01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.394
<v Speaker 4>Is that like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as I work in the human rights </v>

1315
01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:53.470
<v Speaker 4>field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would be honest like for starch</v>

1316
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.333
<v Speaker 4>in Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to advocate for same sex </v>

1317
01:00:55.661 --> 01:00:58.130
<v Speaker 4>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but our advocate,</v>

1318
01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:59.163
<v Speaker 4>the concept that gays are human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>equal equal rights and then you can </v>

1319
01:01:03.611 --> 01:01:06.250
<v Speaker 4>build a foundation that over time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1320
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.153
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw Mike based upon many of </v>

1321
01:01:08.681 --> 01:01:11.200
<v Speaker 4>Jefferson's readings and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and back to the eight,</v>

1322
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:14.660
<v Speaker 4>the life eating itself is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was this congressman,</v>

1323
01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.050
<v Speaker 4>he's also was a civil rights icon.</v>

1324
01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His last name is Louis.</v>

1325
01:01:18.821 --> 01:01:21.550
<v Speaker 4>I forgot who endorsed Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Lewis.</v>

1326
01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.480
<v Speaker 4>John Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1327
01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.500
<v Speaker 4>So I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1328
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cannot avoid this election shot.</v>

1329
01:01:26.171 --> 01:01:27.004
<v Speaker 4>I can bash any candidate I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what happened when he endorsed </v>

1330
01:01:30.461 --> 01:01:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if somebody I agree with or don't,</v>

1331
01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:33.723
<v Speaker 4>that's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The amount of attacks that he got from </v>

1332
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.740
<v Speaker 4>the far left was pretty impressive about</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they are anti racist.</v>

1333
01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:44.320
<v Speaker 4>They were calling him pretty racist </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms,</v>

1334
01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.513
<v Speaker 4>uncle Tom and word and overall all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because he endorsed a candidate </v>

1335
01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:50.524
<v Speaker 4>they didn't like this is itself the LF </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating itself because they supposedly </v>

1336
01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:54.863
<v Speaker 4>and direct service,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is still on their side of the </v>

1337
01:01:56.651 --> 01:01:57.484
<v Speaker 4>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:00.070
<v Speaker 4>There was a quote from Fdr that I really</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1339
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:00.993
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He asked him why do you support the </v>

1340
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:03.760
<v Speaker 4>fascist in Nicaragua?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1341
01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:06.170
<v Speaker 4>they said he's a son of a bitch but is </v>
<v Speaker 4>our self.</v>

1342
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:07.840
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if,</v>

1343
01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:08.800
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1344
01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.633
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr Lewis and drove the car day like </v>

1345
01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.420
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is okay.</v>

1346
01:02:13.421 --> 01:02:15.650
<v Speaker 4>That is what that black person should </v>
<v Speaker 4>vote for.</v>

1347
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.650
<v Speaker 4>But if not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then he is thing to talk about.</v>

1348
01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:20.320
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1349
01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.153
<v Speaker 4>they claim to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there is a new term called the </v>

1350
01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:25.190
<v Speaker 4>entire racists racists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is interesting.</v>

1351
01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:27.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have double negative but,</v>

1352
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 4>and also have to work this through at </v>
<v Speaker 4>home.</v>

1353
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.873
<v Speaker 4>And also there's the Islamophobia phobia</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the fear of being perceived as </v>

1354
01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Islamophobic is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is now selected.</v>

1355
01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.330
<v Speaker 4>They are afraid of being perceived as </v>
<v Speaker 4>level four,</v>

1356
01:02:39.331 --> 01:02:41.920
<v Speaker 4>a big advocate for as low phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1357
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 4>there's no doubt that that was all </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1358
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:45.540
<v Speaker 4>We have to wrap up here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to give you the last word.</v>

1359
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.813
<v Speaker 4>What can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the number one thing we can do </v>

1360
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.480
<v Speaker 4>to help these ideas spread?</v>

1361
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 3>So what Phase I was saying about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outreach he wishes to divert the,</v>

1362
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.690
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1363
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:57.523
<v Speaker 3>the outrage manufactured by all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>small little incursions into global </v>

1364
01:03:01.431 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1365
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.433
<v Speaker 3>I think that's actually something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's working on on movements and it's a </v>

1366
01:03:06.711 --> 01:03:07.544
<v Speaker 3>very worthwhile cause because with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can engage people who do live in </v>

1367
01:03:11.301 --> 01:03:12.134
<v Speaker 3>western democracies to be more active </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to be more aware of the perspective </v>

1368
01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:19.790
<v Speaker 3>of what's going on with the persecution </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going on in closed societies.</v>

1369
01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:23.480
<v Speaker 3>So that's for me very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very key thing.</v>

1370
01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And while we have our power of freedom,</v>

1371
01:03:25.941 --> 01:03:27.200
<v Speaker 4>we may as well use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1372
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:28.243
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I have a feeling we're going to </v>

1373
01:03:29.001 --> 01:03:30.830
<v Speaker 4>continue this in the green room because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we barely.</v>

1374
01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.540
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even pick this thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1375
01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:33.573
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well for more of the work that Faisal </v>

1376
01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:35.894
