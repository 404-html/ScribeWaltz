00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.473
<v Speaker 1>  </v>

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.150
<v Speaker 2>They say history repeats itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer in this theory,</v>

3
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:08.984
<v Speaker 2>which is why I try to spend more time on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show talking about big ideas and </v>

4
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 2>political philosophies rather than day </v>
<v Speaker 2>to day political rumblings.</v>

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.693
<v Speaker 2>Most of our political debates and media </v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage has devolved into catchy </v>

6
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:20.744
<v Speaker 2>soundbites and zingers usually stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>around some sort of publicity stunt </v>

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.093
<v Speaker 2>instead of true substantive debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even protesting these days seems to be </v>

8
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 2>more about screaming and hashtagging </v>
<v Speaker 2>then making a coherent argument.</v>

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.093
<v Speaker 2>Just think back to the election itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the candidates in the media spend </v>

10
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 2>more time on the issues or more time on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the circus?</v>

11
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.603
<v Speaker 2>I think the answer is pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Understanding political philosophies </v>

12
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:44.624
<v Speaker 2>helps to guide us through the endless </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise that comes out of our political </v>

13
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:48.194
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I've tried to talk about </v>

14
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:50.414
<v Speaker 2>issues like gay marriage in a context </v>
<v Speaker 2>which shows you can be liberal and for </v>

15
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:57.260
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage because you want gay people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be treated equally under the law.</v>

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.333
<v Speaker 2>Or you can be libertarian in for gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage because you don't want the </v>

17
00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 2>government involved in a contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>between two consenting adults.</v>

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.713
<v Speaker 2>If you understand the philosophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings of liberalism and </v>

19
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this case,</v>

20
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.353
<v Speaker 2>it can bring you to the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion without understanding </v>

21
00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 2>political philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts on any day to day issue,</v>

22
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:18.674
<v Speaker 2>we'll be guided more by your feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then by fax we see plenty of feelings </v>

23
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 2>over facts in our public discourse these</v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

24
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 2>and it's partly why we're so divided as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a nation.</v>

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.933
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't to say that feelings don't </v>

26
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 2>matter at all because we are humans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they do,</v>

27
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 2>but the way we're governed has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on what is empirically true,</v>

28
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.863
<v Speaker 2>not just what makes us feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beyond just knowing political </v>

29
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:42.464
<v Speaker 2>philosophies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing history is an incredibly </v>

30
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:48.110
<v Speaker 2>important part of having a well rounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how the world works.</v>

31
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.243
<v Speaker 2>Think of how many people you talk to who</v>
<v Speaker 2>claim to know everything about what tax </v>

32
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:53.054
<v Speaker 2>system is right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what foreign policy is best next </v>

33
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask them something like,</v>

34
00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:57.914
<v Speaker 2>so tell me the reasons that the flat tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrong or remind me of the history of </v>

35
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During the Ottoman Empire.</v>

36
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.723
<v Speaker 2>Everyone on television seems to have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to pretend they know everything </v>

37
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.044
<v Speaker 2>about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the very people you have to </v>

38
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 2>watch out for the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If history does repeat itself,</v>

39
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure what it's repeating</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and no,</v>

40
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:19.124
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're repeating Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany even though it's very trendy to </v>

41
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:22.634
<v Speaker 2>say that these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we truly are at a unique crossroads in </v>

42
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.120
<v Speaker 2>American politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I can't directly compare it</v>

43
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.133
<v Speaker 2>to any other time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that America has two </v>

44
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 2>diametrically opposed political parties </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are caught between the left and the</v>

45
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:37.274
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

46
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Now with Donald Trump in the White </v>
<v Speaker 2>House,</v>

47
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:39.884
<v Speaker 2>we have a presidential wildcard who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned political alignments on their </v>

48
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>

49
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:45.644
<v Speaker 2>Democrats are now suddenly suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguing for states' rights because they </v>

50
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 2>don't like all the federal power trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>has with his series of executive orders.</v>

51
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 2>This political chaos is also pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive amounts of people,</v>

52
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>sick of the extremes on both sides into </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a morphis middle.</v>

53
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 2>There doesn't seem to be a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader for this new center,</v>

54
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 2>nor anyone in the mainstream talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it yet,</v>

55
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 2>but mark my words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's here.</v>

56
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.013
<v Speaker 2>The key to this new center is success </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be who sees it first and who turns </v>

57
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.304
<v Speaker 2>it into a political movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether that means a new party or </v>

58
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>reforming one of the two existing major </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties or something else all together.</v>

59
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>While that remains to be seen on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this new political alignment,</v>

60
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>we also have access to information like </v>
<v Speaker 2>never before.</v>

61
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>As I talk about all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all walk around with the world in our</v>

62
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.234
<v Speaker 2>pockets right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can connect with someone across the </v>

63
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 2>globe just as easily as with someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the street.</v>

64
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.433
<v Speaker 2>The genius empower of the Internet's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to change our physical world </v>

65
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.694
<v Speaker 2>cannot be overstated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This connectivity has started </v>

66
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.784
<v Speaker 2>revolutions in the Middle East and shine</v>
<v Speaker 2>light on the inner workings of our </v>

67
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 2>government via Wiki leaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

68
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 2>so much of the information is not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise alone,</v>

69
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.404
<v Speaker 2>but noise intended to deflect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confused and upset you made by people </v>

70
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>who want to profit off you or outright </v>
<v Speaker 2>control you.</v>

71
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.013
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if our mainstream media had done their </v>

72
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:10.264
<v Speaker 2>job for the past eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to be the guardian of truth in </v>

73
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 2>our society than maybe the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet wouldn't be so vital to our</v>

74
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 2>functioning democracy in 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

75
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>cable and network news dropped the ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>at almost every corner and here we are.</v>

76
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 2>They cozy to the power instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping it in check,</v>

77
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.794
<v Speaker 2>they colluded with the people they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to keep watch over and they </v>

78
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 2>partied with the very politicians that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were supposed to be reporting on.</v>

79
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.133
<v Speaker 2>Now suddenly the mainstream media is </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get its Mojo back by being </v>

80
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.124
<v Speaker 2>hard on trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would argue that it's basically </v>

81
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 2>too late to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

82
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of sad seeing them flail </v>
<v Speaker 2>around knowing that less and less people</v>

83
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:50.104
<v Speaker 2>are paying attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even right now there's talk that they </v>

84
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 2>are going to cancel the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>correspondence dinner because so many in</v>

85
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:56.944
<v Speaker 2>the media dislike trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think how actually insane that is when </v>

86
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:00.574
<v Speaker 2>they like the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can party with them and drank with </v>

87
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that they don't,</v>

88
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.893
<v Speaker 2>well the Jig is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we needed them to guard the guy </v>

89
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>they liked as much as the guy that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like.</v>

90
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.193
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we more and more catered the news to </v>

91
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't listen to pundits.</v>

92
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:16.864
<v Speaker 2>We don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We impugn the motives of anyone we </v>

93
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:19.654
<v Speaker 2>disagree with and we block friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>family who dare have different opinions </v>

94
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:23.314
<v Speaker 2>than us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this is exactly why we need to </v>

95
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:29.080
<v Speaker 2>know history and philosophy more now </v>
<v Speaker 2>than ever.</v>

96
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 2>We need to understand where we came from</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can know where we're going.</v>

97
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>We need to know why the founding fathers</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote the constitution the way they did.</v>

98
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.193
<v Speaker 2>We need to understand why they yearn for</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and liberty in a way that seems </v>

99
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:42.634
<v Speaker 2>almost archaic to us now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's possibly the most important </v>

100
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>lesson we could learn this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With all this in mind,</v>

101
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of a better guest for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>week as we continue our partnership with</v>

102
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 2>the fine folks over at learn liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Carlin is a radio and TV personality</v>

103
00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>who hosts two incredibly successful</v>

104
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 3>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>common sense and hardcore history.</v>

105
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.263
<v Speaker 3>As a self described political Martian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan uses thought experiments to try to </v>

106
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 3>make some sense of the modern world on </v>
<v Speaker 3>his podcast.</v>

107
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hosts long,</v>

108
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 3>well thought out presentations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical events set to the backdrop of</v>

109
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:16.514
<v Speaker 3>how we might view these events through a</v>
<v Speaker 3>current day lens while he is in </v>

110
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:20.474
<v Speaker 3>technically a historian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's proven himself to be incredibly </v>

111
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:24.254
<v Speaker 3>adept at storytelling history in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that offers some modern day answers to </v>

112
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 3>historical events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If history repeats itself,</v>

113
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.323
<v Speaker 3>then let's make the next repeat a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>more enlightened and perhaps a little </v>

114
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 3>less painful than the last time around.</v>

115
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

116
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 3>We're continuing our partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn liberty this week.</v>

117
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:50.911
<v Speaker 3>And joining me is a TV and radio </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalist host of two hugely successful</v>

118
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:54.220
<v Speaker 3>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>common sense and hardcore history,</v>

119
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.270
<v Speaker 3>and a self-described political Martian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan Carlin,</v>

120
00:06:58.271 --> 00:06:59.104
<v Speaker 3>welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for having me on political </v>

121
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 3>Martian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this phrase.</v>

122
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.963
<v Speaker 3>I understand why you use this phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but tell the people who don't know what </v>

123
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:10.270
<v Speaker 3>a political Martian is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

124
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.523
<v Speaker 3>It came from not being able to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good easy description when people ask </v>

125
00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:15.754
<v Speaker 3>you your political views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really jealous of the people that </v>

126
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:19.210
<v Speaker 3>can throw a word out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody goes,</v>

127
00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:20.350
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get where you're from.</v>

128
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.800
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't have anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I tried to figure out how you,</v>

129
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.873
<v Speaker 3>in a very nice short way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>describe that you're kind of off the </v>

130
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:28.450
<v Speaker 3>map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was what I came up with.</v>

131
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Just this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

132
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm from Mars as far as you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned.</v>

133
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because no word,</v>

134
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to sit there and go,</v>

135
00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:35.470
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit this.</v>

136
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:36.304
<v Speaker 3>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to give them sort of a </v>

137
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:37.624
<v Speaker 3>political recipe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30% this 20% and just political marsh </v>

138
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 3>and ends up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can nod their head and say,</v>

139
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:43.450
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

140
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:44.284
<v Speaker 3>You're off the grid somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of it is also that you're </v>

141
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:50.980
<v Speaker 3>actively trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out things still,</v>

142
00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:52.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we have this thing in America where</v>

143
00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:53.434
<v Speaker 3>everyone seems to believe or want </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone else to believe that they know </v>

144
00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:59.890
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't come from that position.</v>

145
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.933
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a combination of that and </v>

146
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.030
<v Speaker 3>believing that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not,</v>

147
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

148
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not insulting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope people who have ideologies,</v>

149
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.613
<v Speaker 3>but this idea that you could have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>template that works all the time is </v>

150
00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:13.804
<v Speaker 3>something that just doesn't appeal to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think you have to be able to </v>

151
00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.350
<v Speaker 3>pivot based on circumstances.</v>

152
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.530
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to admit that something's not working.</v>

153
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:22.780
<v Speaker 3>But if that conflicts with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>

154
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.793
<v Speaker 3>how do you reconcile those things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to learn based on </v>

155
00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:26.764
<v Speaker 3>what you're actually seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like there's not a whole lot </v>

156
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:31.000
<v Speaker 3>of flexibility sometimes in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies.</v>

157
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What percentage of people do you think </v>

158
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:36.340
<v Speaker 3>actually understand political ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 3>in general?</v>

159
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:38.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was sort of talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the top of the show,</v>

160
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.693
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like people don't really </v>

161
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 3>understand what really is the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between a liberal and a progressive or a</v>

162
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:47.860
<v Speaker 3>libertarian and a conservative of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

163
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:48.694
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think most people even that talk </v>

164
00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:50.764
<v Speaker 3>about politics professionally actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand sort of the philosophic </v>

165
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 3>underpinnings of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

166
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.353
<v Speaker 3>the easy answer to that is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the second answer is partly because </v>

167
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 3>those words have all changed in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning.</v>

168
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>

169
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take liberal as a perfect example.</v>

170
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm a liberal.</v>

171
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.303
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most people in this country who </v>

172
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:10.704
<v Speaker 3>favor a democratic form of government </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on freedom and rights and civic </v>

173
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.294
<v Speaker 3>action and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're all liberals in the grand </v>

174
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 3>scheme of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

175
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to kind of sit down with people</v>

176
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:21.384
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dive deeply into what they believe </v>

177
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.560
<v Speaker 3>to try to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

178
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 3>where they stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

179
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.333
<v Speaker 3>but on the spectrum of governments all </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world throughout all time </v>

180
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 3>periods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all liberals.</v>

181
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.051
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

182
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 3>So we're just arguing over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

183
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 3>what percentage of this or that you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

184
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.180
<v Speaker 3>you want to put it into the category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so by,</v>

185
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 3>by not knowing what the words really </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean or by conflating what they meet are</v>

186
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 3>changing what they mean.</v>

187
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.013
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason people use </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive is because liberals been so </v>

188
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 3>changed in terms of its meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any of these terms,</v>

189
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 3>what does conservative mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm fiscally conservative.</v>

190
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>

191
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 3>That as I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I've done this show,</v>

192
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 3>at least in this current incarnation for</v>
<v Speaker 3>last two years,</v>

193
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.553
<v Speaker 3>I realized I use these labels cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you need them to frame </v>

194
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.410
<v Speaker 3>conversations and yet the more we use </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

195
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 3>the more meaningless they become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is a straight,</v>

196
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm a political Martian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

197
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.623
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you sit down and try to </v>

198
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 3>figure out when you're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

199
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.553
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you stand on this issue or </v>

200
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.014
<v Speaker 3>where you stand on that issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like we're all a mix and </v>

201
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 3>that if you think you're really up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the line,</v>

202
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 3>give me a little time and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll figure out.</v>

203
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.800
<v Speaker 3>I always say we're all radical on </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

204
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll find some subject where,</v>

205
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you said that you felt that way about</v>

206
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 3>it and gave no sort of clarifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>remark,</v>

207
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:34.280
<v Speaker 3>people would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

208
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that describes all of us.</v>

209
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I think we feel like we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

210
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.763
<v Speaker 3>I remember learning about totems and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like psychology one oh one and I think </v>

211
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 3>that's what a lot of people do where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they sit there and say,</v>

212
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:45.474
<v Speaker 3>part of my self image is that I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative or that I'm a liberal and </v>

213
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:49.764
<v Speaker 3>that locks you in to things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to be able to say that I base my </v>

214
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 3>opinion on my own views and that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to fit into any particular box,</v>

215
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 3>I find that completely liberating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

216
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 3>people will say that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>inconsistent.</v>

217
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 3>That's what the author,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

218
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 3>you're really not going to say you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a consistent philosophy.</v>

219
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to have a consistent philosophy.</v>

220
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Why should we treat a political </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy like a religion?</v>

221
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.490
<v Speaker 3>That's actually the reverse of how we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should treat it.</v>

222
00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:16.280
<v Speaker 3>And yet they seem to want this purity </v>
<v Speaker 3>test online.</v>

223
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that line and I think it was,</v>

224
00:11:18.601 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was it,</v>

225
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 3>who said it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it may have been,</v>

226
00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:21.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

227
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keynes who said,</v>

228
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somebody accused him of flip </v>

229
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:26.130
<v Speaker 3>flopping essentially we would call it </v>
<v Speaker 3>flip flopping good.</v>

230
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.960
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the facts change,</v>

231
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I change my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

232
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's Kinda how I feel.</v>

233
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:32.994
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not going to get locked into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that I tend to be in my own life </v>

234
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:36.684
<v Speaker 3>certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I'm a fiscal conservative for </v>

235
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I am,</v>

236
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 3>and you find out that for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular cause you need to spend a lot</v>

237
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 3>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I determine the cause is worth it,</v>

238
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to spend a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean I'm a flip flopper right.</v>

239
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 3>So I mean in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm more of a pragmatist but,</v>

240
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>but even a pragmatist can be utopian</v>

241
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 4>in ways you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

242
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 4>I want to base things on what's likely </v>
<v Speaker 4>to work.</v>

243
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 4>At the same time I want to shoot for </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than we have now.</v>

244
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Does that make you a pragmatic utopia?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anest I mean,</v>

245
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 4>do those work and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and once you start to mix those phrases,</v>

246
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 4>do they mean anything anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a liberal conservative.</v>

247
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:11.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a conservative liberal.</v>

248
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm a pragmatic utopia and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are these ones?</v>

249
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.630
<v Speaker 4>A lot of stuff I like premeditated </v>
<v Speaker 4>spontaneity.</v>

250
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:17.111
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

251
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 4>at what point does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it not make any sense anymore?</v>

252
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How frustrating to some of that get for </v>

253
00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:22.734
<v Speaker 2>you as someone that tries to bring some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these ideas up that you have to talk </v>

254
00:12:26.401 --> 00:12:30.210
<v Speaker 2>about things sort of in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes can be a little,</v>

255
00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:30.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

256
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.070
<v Speaker 2>confusing even for you.</v>

257
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.710
<v Speaker 4>What's frustrating and traditional media</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they demanded that I do that,</v>

258
00:12:36.711 --> 00:12:39.020
<v Speaker 4>which is why it was no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was always fighting with people,</v>

259
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

260
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.750
<v Speaker 4>in the world that we're in now and new </v>
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>

261
00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:43.550
<v Speaker 4>It's not frustrating at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can be anywhere I want,</v>

262
00:12:43.551 --> 00:12:46.400
<v Speaker 4>which is why I'm a political Martian and</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one says anything.</v>

263
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.510
<v Speaker 4>They're fine with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

264
00:12:47.511 --> 00:12:48.344
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me that's a sign of the changing </v>

265
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.773
<v Speaker 4>maybe a state of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although it also might be a sign that I </v>

266
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:53.564
<v Speaker 4>don't have a lot of liberal or </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative listener could be one or </v>

267
00:12:55.821 --> 00:12:56.654
<v Speaker 4>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of political martians </v>

268
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.560
<v Speaker 4>listening.</v>

269
00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably a little bit,</v>

270
00:12:59.241 --> 00:13:00.110
<v Speaker 2>a little bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

271
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.203
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me a little bit about your time in </v>

272
00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:08.450
<v Speaker 2>the more mainstream media and what led </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to say,</v>

273
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go off the range here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if I can figure this out on my own,</v>

274
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.320
<v Speaker 2>which you've obviously been very sick.</v>

275
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 4>I never wanted to do though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

276
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

277
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:15.221
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

278
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 4>working here in town at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the ABC station and,</v>

279
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was working on the assignment desk and</v>

280
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:20.770
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

281
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 4>I was about 23 and I thought I had it </v>
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>

282
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:24.004
<v Speaker 4>I thought this was really good and these</v>
<v Speaker 4>reporters would come in who were only a </v>

283
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:27.214
<v Speaker 4>little bit older than I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what are you doing to get Outta </v>

284
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.531
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

285
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 4>not that I'm loving this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is great.</v>

286
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:31.511
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

287
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 4>you'll die here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

288
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:34.390
<v Speaker 4>you'll be doing this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

289
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 4>and so to sort of assuage them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

290
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 4>I sent out tapes to be a reporter and no</v>
<v Speaker 4>one was getting hired.</v>

291
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't think there was any real </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger.</v>

292
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 4>And then I got hired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

293
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.780
<v Speaker 4>I became a television reporter and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>as life has it,</v>

294
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities intervene.</v>

295
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:48.903
<v Speaker 4>And then someone gave me a talk radio </v>
<v Speaker 4>show job and I was doing three hours a </v>

296
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five days a week.</v>

297
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 4>And that's where I think things really </v>
<v Speaker 4>started to grow and change because,</v>

298
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:58.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

299
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.781
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always,</v>

300
00:13:58.781 --> 00:13:59.614
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always feel bad for the people that </v>

301
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:01.264
<v Speaker 4>are getting started today because I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>to make all my egregious mistakes and </v>

302
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:06.760
<v Speaker 4>how all that stuff go out into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ether.</v>

303
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:07.594
<v Speaker 4>It'd be gone if I started today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those would all be some youtube video </v>

304
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:11.374
<v Speaker 4>all put together and they'd see every </v>
<v Speaker 4>gaf and horrible thing I ever said or </v>

305
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>

306
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shouldn't be understated.</v>

307
00:14:16.191 --> 00:14:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're saying right there,</v>

308
00:14:17.331 --> 00:14:20.000
<v Speaker 2>because I think that's a huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mentioned that I had Dennis prager</v>

309
00:14:20.001 --> 00:14:22.130
<v Speaker 2>on a few weeks ago and I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:22.964
<v Speaker 2>now that you're in the digital world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come from traditional media and </v>

311
00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:25.964
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how conscious are you of being </v>

312
00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:28.994
<v Speaker 2>afraid of saying something that can just</v>
<v Speaker 2>be selectively edited or clipped in a </v>

313
00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:35.540
<v Speaker 2>way that's going to make you seem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

314
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.374
<v Speaker 2>the reverse thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just be relentlessly attacked </v>

315
00:14:38.121 --> 00:14:38.954
<v Speaker 2>for that and the fact that you were able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the breeding ground before it </v>

316
00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:43.730
<v Speaker 2>was fully on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

317
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:44.570
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

318
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I guess the infinity grid of existing </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever</v>

319
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 4>sweet digital stone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little stone as as there is</v>

320
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things will be out there now.</v>

321
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Now that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that I've got most,</v>

322
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 3>I hope of the egregious mistakes out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>

323
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's digital stuff.</v>

324
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I liked the idea that it's never </v>

325
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.360
<v Speaker 3>going away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

326
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.203
<v Speaker 3>but the kids coming up today who have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make all their mistakes and have it be </v>

327
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.090
<v Speaker 3>forever available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

328
00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:13.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm sympathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I didn't exist in that air.</v>

329
00:15:13.051 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I was able to get all of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense out of the way,</v>

330
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before it was forever.</v>

331
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:19.670
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in terms of my career,</v>

332
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.250
<v Speaker 3>that's how you learn and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

333
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.163
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then also the political Martian </v>

334
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:25.784
<v Speaker 3>thing works itself out that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because in talk radio when I was there </v>

335
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:29.414
<v Speaker 3>as I think it still is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really a conservative medium and </v>

336
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have a conservative guy then </v>

337
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 3>you'd have me and then you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 3>another conservative guy.</v>

338
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.273
<v Speaker 3>And I was the one who was continually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was at odds with the audience </v>

339
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.483
<v Speaker 3>all the time and I was about 26 and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average age of talk radio was about 35 </v>

340
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.860
<v Speaker 3>to 45.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

341
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

342
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.203
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

343
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 3>it was a baptism by fire that looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>back on it now was really good for me at</v>

344
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:54.050
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really hard.</v>

345
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:55.850
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how life is for everybody.</v>

346
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

347
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're working your career out,</v>

348
00:15:58.011 --> 00:15:58.844
<v Speaker 3>you have these ages where you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling your hair out sometimes and now </v>

349
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 3>you look back on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a wonderful learning experience</v>

350
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 3>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing the future,</v>

351
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.983
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

352
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:08.883
<v Speaker 3>as I think especially for guys in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties when you really are in a place </v>

353
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 3>where you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

354
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.913
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your self image is so wrapped up in how </v>

355
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Speaker 3>you and gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was such a hard time period and now I</v>

356
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:22.190
<v Speaker 3>look back on it and think though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't go through that,</v>

357
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 3>you're not where you are now.</v>

358
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.770
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

359
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you give your kids advice as a </v>

360
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:27.494
<v Speaker 3>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a lot of that I'm </v>

361
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 3>going to throw at them and hope it </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticks.</v>

362
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Of course they are going to have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>digital,</v>

363
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.193
<v Speaker 3>what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The digital stone and digital stone </v>

364
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:36.524
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their stuff's going to all be etched in </v>

365
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Speaker 3>digital and they also talk to the hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to hear anything dad has</v>

366
00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:43.094
<v Speaker 3>to say anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not sure you can teach your kids </v>

367
00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:46.010
<v Speaker 3>a lot sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious,</v>

368
00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:46.844
<v Speaker 3>so you're the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were the sort of liberal or marsh </v>

369
00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:52.310
<v Speaker 3>and marsh and even around a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative radio.</v>

370
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:53.144
<v Speaker 3>What do you think it is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives that it's only </v>

371
00:16:56.061 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 3>conservative that listened to radio?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically?</v>

372
00:16:57.921 --> 00:16:58.754
<v Speaker 3>I mean we know that liberal channels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Air America and any of the progressive </v>

373
00:17:01.081 --> 00:17:01.851
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

374
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:02.684
<v Speaker 3>I guess some of it exists here or there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it pretty much always fails or </v>

375
00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:06.380
<v Speaker 3>nobody listens.</v>

376
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Is there something about conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and talk,</v>

377
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 3>do you think it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And first of all,</v>

378
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:11.744
<v Speaker 3>I always had a libertarian bent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which allowed me a place where there </v>

379
00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 3>could be a meeting of the minds between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the audience.</v>

380
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.860
<v Speaker 3>If you talk about freedom and liberty </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the constitution,</v>

381
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 3>which I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

382
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.523
<v Speaker 3>there was a place where we could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>some commonalities and then work around </v>

383
00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:25.260
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

384
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.093
<v Speaker 3>in terms of liberal is because I believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>in things like social programs and </v>

385
00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.190
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there were areas where,</v>

386
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 3>where we could have a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little friendly competition,</v>

387
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:34.814
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were meeting of the minds </v>

388
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 3>areas in terms of why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

389
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rush limbaugh,</v>

390
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.283
<v Speaker 3>he always likes to say that there will </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a wing of the talk radio history </v>

391
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 3>library and he's right and he will own </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

392
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 3>But by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by changing the landscape,</v>

393
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't speak for other mediums.</v>

394
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 4>I can definitely talk about radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not extremely inventive and they're</v>

395
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 4>not extremely chance takers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know they do.</v>

396
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.470
<v Speaker 4>And so when you see something works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think limbaugh actually said this,</v>

397
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 4>he said for years they told me it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like someone else and not to do this.</v>

398
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:05.094
<v Speaker 4>And then the minute he makes it then </v>
<v Speaker 4>that then they just want you to be like </v>

399
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:08.784
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was partly my problem too </v>

400
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:11.544
<v Speaker 4>when I would go in there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you want me to be like all these </v>

401
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:14.634
<v Speaker 4>other people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would say because that's what </v>

402
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at what's working everywhere.</v>

403
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:18.144
<v Speaker 4>So I think there's this attitude that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess what I'm saying is if a liberal </v>

404
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:25.950
<v Speaker 4>talk show host made it big somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you would see everybody's saying,</v>

405
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 4>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is working in Boston.</v>

406
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.223
<v Speaker 4>You should train of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think there's a tendency to follow </v>

407
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:31.104
<v Speaker 4>the leader in that business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think he started off the trend </v>

408
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.183
<v Speaker 4>after the fairness doctrine ended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then if you go listen to talk radio </v>

409
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 4>before limbo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a completely different animal.</v>

410
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean I remember listening to it as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid and it's,</v>

411
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't bear any resemblance to what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have today.</v>

412
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.663
<v Speaker 4>So once you see that working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that becomes the template and if you </v>

413
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 4>want to be big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to do it that way.</v>

414
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:49.944
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I had such a hard time for</v>
<v Speaker 4>12 years in the medium because I wasn't </v>

415
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:56.340
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember a guy by the name of Bob</v>

416
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Grant?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You sure big.</v>

417
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.500
<v Speaker 4>I remember being in the car with my mom </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was 1213 something like that.</v>

418
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.190
<v Speaker 4>My mom hated this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did not ever agree with him on anything.</v>

419
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.293
<v Speaker 4>His callers would call in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would just scream at them and then </v>

420
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:09.450
<v Speaker 4>they'd hang up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

421
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.270
<v Speaker 4>it was just chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking at the time,</v>

422
00:19:12.271 --> 00:19:13.104
<v Speaker 4>who could listen to this kind of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet he was one of the biggest guys </v>

423
00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.930
<v Speaker 4>are done that to a guy named Joe Pine </v>
<v Speaker 4>who was the original,</v>

424
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 4>and there was a lot of imitators,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Joe Pine was,</v>

425
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:22.471
<v Speaker 4>I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

426
00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 4>you go back to like 1970 and pine </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually had a TV show too.</v>

427
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:28.440
<v Speaker 4>And it was the first one where you would</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

428
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.020
<v Speaker 4>cause before that it was like the Dick </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cabinets and everybody you know,</v>

429
00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:31.854
<v Speaker 4>and the William f Buckley's and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>were cigarettes and black and white and </v>

430
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:37.710
<v Speaker 4>high minded and Joe Pine would just say </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a communist and you yell at him.</v>

431
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.540
<v Speaker 4>And you know what's funny is is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when these are novelties,</v>

432
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.830
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it becomes the norm it,</v>

433
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was,</v>

434
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:49.910
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to somebody the other day </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were talking about what I heard a</v>

435
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.690
<v Speaker 4>right wing talk show hosts say the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

436
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.733
<v Speaker 4>And I know he doesn't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's got to differentiate himself </v>

437
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 4>from the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

438
00:19:57.961 --> 00:20:01.560
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about a riot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Berkeley and it was who could be the</v>

439
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:02.394
<v Speaker 4>hardest on the rioters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this guy said they got to be taken </v>

440
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:05.244
<v Speaker 4>out by the police,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put in a back room and euthanize like </v>

441
00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:08.430
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you go,</v>

442
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would he say that?</v>

443
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:10.674
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says that because he's got to </v>

444
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 4>differentiate himself from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>

445
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:13.794
<v Speaker 4>Who said the toughest thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this guy is going to go vacation </v>

446
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 4>at his house in the hamptons after he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said this.</v>

447
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.133
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's ginned up the anger level in the </v>

448
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:22.344
<v Speaker 4>country so much more now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's not a lot of individual </v>

449
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:27.990
<v Speaker 4>responsibility because no individual is </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible for all of that.</v>

450
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.213
<v Speaker 4>But collectively it's creating a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where there's no </v>

451
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 4>countervailing forces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

452
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:34.860
<v Speaker 4>if you're ginning up the anger on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>

453
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.560
<v Speaker 4>what's reducing the anger on that side?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

454
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 4>what's helping us achieve some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>status?</v>

455
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

456
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.263
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the answer might be maybe if I </v>

457
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:44.574
<v Speaker 4>could be so bold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be a little bit of people like </v>

458
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that like us who</v>

459
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.020
<v Speaker 3>are a little out of the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

460
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:53.380
<v Speaker 3>We're out of the mainstream system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're trying to find some answers.</v>

461
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:54.214
<v Speaker 3>So you get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flame thrower saying crazy things </v>

462
00:20:56.261 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

463
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the protesters myself,</v>

464
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 3>but I'm certainly not for euthanizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

465
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 3>but that people like us who actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to explore some of these ideas are</v>

466
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:07.820
<v Speaker 3>maybe the counter balance now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get some of that exists.</v>

467
00:21:07.821 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Same people are listening know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's an inherent problem I guess.</v>

468
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:13.240
<v Speaker 3>But I think we're getting some of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

469
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 3>because we know this because the cable </v>
<v Speaker 3>news and mainstream news,</v>

470
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 3>their numbers keep going down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>digital stuff keeps rising.</v>

471
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:21.430
<v Speaker 3>So we must be shifting some of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people over.</v>

472
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:22.264
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could suggest that maybe it's a genre </v>

473
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 3>playing itself out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

474
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.140
<v Speaker 3>that's the other problem is that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>death throws me.</v>

475
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:28.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what happens is naturally </v>

476
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:32.890
<v Speaker 3>you take it more and more extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

477
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Because when you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

478
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.893
<v Speaker 3>it's a little like a drug situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you need more and more to get the </v>

479
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:38.434
<v Speaker 3>same effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at a certain point you overdose and </v>

480
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

481
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.153
<v Speaker 3>No matter how strong you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think when you're talking about </v>

482
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:48.910
<v Speaker 3>euthanizing protesters in the back room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not much further you can go.</v>

483
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.773
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe what happens at that point </v>

484
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Speaker 3>is the genre and the medium and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>style plays out and it's cyclical.</v>

485
00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could say that again,</v>

486
00:21:58.991 --> 00:21:59.824
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cutting off your heroin supply for </v>

487
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:02.290
<v Speaker 3>a while and going back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

488
00:22:02.291 --> 00:22:03.124
<v Speaker 3>it may come back another round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure what these people can </v>

489
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:06.724
<v Speaker 3>do to continually gin up the level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>anger so that those people are still </v>

490
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 3>getting something out of the program.</v>

491
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.293
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find this in my own political show </v>

492
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 3>where after a while you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least I think it's getting repetitive</v>

493
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.180
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

494
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.043
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've already said everything that </v>

495
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:22.750
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not willing to say stuff,</v>

496
00:22:22.751 --> 00:22:23.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not willing to,</v>

497
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 3>to take it to the next level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep the heroin hit,</v>

498
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>affecting you the way you want it to.</v>

499
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at what point do you say,</v>

500
00:22:29.831 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've said everything I can say.</v>

501
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you either take this or leave it,</v>

502
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:35.230
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to continue to hammer </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point home.</v>

503
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:36.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do something else.</v>

504
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure everyone has that freedom.</v>

505
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:39.484
<v Speaker 3>And I know that those people are being </v>
<v Speaker 3>told by consultants on these talk </v>

506
00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:44.320
<v Speaker 3>stations more heavier heat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heat,</v>

507
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:45.610
<v Speaker 3>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

508
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 3>so what do you do in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in those moments where you felt,</v>

509
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 3>I've said this already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

510
00:22:50.051 --> 00:22:50.884
<v Speaker 3>I've made this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this for a couple </v>

511
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.870
<v Speaker 3>months or maybe a couple of years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to shift.</v>

512
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.950
<v Speaker 3>How do you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you tell your audience or,</v>

513
00:22:57.951 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

514
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going.</v>

515
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.903
<v Speaker 3>I've always been very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been very open with them about my </v>

516
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:03.724
<v Speaker 3>struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but partly is you try to find different </v>

517
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:06.184
<v Speaker 3>ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look at the point from different </v>

518
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.091
<v Speaker 3>angles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

519
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 3>that's what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

520
00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:13.690
<v Speaker 3>media with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with radio especially,</v>

521
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:16.300
<v Speaker 3>they used to say that because people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in and out of their cars,</v>

522
00:23:16.301 --> 00:23:17.320
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

523
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.070
<v Speaker 3>You can't go any deeper than 15 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise,</v>

524
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't assume that people are </v>

525
00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:24.280
<v Speaker 3>following you through this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast.</v>

526
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to say they have to know where</v>

527
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:29.740
<v Speaker 3>you stand on every single issue within </v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes to turning on the radio.</v>

528
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.080
<v Speaker 3>That's a cartoon character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cartoon.</v>

529
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.850
<v Speaker 3>So I said to them that that's not going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen.</v>

530
00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Now on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my program and on your program,</v>

531
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.293
<v Speaker 3>you can show shades of gray and nuance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially because that's actually </v>

532
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:41.884
<v Speaker 3>novel now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that might play out the same way </v>

533
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:45.380
<v Speaker 3>that the right wing stuff is playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

534
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

535
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.023
<v Speaker 4>the novelty of being able to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything is a little bit more complex </v>

536
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:50.774
<v Speaker 4>than you make it out to be is great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've done more than 300 comments on </v>

537
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:54.794
<v Speaker 4>shows and I start running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not creative enough to continually </v>

538
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:00.710
<v Speaker 4>come out with new ways to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least not to my satisfaction.</v>

539
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:03.260
<v Speaker 4>The audience says they still want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hear more of this stuff,</v>

540
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not sure I want to give it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

541
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 4>That to me seems too much like what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>got away from.</v>

542
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.673
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

543
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:10.783
<v Speaker 2>this is the true artists struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you think about it in </v>

544
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:13.934
<v Speaker 2>those terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really this is the struggle of an </v>

545
00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:15.764
<v Speaker 2>artist to create something successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then still feel enough inner power </v>

546
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 2>to continue and not pander and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new and all that.</v>

547
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.003
<v Speaker 4>It shows you really thought about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it's exactly right and it's </v>

548
00:24:26.621 --> 00:24:28.780
<v Speaker 4>something that I didn't get initially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to,</v>

549
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I had to learn it by slowly but surely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

550
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.020
<v Speaker 4>getting used to the idea that anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing is art is weird because you</v>

551
00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:40.430
<v Speaker 4>can't call yourself an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Artist is something that the,</v>

552
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:44.230
<v Speaker 4>that the other people have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And first of all,</v>

553
00:24:44.231 --> 00:24:46.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that anything that we do </v>
<v Speaker 4>politically is I,</v>

554
00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.620
<v Speaker 4>and that's part of the problem because </v>
<v Speaker 4>now the other podcast that I'm doing has</v>

555
00:24:50.621 --> 00:24:53.450
<v Speaker 4>evolved into something that is a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit like art anyway.</v>

556
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:54.783
<v Speaker 4>And it's so satisfying to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something where you stand back and you </v>

557
00:24:58.091 --> 00:24:58.924
<v Speaker 4>look at it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like my grandchildren to hear that </v>

558
00:25:01.241 --> 00:25:02.074
<v Speaker 4>because if I die before they meet me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll get a chance to know me through </v>

559
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:07.030
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

560
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.310
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the more I listened to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>political stuff,</v>

561
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.200
<v Speaker 4>even my own stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

562
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.060
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see any art and it,</v>

563
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.190
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and once you've done some painting,</v>

564
00:25:15.191 --> 00:25:16.024
<v Speaker 4>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of going and doing my pool </v>

565
00:25:18.671 --> 00:25:20.050
<v Speaker 4>cleaning job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just not as,</v>

566
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.090
<v Speaker 4>as not as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

567
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:25.180
<v Speaker 4>satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at a certain point I'm tired of it.</v>

568
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.083
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we live in a country that's a </v>

569
00:25:28.331 --> 00:25:31.750
<v Speaker 4>representative democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which requires us to be engaged.</v>

570
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

571
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.980
<v Speaker 4>because of what you do are hyper </v>
<v Speaker 4>engaged.</v>

572
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:37.023
<v Speaker 4>I'm hyper engaged at a certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is why I didn't do 12 straight </v>

573
00:25:40.091 --> 00:25:41.650
<v Speaker 4>years of talk radio because you burn </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

574
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.070
<v Speaker 4>And especially in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you and I talked about this earlier,</v>

575
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.143
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a guy who feels like I rubbed the </v>

576
00:25:47.861 --> 00:25:50.140
<v Speaker 4>magic lamp and the genie came out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

577
00:25:50.141 --> 00:25:51.220
<v Speaker 4>you have a wish.</v>

578
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:51.851
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

579
00:25:51.851 --> 00:25:54.700
<v Speaker 4>I want a political outsider because </v>
<v Speaker 4>these politicians are killing us.</v>

580
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.560
<v Speaker 4>And he gave me Donald Trump and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>

581
00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:57.963
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really should have had a lawyer with </v>

582
00:25:59.231 --> 00:26:02.110
<v Speaker 4>me to decide exactly how I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>phrase that wish.</v>

583
00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.773
<v Speaker 4>And but what that does in my particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>case is I'm not sure what to do anymore </v>

584
00:26:07.601 --> 00:26:12.130
<v Speaker 4>because I got what I asked for four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing this 24 25 years.</v>

585
00:26:12.131 --> 00:26:12.964
<v Speaker 4>If you had my radio thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never thought I'd get a political </v>

586
00:26:14.891 --> 00:26:17.500
<v Speaker 4>outsider.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I have one and look what I got.</v>

587
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.130
<v Speaker 4>So what do I tell my odd against now </v>
<v Speaker 4>where do I go from here?</v>

588
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.990
<v Speaker 2>For the few of us that publicly or in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar space,</v>

589
00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel that very intimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you're talking about.</v>

590
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.213
<v Speaker 2>I've spent a lot of time in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>year or two talking about what I think </v>

591
00:26:30.471 --> 00:26:31.304
<v Speaker 2>is wrong with the left because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal and I want the left to be </v>

592
00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>liberal again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now we have trump,</v>

593
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:38.600
<v Speaker 2>which brings this whole other set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

594
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people say to me,</v>

595
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:41.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not attacking him enough.</v>

596
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

597
00:26:42.471 --> 00:26:43.304
<v Speaker 2>we now have this x factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is kind of upside down right </v>

598
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

599
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's incumbent on people like us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pave the way for other people because</v>

600
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:52.291
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're waiting.</v>

601
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:53.124
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

602
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

603
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.780
<v Speaker 4>let's get to trump for a second because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because to me,</v>

604
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:00.210
<v Speaker 4>you had started out with talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideologies.</v>

605
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.990
<v Speaker 4>This is a different thing entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

606
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:04.824
<v Speaker 4>I always say if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could have had a crystal ball </v>

607
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:07.164
<v Speaker 4>during the campaign and you could've </v>
<v Speaker 4>shown who the nominees for various </v>

608
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.413
<v Speaker 4>official positions would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump doesn't get elected no matter who </v>

609
00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:16.050
<v Speaker 4>you runs against.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

610
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:16.884
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think he gets elected if </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's running against even Joe Biden who </v>

611
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:19.910
<v Speaker 4>I consider to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

612
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 4>kind of a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Biden runs away with it.</v>

613
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.543
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a manifestation of our </v>

614
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 4>dissatisfaction with the political </v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

615
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Speaker 4>which we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

616
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anybody who satisfied with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

617
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.820
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

618
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.383
<v Speaker 4>and at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not necessarily going to take us </v>

619
00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:37.224
<v Speaker 4>away from our problems because our </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems are too much power in the </v>

620
00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:41.004
<v Speaker 4>presidency.</v>

621
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Not Enough attention paid to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>constitution.</v>

622
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.503
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that we've gotten away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the various things that make America </v>

623
00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:48.144
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is things like the separation of </v>

624
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 4>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>checks and balances,</v>

625
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.440
<v Speaker 4>but the tendency of Americans is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>blame things on,</v>

626
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:58.550
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last administration or something we,</v>

627
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:02.430
<v Speaker 4>this is 50 years of trends building on </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of trends.</v>

628
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.410
<v Speaker 4>This is not a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

629
00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.293
<v Speaker 4>and every president in my lifetime has </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken us farther down the road to what </v>

630
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.760
<v Speaker 4>presidential historian slash singer </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the imperial presidency.</v>

631
00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:13.680
<v Speaker 4>Well now it's the hyper imperial </v>
<v Speaker 4>presidency.</v>

632
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.680
<v Speaker 4>We have a congress that reminds you of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Roman Senate.</v>

633
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.120
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the end where,</v>

634
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:18.931
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

635
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:19.764
<v Speaker 4>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the real skill level that you </v>

636
00:28:21.811 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 4>possess as a senator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fun raising,</v>

637
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lawrence Lessig,</v>

638
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:26.050
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

639
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.350
<v Speaker 4>Harvard law professor had said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

640
00:28:28.351 --> 00:28:29.184
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he diagrammed how you work your way up </v>

641
00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 4>through the political system now.</v>

642
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.473
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing they asked you when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to be a small town mayor </v>

643
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 4>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but have a little d or a little lower by</v>

644
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:40.500
<v Speaker 4>your name is how good are you worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>fund raising.</v>

645
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.353
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So by the time you actually achieve a </v>

646
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:45.690
<v Speaker 4>higher office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the number one qualification?</v>

647
00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:47.210
<v Speaker 4>They were looking for the whole way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

648
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 4>but you were a good legislator that none</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those things.</v>

649
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.620
<v Speaker 4>So these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a grandmother who was this amazing</v>

650
00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:54.490
<v Speaker 4>fundraiser and she would raise funds for</v>
<v Speaker 4>charities.</v>

651
00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:57.540
<v Speaker 4>She would go to these events and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what these people are good at.</v>

652
00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.393
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it should surprise us very little </v>

653
00:28:59.731 --> 00:29:01.230
<v Speaker 4>when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

654
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 4>we need a check and balance here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're not there.</v>

655
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:04.883
<v Speaker 4>They're only there now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There'll be there if they're </v>

656
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.480
<v Speaker 4>contributors want them to be there or if</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can make political hay.</v>

657
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.190
<v Speaker 4>But in terms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you watch,</v>

658
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 4>you watch the Republicans now in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Congress and it's,</v>

659
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.353
<v Speaker 4>if it wasn't so serious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fun to watch because people are </v>

660
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 4>some of the most astute hedgers you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever seen in your life,</v>

661
00:29:22.201 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 4>but they don't know how to hedge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now on this one,</v>

662
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 4>they're sitting there at a fork in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road going,</v>

663
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Speaker 4>do I cast my lot with the trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration is going to be a big star</v>

664
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:32.940
<v Speaker 4>in a hero in 10 years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In which case I turned the right turn at</v>

665
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:33.774
<v Speaker 4>Albuquerque and it worked out right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or is he going to be seen as a disaster </v>

666
00:29:36.521 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 4>when anyone who was aligned with him is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

667
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.710
<v Speaker 4>a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do I need to take,</v>

668
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 4>they don't know what to do and all they</v>

669
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.933
<v Speaker 3>want to do is figure out the way where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to turn out the best so </v>

670
00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 3>that I get reelected or whatever down </v>
<v Speaker 3>the road.</v>

671
00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:48.724
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these people are so concerned </v>

672
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:53.260
<v Speaker 3>about a job that they should only do </v>
<v Speaker 3>temporarily anyway,</v>

673
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.950
<v Speaker 3>that it's warped their entire ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have anything connected to what we would</v>

674
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 3>call leadership today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

675
00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.833
<v Speaker 3>you've hit on so many things that I talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about all the time on the show about </v>

676
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:05.190
<v Speaker 3>separation of powers and an imperialist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

677
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

678
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:06.603
<v Speaker 3>and why we should be governed by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution and not just by the whims </v>

679
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.343
<v Speaker 3>of current events and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the imperial presidency I think is a </v>

680
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:16.720
<v Speaker 3>really interesting thing because I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been on the record for years that when,</v>

681
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:17.470
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

682
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.303
<v Speaker 3>George W.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush was doing all the executive </v>

683
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:20.374
<v Speaker 3>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was against them when Obama was doing </v>

684
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:22.690
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was against them.</v>

685
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:23.703
<v Speaker 3>I'm against them now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we have a guy who's obviously </v>

686
00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 3>willing to govern fully by an </v>
<v Speaker 3>authoritarian who's willing to govern by</v>

687
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

688
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not only his fault,</v>

689
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 3>it's not his fault for grabbing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>power that has anybody who was going to,</v>

690
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 3>to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody was going to do it,</v>

691
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 3>somebody who was going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that the best argument for limited</v>

692
00:30:41.021 --> 00:30:41.854
<v Speaker 3>government then that forget what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics are on specific issues that </v>

693
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.713
<v Speaker 3>these people that want money and want </v>
<v Speaker 3>reelections and that are okay to be </v>

694
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.143
<v Speaker 3>authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only fight against them is to reign </v>

695
00:30:53.231 --> 00:30:54.064
<v Speaker 3>in the power they have over us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about that for me because </v>

696
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:57.360
<v Speaker 3>that's another one of those terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

697
00:30:57.361 --> 00:30:58.194
<v Speaker 3>just like we were talking about at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of liberal and conservative </v>

698
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.990
<v Speaker 3>molly's things that are hard to define a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real meaning.</v>

699
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:02.824
<v Speaker 3>What does limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has a limited government in the </v>

700
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:07.150
<v Speaker 3>world find what country in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>has?</v>

701
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a functioning country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a limited government who has that?</v>

702
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:11.883
<v Speaker 3>Because the truth is is we have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>country here that has 300 million </v>

703
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:18.160
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a budget that is enormous.</v>

704
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.220
<v Speaker 3>We have needs that are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

705
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:22.743
<v Speaker 3>how could you have a limited government?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well limited I would argue limited </v>

706
00:31:25.151 --> 00:31:25.984
<v Speaker 3>meaning that it should just do less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should have a little less control </v>

707
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:30.154
<v Speaker 3>over us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that it should take less from </v>

708
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:33.580
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So lower taxes as a general thing.</v>

709
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.980
<v Speaker 3>We could probably scale back the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military a little bit.</v>

710
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.023
<v Speaker 3>We could probably scale back some social</v>
<v Speaker 3>services and they might be taken over a </v>

711
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 3>little more by private enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sort of thing.</v>

712
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that we should dismantle </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government and not,</v>

713
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a driver's license on.</v>

714
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you end up,</v>

715
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.133
<v Speaker 3>if you take away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go and you started to remove </v>

716
00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:53.680
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would find out,</v>

717
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:54.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a belief.</v>

718
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.860
<v Speaker 3>So cause we don't do this so it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>theoretical,</v>

719
00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:57.723
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the belief is is that if you took </v>

720
00:31:59.981 --> 00:32:00.814
<v Speaker 3>away this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would find out why it appeared in </v>

721
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:03.994
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now does that mean it's going to come </v>

722
00:32:05.831 --> 00:32:06.664
<v Speaker 3>back in a form that's as bloated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we all understand that the </v>

723
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:12.700
<v Speaker 3>government has built in budgetary </v>
<v Speaker 3>increases every year,</v>

724
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.560
<v Speaker 3>which is again you would say part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

725
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:17.320
<v Speaker 3>This is where a zero balance budgeting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff comes into play.</v>

726
00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.800
<v Speaker 3>The real wake up call for Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

727
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.190
<v Speaker 3>and it's funny because if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could do anything,</v>

728
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:25.024
<v Speaker 3>if you were to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to cut the defense budget by </v>

729
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:27.544
<v Speaker 3>two thirds and I'm going to give every </v>
<v Speaker 3>American a travel budget where they can </v>

730
00:32:30.491 --> 00:32:34.000
<v Speaker 3>go around the world and begin to see how</v>
<v Speaker 3>other countries work.</v>

731
00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Because the biggest nightmare for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans in terms of upsetting all your</v>

732
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:41.210
<v Speaker 3>beliefs is to go to some of these other </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be shocked that it works.</v>

733
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean go to Scandinavia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavian would not work here because</v>

734
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 3>the entire system is dependent upon you </v>
<v Speaker 3>being Scandinavia.</v>

735
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.270
<v Speaker 3>It's basically a homogeneous and I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

736
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 3>I had a scandinavian girlfriend and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>

737
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:53.774
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were getting on the freeway here in </v>

738
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles and as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting on the freeway in Los Angeles is</v>

739
00:32:57.441 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 3>a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

740
00:32:58.551 --> 00:32:59.384
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

741
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 3>and she looked at me and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what's wrong with America.</v>

742
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 3>She goes in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be left hand,</v>

743
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 3>would go right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go,</v>

744
00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 3>left hand will go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

745
00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:07.460
<v Speaker 3>that's what's wrong with you people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

746
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 3>that's why you can't compete like we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we fight for everything.</v>

747
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.603
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even getting on the freeway is a </v>

748
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 3>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you go there,</v>

749
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:15.763
<v Speaker 3>what's shocking to an American is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a system that would not work </v>

750
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it works there.</v>

751
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.750
<v Speaker 3>And they don't tell you when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up.</v>

752
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.561
<v Speaker 3>These things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

753
00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:22.394
<v Speaker 3>you have to actually see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what that means is you come back </v>

754
00:33:24.771 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 3>here and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

755
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.870
<v Speaker 3>government is not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're kind of taught.</v>

756
00:33:29.871 --> 00:33:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the government is necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>inefficient and,</v>

757
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.420
<v Speaker 3>and can't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always say that that's a defeatist</v>

758
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 3>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

759
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.950
<v Speaker 3>back when the Clinton Gore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

760
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.890
<v Speaker 3>White House was brand new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a program that they called,</v>

761
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:43.724
<v Speaker 3>had a great name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great market look at reinventing </v>

762
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:45.764
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea was that this is not </v>

763
00:33:47.961 --> 00:33:50.120
<v Speaker 3>necessarily the way government has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

764
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could we improve it?</v>

765
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:52.754
<v Speaker 3>Could we make it better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm always suggesting is we really </v>

766
00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:58.190
<v Speaker 3>haven't tried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and remember it's a big bureaucracy.</v>

767
00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Even if you decide you want to go in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>change it,</v>

768
00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:01.041
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

769
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:01.874
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're going to find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>with trump is he gonna find out pretty </v>

770
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:07.460
<v Speaker 3>darn soon that the bureaucracy has a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ability to push back,</v>

771
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

772
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:08.563
<v Speaker 3>So when I talk limited government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it's about dismantling some of </v>

773
00:34:10.701 --> 00:34:11.534
<v Speaker 3>that bureaucracy so that potentially we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could maybe get to some of that Clinton </v>

774
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:17.210
<v Speaker 3>and Gore stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me when I look at the system,</v>

775
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.673
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that we could do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would affect the lives of average </v>

776
00:34:21.591 --> 00:34:22.424
<v Speaker 3>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the least in terms of cutting big </v>

777
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:26.900
<v Speaker 3>government is changed the foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy.</v>

778
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Because when you look at discretionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending,</v>

779
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:31.840
<v Speaker 3>and as we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of the things like Medicare,</v>

780
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.290
<v Speaker 3>that's not discretion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social security,</v>

781
00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:36.080
<v Speaker 3>those are not discretionary spending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The military though is,</v>

782
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.273
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and remember that if you go actually </v>

783
00:34:38.361 --> 00:34:41.510
<v Speaker 3>look at a 1960 budget for the u s </v>
<v Speaker 3>military and a budget,</v>

784
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:45.680
<v Speaker 3>now it's totally apples and oranges </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the way they did deliberately</v>

785
00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:48.050
<v Speaker 3>hidden things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the 1960 budget for example,</v>

786
00:34:48.051 --> 00:34:50.990
<v Speaker 3>the veteran's affairs costs are all </v>
<v Speaker 3>built into the defense budget.</v>

787
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a separate part of the budget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you'll hear somebody say,</v>

788
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't spend that much on defense now.</v>

789
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.840
<v Speaker 3>Well deliberately apples and oranges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like so much of the budget.</v>

790
00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with unemployment numbers.</v>

791
00:35:01.071 --> 00:35:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't compare the,</v>

792
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 3>the ones in the old days to now cause we</v>
<v Speaker 3>exclude people that haven't been looking</v>

793
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:06.510
<v Speaker 3>for work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

794
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:07.071
<v Speaker 3>First.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

795
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:12.071
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at the amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>we spend and you say that's free money,</v>

796
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 3>that's money you could allocate </v>
<v Speaker 3>elsewhere,</v>

797
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.853
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you talk about cutting </v>

798
00:35:16.551 --> 00:35:19.130
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would happen if you cut the defense</v>

799
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 3>budget in half?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're still the largest military</v>

800
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:25.310
<v Speaker 3>spending country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

801
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:26.144
<v Speaker 3>I should point out that we have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>department of defense and yet Americans </v>

802
00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 3>have not fought on American soil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother is 80 years old.</v>

803
00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 3>She was to the last time Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought on American soil.</v>

804
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.070
<v Speaker 3>What does that money buying us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you talk about well-spent funds,</v>

805
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 3>is there a lot of waste and fraud in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Medicare?</v>

806
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 3>You darn right there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but through the government pipeline,</v>

807
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.653
<v Speaker 3>people are being helped on the other end</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's being helped by the defense </v>

808
00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 3>budget?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

809
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I bring this up,</v>

810
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:57.564
<v Speaker 3>I'm called an isolationist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a term that goes back to the </v>

811
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:02.400
<v Speaker 3>1940 [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has all sorts of baggage on purpose.</v>

812
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.303
<v Speaker 3>All I want is a government with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy like every other </v>

813
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:10.434
<v Speaker 3>government in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can that by definition be </v>

814
00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:14.034
<v Speaker 3>isolationists?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many basis outside of Russia does </v>

815
00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:17.064
<v Speaker 3>Russia have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably the next most </v>

816
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:20.070
<v Speaker 3>interventions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can count them on one hand.</v>

817
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.083
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have in excess of 125 maybe he used </v>

818
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 3>to be 180.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

819
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.160
<v Speaker 3>and you pay for that does a taxpayer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

820
00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.520
<v Speaker 3>What do you get for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll,</v>

821
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 3>is this where trump actually made </v>
<v Speaker 3>headway with things?</v>

822
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Because he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

823
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:33.564
<v Speaker 3>why do we have bases in Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She should be enough for forgetting the </v>

824
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:38.550
<v Speaker 3>moral center that we may not be sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

825
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:39.384
<v Speaker 3>But if you're just the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he basically made the argument </v>

826
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:44.910
<v Speaker 3>you're making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is Japan paying us to protect them?</v>

827
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 3>So he's making the sort of same argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're laying out there,</v>

828
00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:48.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

829
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not as both thought out but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

830
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:51.864
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason he made it though is the </v>

831
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:53.874
<v Speaker 3>reason that every president you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of makes the argument and that is </v>

832
00:36:57.751 --> 00:36:58.584
<v Speaker 3>that the United States public has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>and always is accepted the most extreme </v>

833
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 3>situations of a mind that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want that.</v>

834
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you go look at how this started</v>

835
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:08.694
<v Speaker 3>between 1945 and 1952 is when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country made a huge change in foreign </v>

836
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:15.130
<v Speaker 3>policy and we've never looked back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They knew you could read the,</v>

837
00:37:15.131 --> 00:37:15.964
<v Speaker 3>the Truman administration and the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they knew that the people didn't </v>

838
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:20.430
<v Speaker 3>want this because it's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

839
00:37:20.431 --> 00:37:21.840
<v Speaker 3>why am I spending money for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

840
00:37:21.841 --> 00:37:23.230
<v Speaker 3>or the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

841
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.293
<v Speaker 3>that's why George W.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush ran for a more humble foreign </v>

842
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:27.084
<v Speaker 3>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why President Woodrow Wilson and </v>

843
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Franklin Roosevelt both won elections </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they took us into world.</v>

844
00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.960
<v Speaker 3>War is on promises to keep you out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>world wars.</v>

845
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.680
<v Speaker 3>There's no precedent that runs for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States top job and says,</v>

846
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.663
<v Speaker 3>if you elect me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be in more foreign </v>

847
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen because the electorate</v>

848
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet that's what we get.</v>

849
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that say then?</v>

850
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Obama ran the first time,</v>

851
00:37:48.211 --> 00:37:51.420
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons he beat Hillary in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the primary was because he was harder on</v>

852
00:37:51.421 --> 00:37:52.254
<v Speaker 3>getting out of Iraq immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the reasons he was able </v>

853
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Speaker 3>to get through the primary to beat her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet at the same time,</v>

854
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:57.953
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the only president we've </v>

855
00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:02.550
<v Speaker 3>ever had that his entire eight years we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were at war,</v>

856
00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:05.970
<v Speaker 3>we've been in Afghanistan for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire ears were still there.</v>

857
00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:06.900
<v Speaker 3>We don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

858
00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:08.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone has any clue why </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're there anymore.</v>

859
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.440
<v Speaker 3>I think you need you to find war because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say,</v>

860
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:13.283
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we've not been at war </v>
<v Speaker 3>since 1947 probably since the Truman </v>

861
00:38:19.621 --> 00:38:20.790
<v Speaker 3>doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

862
00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:22.770
<v Speaker 3>but it depends on what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

863
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.233
<v Speaker 3>is it war if your funding war somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>else or is it only wore if your people </v>

864
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:31.560
<v Speaker 3>are actually fighting and dying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we've been funding war,</v>

865
00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

866
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.170
<v Speaker 3>and understand there's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationale.</v>

867
00:38:34.171 --> 00:38:36.600
<v Speaker 3>It's called military that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

868
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.500
<v Speaker 3>and you can go back and read the </v>
<v Speaker 3>documents at the time.</v>

869
00:38:38.501 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 3>They're very open about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

870
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:41.643
<v Speaker 3>we have the Great Depression and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried all kinds of things to get us out </v>

871
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were still in it.</v>

872
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.923
<v Speaker 3>When the gin up 1942 the second world </v>
<v Speaker 3>war started and you go look at the </v>

873
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 3>production numbers and economic numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the graph is almost straight up,</v>

874
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then in 1943 when it's clear that the</v>

875
00:38:57.461 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 3>war will be over in a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and attorney it,</v>

876
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:00.930
<v Speaker 3>it's like an arm wrestling match and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

877
00:39:00.931 --> 00:39:02.800
<v Speaker 3>it's too far ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start thinking,</v>

878
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:03.634
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what happens when we turn off the </v>

879
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:05.524
<v Speaker 3>spigot?</v>

880
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I had a,</v>

881
00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 3>a great uncle who had a small little </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubber plant in,</v>

882
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 3>in Orange County before the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the war started,</v>

883
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 3>the government gave him a huge amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>money to buy up all the land.</v>

884
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:18.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need all the,</v>

885
00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it,</v>

886
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after the war,</v>

887
00:39:21.071 --> 00:39:22.570
<v Speaker 3>they simply said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do whatever you want with it.</v>

888
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.820
<v Speaker 3>So he sold it and made a fortune just on</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling the land.</v>

889
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.920
<v Speaker 3>But that's the Spigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

890
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:27.754
<v Speaker 3>That's the tech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was this feeling that we could </v>

891
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:32.890
<v Speaker 3>go right back to the great depression if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't keep the spigot on right.</v>

892
00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:33.724
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this unnatural amount of cash coming </v>

893
00:39:35.471 --> 00:39:39.760
<v Speaker 3>from taxpayers to military to build </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that we might not even need,</v>

894
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 3>but it keeps jobs going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

895
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.234
<v Speaker 3>If I told you that we could get out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these countries in the world would </v>

896
00:39:45.641 --> 00:39:46.180
<v Speaker 3>be fine.</v>

897
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.470
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds great,</v>

898
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.860
<v Speaker 3>but if I said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we could also lose 250,000</v>

899
00:39:50.861 --> 00:39:53.720
<v Speaker 3>jobs to people in the defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it then when you'd have to say it right,</v>

900
00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.990
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then one must ask,</v>

901
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 3>are these real jobs or these jobs where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

902
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:00.514
<v Speaker 3>Dave Rubin's tax dollars basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>transferred to a guy who works in the </v>

903
00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:04.024
<v Speaker 3>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

904
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 3>and is that really capitalism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know we,</v>

905
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:07.804
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go after the socialist countries for </v>

906
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:11.590
<v Speaker 3>being socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How different is it?</v>

907
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Military keynesianism is a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialist,</v>

908
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:14.743
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just transferring it in a </v>

909
00:40:15.491 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 3>different and then when we don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff,</v>

910
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.251
<v Speaker 3>this is where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

911
00:40:18.251 --> 00:40:21.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a bit of a shell game because if we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were really concerned with defense,</v>

912
00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.640
<v Speaker 3>you would not give your best equipment </v>
<v Speaker 3>to other people.</v>

913
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.713
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would not say this is our new m one </v>

914
00:40:27.251 --> 00:40:28.084
<v Speaker 3>Abrams tank and we have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when you give it to other </v>

915
00:40:29.711 --> 00:40:30.670
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

916
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.680
<v Speaker 3>That means they have the same stuff you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

917
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:33.514
<v Speaker 3>which means you've got to go build </v>
<v Speaker 3>better stuff so it becomes a make work </v>

918
00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:38.194
<v Speaker 3>program if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how much of it is just that that </v>

919
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:41.344
<v Speaker 3>maybe this thing has grown so big?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about budgets and military </v>

920
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:45.904
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That t reigning it back in would almost </v>

921
00:40:49.631 --> 00:40:52.630
<v Speaker 3>be impossible short of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely radical.</v>

922
00:40:52.631 --> 00:40:53.464
<v Speaker 3>Like I would probably be four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to think it out a little bit </v>

923
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:57.220
<v Speaker 3>further and sit down with some economist</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

924
00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.143
<v Speaker 3>I would probably be for like a 20% cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the entire board for the </v>

925
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:02.464
<v Speaker 3>government just to just cut every </v>
<v Speaker 3>department back 20% mostly because of </v>

926
00:41:06.011 --> 00:41:06.844
<v Speaker 3>the bloat and the bureaucracy because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you could easily get 20% out of </v>

927
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:10.504
<v Speaker 3>almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do you think it's possible that </v>

928
00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:12.634
<v Speaker 3>we've maybe gotten too big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somehow turning it back could have </v>

929
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.520
<v Speaker 3>repercussions that we can't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine?</v>

930
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.181
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

931
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:22.210
<v Speaker 3>start with when you have a corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>political system,</v>

932
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 3>take for example the question of tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just brought up tanks.</v>

933
00:41:25.421 --> 00:41:26.254
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a famous story happened on all </v>

934
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:27.743
<v Speaker 3>six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year ago where it was a bit of a </v>

935
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:32.090
<v Speaker 3>scandal because the government doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want any more time.</v>

936
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Military did not want any more tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have lots of them,</v>

937
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.833
<v Speaker 3>but they build tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It important districts that have </v>

938
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:39.540
<v Speaker 3>senators who then go and argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

939
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.380
<v Speaker 4>you would decimate my local economy if </v>
<v Speaker 4>we weren't building.</v>

940
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.333
<v Speaker 4>So they're building more tanks than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>military says they want because we have </v>

941
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 4>to keep the work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See the military also smart,</v>

942
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 4>they locate a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I love the u s military by the way,</v>

943
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm a military history guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

944
00:41:52.881 --> 00:41:53.714
<v Speaker 4>but they locate the various important </v>
<v Speaker 4>facilities in places where there are </v>

945
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:00.740
<v Speaker 4>powerful politicians and what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have a real reason.</v>

946
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you talk about cutting </v>
<v Speaker 4>defense,</v>

947
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:03.290
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

948
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:04.183
<v Speaker 4>congressmen down in southern California </v>
<v Speaker 4>who have marine bases that depend on </v>

949
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:08.834
<v Speaker 4>that money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that feed families that go into the </v>

950
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:12.170
<v Speaker 4>local economies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

951
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:14.780
<v Speaker 4>do you have a Defense Department for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

952
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and and if you got rid of that,</v>

953
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.430
<v Speaker 4>does that mean you will suffer or does </v>
<v Speaker 4>that mean,</v>

954
00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:19.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

955
00:42:19.781 --> 00:42:21.620
<v Speaker 4>the true believers in capitalism would </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

956
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will reallocate all that,</v>

957
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you believe that,</v>

958
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:26.420
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm more of a pragmatist,</v>

959
00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:27.540
<v Speaker 4>it's an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

960
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.920
<v Speaker 4>but those funds will be relocated to </v>
<v Speaker 4>more productive measures will be form of</v>

961
00:42:30.921 --> 00:42:32.450
<v Speaker 4>creative destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you will.</v>

962
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>

963
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a more logical question.</v>

964
00:42:36.321 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Like if you talk about cutting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>defense budget for example,</v>

965
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 4>by 20%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with that is you haven't cut</v>

966
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:42.524
<v Speaker 4>the mission.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your job is to be the global </v>

967
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 4>policeman of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not spending enough now.</v>

968
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.930
<v Speaker 4>So you have to match the funding.</v>

969
00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would argue that's a problem too,</v>

970
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.560
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to match the funding</v>

971
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:54.720
<v Speaker 4>to the mission,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

972
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.330
<v Speaker 4>If our job is to defend the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States of America,</v>

973
00:42:57.331 --> 00:42:59.940
<v Speaker 4>we are wildly spending too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

974
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

975
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.920
<v Speaker 4>so here's the thing that never gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>debated.</v>

976
00:43:02.921 --> 00:43:03.310
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

977
00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:05.760
<v Speaker 4>it's like the dog that didn't bark and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sherlock Holmes,</v>

978
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:06.603
<v Speaker 4>the subject we never debate is allowing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the American people a voice in the </v>

979
00:43:09.871 --> 00:43:10.704
<v Speaker 4>foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if the American people are </v>

980
00:43:12.451 --> 00:43:13.284
<v Speaker 4>allowed to decide the foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have this foreign policy and </v>

981
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.733
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we don't have a voice in </v>

982
00:43:19.291 --> 00:43:20.730
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's why we have,</v>

983
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:21.840
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's the one thing,</v>

984
00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:22.674
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to say one thing about </v>

985
00:43:23.281 --> 00:43:24.114
<v Speaker 4>president trump?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably kept more campaign </v>

986
00:43:25.321 --> 00:43:26.154
<v Speaker 4>promises that any president I can think </v>
<v Speaker 4>of whether you want those promises are </v>

987
00:43:28.891 --> 00:43:29.724
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the one he's pivoting on is the </v>

988
00:43:31.351 --> 00:43:32.550
<v Speaker 4>foreign policy promise.</v>

989
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.810
<v Speaker 3>So the former policy problem is </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically people thought he was going to</v>

990
00:43:35.811 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 3>be more of an isolationist and now don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>use that term.</v>

991
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.080
<v Speaker 3>That's a slur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're playing right into it.</v>

992
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Well that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was not,</v>

993
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 3>he didn't run on war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's put it that way.</v>

994
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.113
<v Speaker 3>He said we're wasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of mine are more like other </v>

995
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:50.850
<v Speaker 3>countries for empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

996
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Which I guess in the American or hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>intervention,</v>

997
00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:54.500
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the American Lens,</v>

998
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:56.240
<v Speaker 3>it comes out as if you're in isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

999
00:43:56.241 --> 00:44:01.070
<v Speaker 3>but just take care of the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>interventionists country anymore.</v>

1000
00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 3>But you suspect that he's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting on that.</v>

1001
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:04.603
<v Speaker 3>The powers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's doing it because he </v>

1002
00:44:06.861 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 3>lied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you get in there and you don't,</v>

1003
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.110
<v Speaker 3>the inertia that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1004
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:11.770
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1005
00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:13.160
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets on you.</v>

1006
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:14.151
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1007
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 3>the Russian thing is fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1008
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:20.831
<v Speaker 3>because there's no reason for us to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>at odds with Russia.</v>

1009
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 3>And they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely agree.</v>

1010
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1011
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.620
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're going to depend,</v>

1012
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.650
<v Speaker 3>these leaders now have to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad guy.</v>

1013
00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:28.533
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean you get into a </v>

1014
00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>nuclear war</v>

1015
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.960
<v Speaker 4>over some miscalculation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1016
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.840
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have international competitors,</v>

1017
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.250
<v Speaker 4>but that's light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if your job is as our military,</v>

1018
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:41.851
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1019
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1020
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1021
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.030
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to explain this.</v>

1022
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 4>We have a policy and they updated all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>

1023
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.980
<v Speaker 4>a giant sort of global policy on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1024
00:44:48.981 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 4>on our plans for the next 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years.</v>

1025
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.043
<v Speaker 4>And our main goal these policies say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to have no international military </v>

1026
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:57.540
<v Speaker 4>competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None.</v>

1027
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 4>If that's your foreign policy goals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are leading to confrontation.</v>

1028
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:03.083
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that ends in confrontation and it </v>

1029
00:45:03.961 --> 00:45:04.794
<v Speaker 4>requires an enormous amount of spending </v>
<v Speaker 4>because our old goal used to be to be </v>

1030
00:45:07.981 --> 00:45:12.090
<v Speaker 4>able to fight two wars on opposite sides</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the planet at the same time.</v>

1031
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 4>Who else has a cost?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the argument,</v>

1032
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I read Charles Krauthammer who I dislike</v>
<v Speaker 4>intensely,</v>

1033
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other day and he said,</v>

1034
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:25.200
<v Speaker 4>what makes America great is global </v>
<v Speaker 4>leadership.</v>

1035
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.183
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess we weren't great before 1945 </v>

1036
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.110
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you think like that,</v>

1037
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:32.580
<v Speaker 4>then the only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not freedom.</v>

1038
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 4>It's not liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the constitution,</v>

1039
00:45:34.261 --> 00:45:36.600
<v Speaker 4>it's that we are the policemen of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and we're the big dog.</v>

1040
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:38.520
<v Speaker 4>And once we lose that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're no longer great.</v>

1041
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 4>How the heck did we ever survive up </v>
<v Speaker 4>until the second world war?</v>

1042
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:42.943
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this strikes me as a good segue to </v>

1043
00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:46.110
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you talk about history?</v>

1044
00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:47.070
<v Speaker 4>Carlin?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

1045
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:47.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1046
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:50.370
<v Speaker 4>not with qualifications,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just as a fan.</v>

1047
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.890
<v Speaker 4>So you're technically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not a historian.</v>

1048
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:55.320
<v Speaker 4>I know you're up front about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're hardcore history.</v>

1049
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:56.154
<v Speaker 4>You do an incredible job of basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>storytelling history with a little </v>

1050
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:01.554
<v Speaker 4>present day context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you see that as sort of the best way </v>

1051
00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:08.250
<v Speaker 4>to get people to understand history?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It started off as a show for fans,</v>

1052
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:09.084
<v Speaker 4>which is what I am.</v>

1053
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.370
<v Speaker 4>I have a history degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a simple ba and,</v>

1054
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:13.020
<v Speaker 4>and we used to do these shows where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would just,</v>

1055
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.153
<v Speaker 4>I assumed that the audience understood </v>
<v Speaker 4>the story and so we were just talking </v>

1056
00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:17.694
<v Speaker 4>about the weird things in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think the first show we ever </v>

1057
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:20.454
<v Speaker 4>did was 15 or 20 minutes and of course </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last one I just did was six hours </v>

1058
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.173
<v Speaker 4>and so you can see I never would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>done it if I'd known it was going to be </v>

1059
00:46:25.891 --> 00:46:26.724
<v Speaker 4>six hours long or multipart episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then people would write us and it </v>

1060
00:46:29.131 --> 00:46:31.080
<v Speaker 4>wasn't the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was going to pay attention.</v>

1061
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:31.914
<v Speaker 4>They would say I liked those twists or </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we call Lou twilight zone musings </v>

1062
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 4>and they said like those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know the background.</v>

1063
00:46:38.281 --> 00:46:40.740
<v Speaker 4>Can you give me more background in is as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you well know,</v>

1064
00:46:40.741 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 4>and I always say Seinfeld wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>Seinfeld for the first 10 episodes.</v>

1065
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:44.843
<v Speaker 4>Every show has to sort of evolve into </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it's going to be and we started </v>

1066
00:46:47.611 --> 00:46:49.950
<v Speaker 4>evolving towards giving a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>more information,</v>

1067
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:50.784
<v Speaker 4>then a little bit more information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we had to find out how a non </v>

1068
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.883
<v Speaker 4>academically qualified person can </v>
<v Speaker 4>transmit this story in a way where you </v>

1069
00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:01.720
<v Speaker 4>could reasonably think you could trust </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and I,</v>

1070
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.930
<v Speaker 4>I came up with something we call in shop</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

1071
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.000
<v Speaker 4>audio footnotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is okay.</v>

1072
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:06.834
<v Speaker 4>Carlin says something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I back it up with something that a </v>

1073
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:10.164
<v Speaker 4>historian says and then we point out </v>
<v Speaker 4>which has turned out to be one of the </v>

1074
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:12.684
<v Speaker 4>most fun things of the program for </v>
<v Speaker 4>listeners that historians don't agree </v>

1075
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 4>because listeners always assumed some of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them anyway,</v>

1076
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:21.630
<v Speaker 4>that there was a history and that that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it was to find out that history is a</v>

1077
00:47:21.631 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 4>little bit more like from 500 years from</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1078
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:24.654
<v Speaker 4>somebody having an msnbc or Fox News </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of that that turned on a lot of </v>

1079
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the show evolved</v>

1080
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.173
<v Speaker 3>into what it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which part of what it does is show you </v>

1081
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 3>how we call it historiography in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1082
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.540
<v Speaker 3>but how history is put together and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of,</v>

1083
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.350
<v Speaker 3>and how it can change over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1084
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.860
<v Speaker 3>and so what was the original question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave?</v>

1085
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:42.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll shift.</v>

1086
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:43.710
<v Speaker 3>I should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he got,</v>

1087
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it basically got it there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll shift to this,</v>

1088
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:47.134
<v Speaker 3>which is how I started at the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show that I am a firm believer that </v>

1089
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:50.704
<v Speaker 3>history repeats itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why what I think you're doing </v>

1090
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:53.194
<v Speaker 3>is so irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there something historical that we </v>

1091
00:47:56.141 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 3>can look to for our politics right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>

1092
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was Kinda like that.</v>

1093
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.103
<v Speaker 3>Or are we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is trump really thrown in such a </v>

1094
00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:07.360
<v Speaker 3>wildcard here that there's nothing we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can look and go?</v>

1095
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:08.710
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of close to that.</v>

1096
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I've always had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think his,</v>

1097
00:48:10.421 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mark Twain,</v>

1098
00:48:11.651 --> 00:48:13.510
<v Speaker 3>I think it was mark Twain who said </v>
<v Speaker 3>history doesn't repeat itself,</v>

1099
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:15.460
<v Speaker 3>but it sometimes rhymes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1100
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that,</v>

1101
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:17.853
<v Speaker 3>it's not that history is so cyclical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that there's a constant element in </v>

1102
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:23.510
<v Speaker 3>it and it's us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1103
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.690
<v Speaker 3>It's human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did Shakespeare say?</v>

1104
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:27.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the world's a stage and all the,</v>

1105
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:28.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people,</v>

1106
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:31.270
<v Speaker 3>merely players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tapestries change.</v>

1107
00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.400
<v Speaker 3>But if you could pull people out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>

1108
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.293
<v Speaker 3>other than the fact that they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to seem like different cultures because </v>

1109
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:37.450
<v Speaker 3>they were raised in completely different</v>
<v Speaker 3>environments,</v>

1110
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 3>there's still people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1111
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:41.590
<v Speaker 3>If you measured them with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with sensory equipment,</v>

1112
00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:43.270
<v Speaker 3>they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to score the same.</v>

1113
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.790
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why it seems similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you look back,</v>

1114
00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:48.220
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the fall of the Roman republic,</v>

1115
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 3>you have two things that are similar.</v>

1116
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.193
<v Speaker 3>One human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so with the same passions and desires </v>

1117
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.840
<v Speaker 3>and foibles and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you have systems.</v>

1118
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 3>So the reason people always look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rome,</v>

1119
00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.773
<v Speaker 3>the Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody thinks empire and it's the </v>

1120
00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:00.604
<v Speaker 3>public that's similar is because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a government that is formed </v>

1121
00:49:04.121 --> 00:49:06.310
<v Speaker 3>because ours was deliberately modeled on</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of those.</v>

1122
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.443
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have a similar system and then </v>

1123
00:49:08.471 --> 00:49:09.304
<v Speaker 3>you throw human beings into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see things that are </v>

1124
00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Speaker 3>similar because there are patterns that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to reemerge.</v>

1125
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Does that give you any predictive value?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not.</v>

1126
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That history doesn't teach you how,</v>

1127
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.290
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the,</v>

1128
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.920
<v Speaker 3>the right wing always tells you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1129
00:49:21.921 --> 00:49:23.980
<v Speaker 3>the Hitler and Munich and appeasement </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught you.</v>

1130
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1131
00:49:25.091 --> 00:49:25.924
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It taught you what you can do with </v>

1132
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Hitler in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the variables mess that up.</v>

1133
00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.143
<v Speaker 3>So history doesn't teach you how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it can tell you a lot about who we </v>

1134
00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:36.250
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's basically,</v>

1135
00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:37.084
<v Speaker 3>it's just humans really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just humans within the time frame </v>

1136
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:42.070
<v Speaker 3>that they happen to humans and systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1137
00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:42.904
<v Speaker 3>Human Systems and culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you can take people even now </v>

1138
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 3>from different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you took,</v>

1139
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 3>if you took people from a completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different culture right here,</v>

1140
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.693
<v Speaker 3>go to central Africa and replace all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans tomorrow and take them to put </v>

1141
00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:56.284
<v Speaker 3>them in central Africa to take all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the central Africans to put them in the </v>

1142
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 3>United States and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's your system.</v>

1143
00:49:59.351 --> 00:50:00.184
<v Speaker 3>Donald trumps your president and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a midterm election in two years </v>

1144
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:03.603
<v Speaker 3>they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's going to be a few </v>

1145
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:05.584
<v Speaker 3>differences in the voting patterns?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to factor culture </v>

1146
00:50:08.021 --> 00:50:08.854
<v Speaker 3>systems and us the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's why history is important </v>

1147
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:13.444
<v Speaker 3>because it really teaches you about us </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a species through cultures and </v>

1148
00:50:18.851 --> 00:50:20.560
<v Speaker 3>through time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.413
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a beautiful way to phrase </v>

1150
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:24.070
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that their historical events you have to</v>

1151
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:26.440
<v Speaker 3>know about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But really what you're learning about is</v>

1152
00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 3>just sort of the nature of being human.</v>

1153
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 4>And that's argued,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is there a human nature?</v>

1154
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.450
<v Speaker 4>But certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1155
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.313
<v Speaker 4>we have parameters within which most of </v>
<v Speaker 4>us operate and whether the culture </v>

1156
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:40.430
<v Speaker 4>expands those parameters over time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's still,</v>

1157
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>love is love,</v>

1158
00:50:41.691 --> 00:50:43.280
<v Speaker 4>hate is hate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexist sex.</v>

1159
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:44.114
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's certain things that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we see the similarities in </v>

1160
00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:49.490
<v Speaker 4>primates when you look at them now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1161
00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:50.443
<v Speaker 4>so that's what connects you to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient Egyptian where almost nothing </v>

1162
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:54.460
<v Speaker 4>else would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1163
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still people.</v>

1164
00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 4>And when you read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1165
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:03.220
<v Speaker 4>the epitaphs that the ancient Romans </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote on the equivalent of tombstones of</v>

1166
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 4>their children who died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it touches your heart today.</v>

1167
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:07.904
<v Speaker 4>The way you can relate and the only </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason you can relate is because if you </v>

1168
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:11.654
<v Speaker 4>took a Roman baby and put him in a time </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine and brought him now and raised </v>

1169
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:16.244
<v Speaker 4>him as one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would be indistinguishable and vice </v>

1170
00:51:18.111 --> 00:51:18.944
<v Speaker 4>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would like watching public </v>

1171
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:21.524
<v Speaker 4>executions for entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I took you as a child and raised you </v>

1172
00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:25.520
<v Speaker 4>back in the Middle Ages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1173
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure we're going to get back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that too.</v>

1174
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've ever seen,</v>

1175
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:34.130
<v Speaker 2>we do know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not that far from it.</v>

1176
00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:34.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1177
00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:35.300
<v Speaker 2>we really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1178
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.560
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are parts of the world,</v>

1179
00:51:36.561 --> 00:51:37.394
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're beheading people on the streets </v>

1180
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 2>and plenty of people watch and cheer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

1181
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Are they that much different than us or </v>
<v Speaker 2>is their system,</v>

1182
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.760
<v Speaker 2>and I guess that's what you would argue </v>
<v Speaker 2>the system around them has just led them</v>

1183
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.710
<v Speaker 2>to cheering that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>

1184
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:49.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cultural systems systems lock you in </v>

1185
00:51:51.501 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 4>like a republic locks you into certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1186
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.850
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Rome,</v>

1187
00:51:55.851 --> 00:51:56.840
<v Speaker 4>the part that just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1188
00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 4>you look at it and you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gosh,</v>

1189
00:51:58.161 --> 00:51:58.994
<v Speaker 4>it looks so similar as a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Contributions and money and favors with </v>

1190
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:02.414
<v Speaker 4>powerful people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the ability of the powerful to </v>

1191
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:05.191
<v Speaker 4>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1192
00:52:05.191 --> 00:52:06.024
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wonderful part of Roman republic </v>

1193
00:52:07.311 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 4>history for me is when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you read about the,</v>

1194
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:12.480
<v Speaker 4>the attempts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1195
00:52:12.481 --> 00:52:14.290
<v Speaker 4>of the people who were known as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

1196
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:16.700
<v Speaker 4>the groggy brothers are famous as the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the,</v>

1197
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 4>you would call them the champions of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>poor today.</v>

1198
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Maybe like you would say the Bernie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sanders types or whatever.</v>

1199
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:23.443
<v Speaker 4>But what I love about reading the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 4>history and Rome is great because you </v>

1200
00:52:25.731 --> 00:52:26.564
<v Speaker 4>have so much history that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually look at and study is that the </v>

1201
00:52:28.791 --> 00:52:32.360
<v Speaker 4>people at the time would say that's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they really believe.</v>

1202
00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.430
<v Speaker 4>They're just trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds so good.</v>

1203
00:52:35.431 --> 00:52:38.390
<v Speaker 4>Were being paid off by the Koch brothers</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so when you read it,</v>

1204
00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 4>you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a systems thing,</v>

1205
00:52:40.011 --> 00:52:40.844
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their system looks like our system and </v>

1206
00:52:42.981 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 4>because of that you throw human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>as they always are into that system.</v>

1207
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:49.160
<v Speaker 4>The culture part is what makes it very </v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

1208
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.550
<v Speaker 4>but I mean you can see echoes of who we </v>
<v Speaker 4>still are today.</v>

1209
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:54.160
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a predictive tool?</v>

1210
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:56.360
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you do look at it and you go,</v>

1211
00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:57.194
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are interesting animals and I see it </v>

1212
00:52:59.751 --> 00:53:01.640
<v Speaker 4>over thousands of years of difference.</v>

1213
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel this question may come off a </v>

1214
00:53:03.451 --> 00:53:04.284
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little too easy or a little too </v>

1215
00:53:05.791 --> 00:53:06.624
<v Speaker 2>cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are there a couple leaders </v>

1216
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.920
<v Speaker 2>throughout time that you look at it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like truly special in their time?</v>

1217
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is everything that you've said.</v>

1218
00:53:16.771 --> 00:53:17.604
<v Speaker 2>Making sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like accepting that a lot of it's human </v>

1219
00:53:18.931 --> 00:53:21.330
<v Speaker 2>nature and the time they live in and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system they live in and all that.</v>

1220
00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:22.164
<v Speaker 2>But were there a couple that somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even one that just somehow within </v>

1221
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>that moment</v>

1222
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.980
<v Speaker 4>did something truly special?</v>
<v Speaker 4>See Age old question,</v>

1223
00:53:28.981 --> 00:53:29.701
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much,</v>

1224
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:30.534
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much do the leaders push things </v>

1225
00:53:31.891 --> 00:53:32.724
<v Speaker 4>versus how much do the trends and forces</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the time period created an opening </v>

1226
00:53:35.371 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 4>that someone fills?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1227
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:39.660
<v Speaker 4>trump is the perfect example of a trends</v>
<v Speaker 4>and forces guy.</v>

1228
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:40.913
<v Speaker 4>I mean we have a situation here where a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vacuum was created that someone was </v>

1229
00:53:43.501 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 4>going to step into and he walked into </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1230
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:47.490
<v Speaker 4>He didn't push this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't make this,</v>

1231
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:48.443
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he benefited from it and he took </v>

1232
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:50.244
<v Speaker 4>advantage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the beneficiary of the trends and </v>

1233
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:53.490
<v Speaker 4>forces that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we said earlier,</v>

1234
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.860
<v Speaker 4>had been 40 or 50 years at least in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>making.</v>

1235
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he didn't push it at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1236
00:53:57.661 --> 00:54:00.560
<v Speaker 4>some of the tactics that he think it </v>
<v Speaker 4>really was.</v>

1237
00:54:00.561 --> 00:54:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's why he has to have a,</v>

1238
00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:05.160
<v Speaker 4>the advisers he does to try to keep him </v>
<v Speaker 4>in touch with the,</v>

1239
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:06.800
<v Speaker 4>with the current trends as they are in.</v>

1240
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.733
<v Speaker 4>And not just the current trends society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the current trends amongst the </v>

1241
00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:11.400
<v Speaker 4>people who are his supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1242
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.780
<v Speaker 4>He has to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1243
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 4>Bannon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1244
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 4>how will this play amongst the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he doesn't know.</v>

1245
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:17.544
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe if you look at trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we always thought trump was either a </v>

1246
00:54:20.581 --> 00:54:23.160
<v Speaker 4>centrist democrat or a centrist </v>
<v Speaker 4>Republican.</v>

1247
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.203
<v Speaker 4>For him to have the most right wing </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration in anyone's memory is a </v>

1248
00:54:27.811 --> 00:54:28.644
<v Speaker 4>bit of a shock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was able to read the lay of the </v>

1249
00:54:31.171 --> 00:54:36.171
<v Speaker 4>land and know that there was this crowd </v>
<v Speaker 4>that had been created by the dynamics of</v>

1250
00:54:36.961 --> 00:54:40.390
<v Speaker 4>the last 40 or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the anger over the situation that,</v>

1251
00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.260
<v Speaker 4>that he could play to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he doesn't know intrinsically how to</v>

1252
00:54:43.261 --> 00:54:44.490
<v Speaker 4>play to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's not him.</v>

1253
00:54:44.491 --> 00:54:45.720
<v Speaker 4>He has to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1254
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.310
<v Speaker 4>How will this move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1255
00:54:47.311 --> 00:54:48.144
<v Speaker 4>react.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1256
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.890
<v Speaker 4>so he's a trends and forces guy.</v>

1257
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 4>When you look at people that push the </v>
<v Speaker 4>envelope,</v>

1258
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.730
<v Speaker 4>you look for people who are wildly </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

1259
00:54:56.731 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 4>And that doesn't mean good necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1260
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always impressed with the geniuses.</v>

1261
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:03.203
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that that a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Julius Caesar did not benefit from the </v>

1262
00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:08.190
<v Speaker 4>trends and forces of his time because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

1263
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 4>But when you read about a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Caesar and you find out that he was able</v>

1264
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 4>to sit there in his litter going from </v>
<v Speaker 4>place to place,</v>

1265
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.570
<v Speaker 4>dictating three letters at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1266
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you sit there and go,</v>

1267
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 4>well that's a really unusual human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

1268
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 4>So you put those human beings in certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>situations and you'd say,</v>

1269
00:55:24.511 --> 00:55:25.344
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that situation turned out in a way that </v>

1270
00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:29.340
<v Speaker 4>it never would have turned out had it </v>
<v Speaker 4>not been for that person.</v>

1271
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:30.533
<v Speaker 4>So there's always an interplay between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the trends and forces and the </v>

1272
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:34.740
<v Speaker 4>individuals who are exploiting them.</v>

1273
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 4>It's hard always to separate the line </v>
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>

1274
00:55:37.111 --> 00:55:37.944
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happened because of that guy or </v>

1275
00:55:39.751 --> 00:55:41.100
<v Speaker 4>that woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1276
00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:44.130
<v Speaker 4>so when you say historical figures that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>

1277
00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:45.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1278
00:55:45.421 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 4>I gravitate toward the horrible people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know why.</v>

1279
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:49.823
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you look at Alexander the Great's </v>

1280
00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.314
<v Speaker 4>the one I always look out because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even with all the hyperbole and there's </v>

1281
00:55:55.531 --> 00:55:57.390
<v Speaker 4>a ton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fascinates me.</v>

1282
00:55:57.391 --> 00:55:58.224
<v Speaker 4>He fascinates me because of even the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different views that historians have </v>

1283
00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:02.910
<v Speaker 4>over him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either he was the enlightened,</v>

1284
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.013
<v Speaker 4>a example of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a philosopher king or he was a total </v>

1285
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:09.390
<v Speaker 4>butcher who's been totally mythologized </v>
<v Speaker 4>later on.</v>

1286
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:10.403
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to be able to examine the many </v>

1287
00:56:12.211 --> 00:56:13.044
<v Speaker 4>facets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1288
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:16.710
<v Speaker 4>imagine yourself in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 4>500 or a thousand years from now,</v>

1289
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:17.693
<v Speaker 4>somebody on one hand is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain you and they're taking all of </v>

1290
00:56:21.031 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 4>your qualities that are the best of you.</v>

1291
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.290
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and portraying Dave Ruben as that,</v>

1292
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:27.850
<v Speaker 4>but then the other hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1293
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 4>But then the other person takes all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the qualities of the worst of you,</v>

1294
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 4>creates a finger or a version of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1295
00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:34.660
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1296
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 4>and then multi versions in between that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I can't,</v>

1297
00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:40.150
<v Speaker 4>so when you say the most fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1298
00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:40.984
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it's not what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the many versions of them that </v>

1299
00:56:44.921 --> 00:56:45.850
<v Speaker 4>you see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1300
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:48.310
<v Speaker 4>The mini holograms of Alexander the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Great and,</v>

1301
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.620
<v Speaker 4>and dressed up in all the different </v>
<v Speaker 4>forms.</v>

1302
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:52.330
<v Speaker 4>Evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible guy,</v>

1303
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:52.991
<v Speaker 4>Greg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1304
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:53.824
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm moved by the figures that are </v>

1305
00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:56.524
<v Speaker 4>larger than life and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I enjoy watching how they'd been </v>

1306
00:56:59.231 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 4>mythologized you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I think we do that today.</v>

1307
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.440
<v Speaker 4>I think liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1308
00:57:02.441 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 4>of mythologized Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives in mythologize Reagan,</v>

1309
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.060
<v Speaker 4>I've seen the Reagan thing in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifetime,</v>

1310
00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:07.894
<v Speaker 4>which I considered to be a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching tool for me to then look and </v>

1311
00:57:11.321 --> 00:57:11.980
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1312
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 4>I've watched how that happens in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you can see,</v>

1313
00:57:14.561 --> 00:57:15.394
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's obviously happened with all these </v>

1314
00:57:16.211 --> 00:57:17.370
<v Speaker 4>other people in history too.</v>

1315
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's funny though with the </v>

1316
00:57:19.561 --> 00:57:20.394
<v Speaker 2>Reagan thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like he was obviously the hero of </v>

1317
00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans for the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1318
00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:24.893
<v Speaker 2>30 years and the standard bearer of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>a republican deliberately making </v>

1319
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.043
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there was this thing in the </v>

1320
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:31.463
<v Speaker 2>last year were Democrats were saying a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of Nice things about him because </v>

1321
00:57:33.391 --> 00:57:35.700
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to prove that trump was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1322
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:40.140
<v Speaker 2>So it was like they took the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they hated the most to try to trick,</v>

1323
00:57:40.141 --> 00:57:42.180
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well of</v>

1324
00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.500
<v Speaker 4>why it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1325
00:57:43.501 --> 00:57:46.290
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we create a metaphor,</v>

1326
00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We create,</v>

1327
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:49.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an image and weed and listen,</v>

1328
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.640
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're singling out Reagan,</v>

1329
00:57:50.641 --> 00:57:51.990
<v Speaker 4>but this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why I like it.</v>

1330
00:57:51.991 --> 00:57:54.000
<v Speaker 4>It's the human thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did it with Alexandra to,</v>

1331
00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:57.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take a person and as soon as they're</v>

1332
00:57:57.031 --> 00:57:57.864
<v Speaker 4>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can easily compress them into a two </v>

1333
00:57:59.641 --> 00:58:00.474
<v Speaker 4>dimensional version of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can use them as a symbol </v>

1334
00:58:02.821 --> 00:58:05.460
<v Speaker 4>for what you want them to represent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1335
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:06.383
<v Speaker 4>And if you could bring these people back</v>
<v Speaker 4>now and show them in there in the 360 </v>

1336
00:58:09.871 --> 00:58:12.330
<v Speaker 4>degrees of the human that they really </v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1337
00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:13.283
<v Speaker 4>it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be,</v>

1338
00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:14.123
<v Speaker 4>it'd be amazing to compare them to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mythology that's been created about </v>

1339
00:58:17.821 --> 00:58:19.800
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you see it done to one person,</v>

1340
00:58:19.801 --> 00:58:20.634
<v Speaker 4>it allows you then in your mind's eye to</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand how the process works all </v>

1341
00:58:23.071 --> 00:58:25.380
<v Speaker 4>throughout history and not just with </v>
<v Speaker 4>good people,</v>

1342
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:27.360
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes with evil people too.</v>

1343
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go read mine comp,</v>

1344
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.713
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the very first history show we did was </v>

1345
00:58:31.921 --> 00:58:32.754
<v Speaker 4>asking whether or not Alexander the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Great was a better or worse person than </v>

1346
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:36.264
<v Speaker 4>Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the attitude in it was that if the </v>

1347
00:58:39.811 --> 00:58:40.970
<v Speaker 4>stories are true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

1348
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.350
<v Speaker 4>we'll throw the big asterisk if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories are true.</v>

1349
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:47.790
<v Speaker 4>Maybe Alexander the Great was killing </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the people he killed because it made</v>

1350
00:58:47.791 --> 00:58:49.920
<v Speaker 4>Alexander the Great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bigger historical figure.</v>

1351
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Whereas when you read mind comp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler's a twisted human being a product</v>

1352
00:58:54.481 --> 00:58:58.140
<v Speaker 4>of his time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he thinks he's doing something good,</v>

1353
00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.013
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think you're doing something </v>

1354
00:58:59.971 --> 00:59:02.940
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that make you a somewhat less evil?</v>

1355
00:59:02.941 --> 00:59:05.550
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the guy who killed all these people</v>

1356
00:59:05.551 --> 00:59:08.550
<v Speaker 4>cause it made him a bigger figure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a,</v>

1357
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.880
<v Speaker 4>that's a heretical thing to say in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>blossom.</v>

1358
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.970
<v Speaker 4>This thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the point is,</v>

1359
00:59:11.971 --> 00:59:12.804
<v Speaker 4>is that do human beings literally go out</v>
<v Speaker 4>to commit evil or sometimes do they go </v>

1360
00:59:16.891 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 4>out to commit good or are these just </v>
<v Speaker 4>byproducts or mistakes or,</v>

1361
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.910
<v Speaker 4>or accidents of history.</v>

1362
00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:23.571
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to be clear,</v>

1363
00:59:23.571 --> 00:59:24.404
<v Speaker 4>you're not saying Hitler was good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying never said Hitler was </v>

1364
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:27.860
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to clean it.</v>

1365
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:28.820
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to clear that up.</v>

1366
00:59:28.821 --> 00:59:29.654
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that this twisted thing </v>

1367
00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he himself believed it was good.</v>

1368
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's what we need to do.</v>

1369
00:59:34.851 --> 00:59:35.684
<v Speaker 4>We need to get rid of all the Jews cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna make things better for </v>

1370
00:59:37.071 --> 00:59:37.904
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make him better than the guy </v>

1371
00:59:38.511 --> 00:59:40.850
<v Speaker 4>that gets rid of all the Jews?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the more Jews I killed,</v>

1372
00:59:40.851 --> 00:59:42.170
<v Speaker 4>the bigger figure I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1373
00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.450
<v Speaker 4>The whole question is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1374
00:59:44.451 --> 00:59:45.284
<v Speaker 4>But that's what history allows us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>play with and ask ourselves as we </v>

1375
00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:49.304
<v Speaker 4>mythologize change and as many decades </v>
<v Speaker 4>pass and we forget either the good </v>

1376
00:59:53.391 --> 00:59:55.370
<v Speaker 4>points or the bad points of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>figures,</v>

1377
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:56.413
<v Speaker 4>how do we create a figure that if we </v>
<v Speaker 4>could go back in time and see them as </v>

1378
00:59:58.641 --> 00:59:59.474
<v Speaker 4>they really were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we wouldn't recognize the real figure </v>

1379
01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:01.490
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1380
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:03.200
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy's been mythologized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1381
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.730
<v Speaker 4>this is the guy who served three years </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1382
01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:07.010
<v Speaker 4>often didn't know what I mean other than</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Cuban missile crisis,</v>

1383
01:00:07.011 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 4>which was crazy how good it performed in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1384
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.630
<v Speaker 4>If you went back and really elected the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy today,</v>

1385
01:00:11.631 --> 01:00:13.100
<v Speaker 4>how many liberals would be happy with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>

1386
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.143
<v Speaker 4>Just like if you really brought Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 4>back today and put him in front of </v>

1387
01:00:16.731 --> 01:00:17.564
<v Speaker 4>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might look like a guy that you </v>

1388
01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:21.590
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't vote for it because he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative enough.</v>

1389
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:21.951
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1390
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.050
<v Speaker 4>that's the funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for Kennedy it would be,</v>

1391
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:26.510
<v Speaker 4>you'd get some classical liberals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives voting for him,</v>

1392
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:27.750
<v Speaker 4>but the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the left.</v>

1393
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1394
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1395
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:31.303
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the myth is different and the myths </v>

1396
01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:34.004
<v Speaker 4>serves purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're able to put a wonderful bust or </v>

1397
01:00:36.651 --> 01:00:37.484
<v Speaker 4>you could put a picture of them at your </v>
<v Speaker 4>convention as look at the wonderful </v>

1398
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:41.150
<v Speaker 4>heroes the Democratic Party's had.</v>

1399
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:42.800
<v Speaker 4>We've had Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've had roosevelt,</v>

1400
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.930
<v Speaker 4>but would you want any of them today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>

1401
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:46.123
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's almost like we need Greek </v>

1402
01:00:47.451 --> 01:00:50.240
<v Speaker 4>mythology in our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our system we need here,</v>

1403
01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:51.074
<v Speaker 4>or we need marvel superheroes or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that represent these things </v>

1404
01:00:53.871 --> 01:00:57.530
<v Speaker 4>because the people behind them are all </v>
<v Speaker 4>flawed and are screwed up as the rest of</v>

1405
01:00:57.531 --> 01:00:58.780
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1406
01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:00.380
<v Speaker 4>this is the thing about Martin Luther </v>
<v Speaker 4>King,</v>

1407
01:01:00.381 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 4>I always try to explain to people is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that here you've,</v>

1408
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 4>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've created somebody that we can have</v>

1409
01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:05.624
<v Speaker 4>a Martin Luther King Day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like the George Washington </v>

1410
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.170
<v Speaker 4>chopping the Cherry Tree Down Day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1411
01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.273
<v Speaker 4>People forget Martin Luther King.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go look at the speeches that he was </v>

1412
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:15.530
<v Speaker 4>giving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was harsh on the American system,</v>

1413
01:01:15.531 --> 01:01:16.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did he say?</v>

1414
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:19.160
<v Speaker 4>That he's something the focus evil of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the modern world,</v>

1415
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:19.994
<v Speaker 4>and forget the exact quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of those things that gets </v>

1416
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:25.190
<v Speaker 4>really downplayed when we talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mythology.</v>

1417
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:26.023
<v Speaker 4>You know that they play up the sides </v>
<v Speaker 4>that serve the purposes of us now and </v>

1418
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:32.390
<v Speaker 4>play down the parts where the man was </v>
<v Speaker 4>really revolutionary.</v>

1419
01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:33.224
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my favorite Martin Luther King's </v>

1420
01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:35.274
<v Speaker 4>speeches or the stuff we never talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about anymore because they really edgy </v>

1421
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:38.893
<v Speaker 4>but edgy doesn't serve the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hero worship and that's how we always </v>

1422
01:01:42.471 --> 01:01:43.150
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1423
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.983
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he evolved that of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff or also as a just a way to go </v>

1424
01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:51.440
<v Speaker 4>mainstream to no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because here's the thing we forget now.</v>

1425
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:54.320
<v Speaker 4>Mainstream is what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When when king is marching,</v>

1426
01:01:54.321 --> 01:01:55.154
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we forget that civil rights was not </v>

1427
01:01:57.771 --> 01:01:59.180
<v Speaker 4>something that everybody was going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1428
01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:00.014
<v Speaker 4>we should have civil rights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that way to simply be asking </v>

1429
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:03.914
<v Speaker 4>to get rid of separate but equal in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>south is radical and they're turning </v>

1430
01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 4>fire hoses on you and setting dogs on </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1431
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.760
<v Speaker 4>and a good 40 to 60% of the country is </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking those are bad people today.</v>

1432
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 4>If you showed the same today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number</v>

1433
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 3>of people that would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1434
01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 3>that's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be in the 90 percentile.</v>

1435
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:28.020
<v Speaker 3>But that's because we've moved on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in part because of what those people</v>

1436
01:02:28.021 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 3>went through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1437
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.233
<v Speaker 3>Martin Luther King is more of a hero now</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the times have changed in part </v>

1438
01:02:32.671 --> 01:02:35.600
<v Speaker 3>because of Martin Luther King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that he's not seen as the radical.</v>

1439
01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 3>He was go read the things the FBI said </v>
<v Speaker 3>about him and their minds.</v>

1440
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.320
<v Speaker 3>He's a communist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1441
01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:41.154
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go kill yourself was what they fbi </v>

1442
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Speaker 3>letter send to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go Kill Yourself.</v>

1443
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you even imagine today?</v>

1444
01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:47.514
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what happens is when we have these </v>

1445
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:50.610
<v Speaker 3>figures that are radical and </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial at the time,</v>

1446
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.593
<v Speaker 3>if they were ahead of their times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they end up looking like much more </v>

1447
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.053
<v Speaker 3>banal figures than they really were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin Luther King was revolutionary is </v>

1448
01:03:00.661 --> 01:03:03.540
<v Speaker 3>too strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but edgy and in a good way,</v>

1449
01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:04.170
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion.</v>

1450
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:07.740
<v Speaker 3>But now of course he looks edgy in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we've all gone that route right at</v>

1451
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:08.574
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of people that didn't </v>

1452
01:03:09.751 --> 01:03:11.750
<v Speaker 3>like his stance and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you think kings edge,</v>

1453
01:03:11.751 --> 01:03:13.870
<v Speaker 3>you look at Malcolm X.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1454
01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.990
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So any means necessary.</v>

1455
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:16.853
<v Speaker 3>So as someone that talks about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution and the separation of </v>

1456
01:03:19.471 --> 01:03:21.630
<v Speaker 3>powers and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just mentioned separate,</v>

1457
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:22.920
<v Speaker 3>separate but equal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1458
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible to me.</v>

1459
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:25.434
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our constitution it says all men are </v>

1460
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:29.730
<v Speaker 3>created equal and yet these same people </v>
<v Speaker 3>had slaves.</v>

1461
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:30.833
<v Speaker 3>Eventually we freed the slaves and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to a place where we were allowed </v>

1462
01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:35.250
<v Speaker 3>to have separate schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they were equal,</v>

1463
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.710
<v Speaker 3>if they were equal but separate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that was okay.</v>

1464
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:39.203
<v Speaker 3>But is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that arc always bending towards </v>

1465
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:41.334
<v Speaker 3>justice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I know it seems like right now </v>

1466
01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:43.524
<v Speaker 3>everyone is more at each other's throats</v>
<v Speaker 3>than ever before and angrier and more </v>

1467
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:47.460
<v Speaker 3>divided and all that stuff.</v>

1468
01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:48.870
<v Speaker 3>But I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would argue,</v>

1469
01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:50.370
<v Speaker 3>and I've had a lot of guests come on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>argue this,</v>

1470
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:51.204
<v Speaker 3>that basically things have gotten a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and we're always going to have </v>

1471
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:55.703
<v Speaker 3>problems for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't mean we can always be </v>

1472
01:03:56.971 --> 01:03:57.804
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that really things have gotten a </v>

1473
01:03:59.731 --> 01:04:00.564
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount better in large part </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if we were just governed by the </v>

1474
01:04:03.301 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 3>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty great thing.</v>

1475
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I require clarification on the word </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1476
01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:09.563
<v Speaker 3>Better in that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are a more just society and the </v>

1477
01:04:12.771 --> 01:04:13.604
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The United States specifically is a </v>

1478
01:04:15.691 --> 01:04:16.524
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has consistently become a more just </v>

1479
01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:21.150
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every decade that has gone by basically.</v>

1480
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.850
<v Speaker 3>I am sure we could probably find some </v>
<v Speaker 3>setbacks.</v>

1481
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could think of a good person </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>

1482
01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Damn Carlin answer,</v>

1483
01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:28.944
<v Speaker 3>because wine is going to be different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than anybody else's made me is that I </v>

1484
01:04:31.351 --> 01:04:32.310
<v Speaker 3>want you to speak for everybody.</v>

1485
01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:35.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm here now,</v>

1486
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.320
<v Speaker 3>I thought the first 15 minutes we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking for everybody,</v>

1487
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:40.003
<v Speaker 3>Dan Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the way I look at it when I grew </v>

1488
01:04:41.371 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1489
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.473
<v Speaker 3>I think we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our expectation levels are set at an </v>

1490
01:04:45.001 --> 01:04:45.834
<v Speaker 3>early age and so the era I grew up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 1970s I consider to be the high </v>

1491
01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.960
<v Speaker 3>watermark of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1492
01:04:51.961 --> 01:04:52.794
<v Speaker 3>things like journalism and as a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who feels and came up in the </v>

1493
01:04:55.411 --> 01:04:57.180
<v Speaker 3>journalistic profession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my background.</v>

1494
01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.600
<v Speaker 3>I have a high minded idealistic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even inaccurate historical view of</v>

1495
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:04.554
<v Speaker 3>how I see journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at journalism </v>

1496
01:05:06.301 --> 01:05:07.410
<v Speaker 3>throughout most of the country's </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1497
01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:11.010
<v Speaker 3>it starts off in Revolutionary Times as </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely,</v>

1498
01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:12.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're just yelling awful things</v>

1499
01:05:12.991 --> 01:05:13.824
<v Speaker 3>to each other in different papers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the personal attacks and that's why you </v>

1500
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 3>have libel and slander.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't</v>

1501
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.701
<v Speaker 4>realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1502
01:05:18.701 --> 01:05:19.130
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>

1503
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.940
<v Speaker 4>it used to be a lot of heroin people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

1504
01:05:20.941 --> 01:05:23.060
<v Speaker 4>they speak to each other so horribly now</v>
<v Speaker 4>full.</v>

1505
01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.153
<v Speaker 4>And then you go to the periods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at the 1930s and forties and </v>

1506
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:28.330
<v Speaker 4>it's all corporate stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1507
01:05:28.331 --> 01:05:30.170
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the stuff that just fed to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a,</v>

1508
01:05:30.171 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you get to the,</v>

1509
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.860
<v Speaker 4>the 1960s and even then it's still what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we would call today almost propaganda.</v>

1510
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Then you get to the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the post Watergate period is this little</v>

1511
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:45.810
<v Speaker 4>teeny era where it was the way I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it should always be.</v>

1512
01:05:46.191 --> 01:05:47.920
<v Speaker 4>And if I'm speaking for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the way it should all be.</v>

1513
01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it was rough.</v>

1514
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.180
<v Speaker 4>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listener once told me,</v>

1515
01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.700
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he sent me the speech,</v>

1516
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.120
<v Speaker 4>a Katharine Graham who was the editor of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Washington Post,</v>

1517
01:05:58.450 --> 01:05:59.283
<v Speaker 4>had had to give a big speech after </v>
<v Speaker 4>Watergate to all the big wig people and </v>

1518
01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:04.870
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry,</v>

1519
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.430
<v Speaker 4>this isn't going to be a trend.</v>

1520
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.140
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1521
01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>expose everybody all the time because it</v>

1522
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:12.670
<v Speaker 4>was so unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

1523
01:06:12.671 --> 01:06:15.370
<v Speaker 4>if you go look at 60 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way 60 minutes used to be,</v>

1524
01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 4>they used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the worst thing that could happen to you</v>

1525
01:06:16.901 --> 01:06:19.600
<v Speaker 4>was to see Mike Wallace of 60 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking up your driveway.</v>

1526
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:20.470
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Run.</v>

1527
01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't do that anymore.</v>

1528
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.793
<v Speaker 4>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we had the kind of media that we had </v>

1529
01:06:26.051 --> 01:06:26.884
<v Speaker 4>in the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much of what I disagree with today </v>

1530
01:06:29.591 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 4>could not stand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the idea of sunlight being the</v>

1531
01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:35.860
<v Speaker 4>antiseptic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we talked about it and if we had,</v>

1532
01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:36.694
<v Speaker 4>the problem with media fragmentation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're not all seeing the same </v>

1533
01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:40.234
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1534
01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:42.640
<v Speaker 4>now is that good or bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>

1535
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:43.310
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1536
01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:44.143
<v Speaker 4>it's something you way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the water cooler discussions in </v>

1537
01:06:47.051 --> 01:06:47.884
<v Speaker 4>the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were at least all talking about the </v>

1538
01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:49.510
<v Speaker 4>same things.</v>

1539
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:51.490
<v Speaker 4>And you might say the Washington Post </v>
<v Speaker 4>lies like a dog,</v>

1540
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.820
<v Speaker 4>but we're still talking about the story </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they wrote and,</v>

1541
01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:55.450
<v Speaker 4>and debating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1542
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.180
<v Speaker 4>so when you say things are getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>

1543
01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.730
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1544
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.633
<v Speaker 4>it depends on how you define it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The iphones are certainly better than </v>

1545
01:07:02.441 --> 01:07:03.274
<v Speaker 4>they were in the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guess we're talking about two </v>

1546
01:07:05.141 --> 01:07:06.240
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would say I'm,</v>

1547
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:07.143
<v Speaker 4>I was purely talking about just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rights of the human beings of the </v>

1548
01:07:09.461 --> 01:07:10.294
<v Speaker 4>citizens of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it depends on if you ask folks from </v>

1549
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:19.480
<v Speaker 4>a cultural minorities in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's better because they've been</v>

1550
01:07:19.481 --> 01:07:20.314
<v Speaker 4>progressing at a different pace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you say the rights of Americans </v>

1551
01:07:24.071 --> 01:07:24.904
<v Speaker 4>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the word liberty is a funny </v>

1552
01:07:26.591 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charles Austin Beard said decades ago,</v>

1553
01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:29.974
<v Speaker 4>that all you need do to get a reputation</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a dangerous radical these days is to </v>

1554
01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:36.940
<v Speaker 4>go around spouting the sayings of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>founding fathers.</v>

1555
01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.073
<v Speaker 4>I would say that that the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll get you on a domestic terrorism </v>

1556
01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:41.974
<v Speaker 4>list these days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yet words like liberty used to be </v>

1557
01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:46.780
<v Speaker 4>used in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a real sense.</v>

1558
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:48.100
<v Speaker 4>Now what does liberty mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1559
01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:51.190
<v Speaker 4>you could talk to 20 different people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get 20 different definitions,</v>

1560
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:55.390
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean what it used in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>70s we had this concept,</v>

1561
01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:59.920
<v Speaker 4>and it might not jive with the reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 1970s but the attitude then was that</v>

1562
01:07:59.921 --> 01:08:02.050
<v Speaker 4>they're always going to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1563
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Your rights are going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna have more rights.</v>

1564
01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:04.774
<v Speaker 4>You got all these things and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 1970s in terms of personal freedom </v>

1565
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:10.990
<v Speaker 4>and all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only was it better,</v>

1566
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 4>but the concept in the culture was </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

1567
01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:14.554
<v Speaker 4>I would argue that if you grab a 20 year</v>
<v Speaker 4>old today and then talk about some of </v>

1568
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.990
<v Speaker 4>the things we used to think when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up should be part of your rights</v>

1569
01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:22.670
<v Speaker 4>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you like to live in a country like</v>

1570
01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1571
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.650
<v Speaker 4>A decent number of them are not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

1572
01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:25.700
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1573
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:26.563
<v Speaker 4>So I would even say that the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the kinds of country I would like to </v>

1574
01:08:31.251 --> 01:08:34.780
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike had been bred out of my country.</v>

1575
01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Men because of the changes in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

1576
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>government is much more powerful,</v>

1577
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:41.480
<v Speaker 4>insular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>secretive.</v>

1578
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean the secrecy had government is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disaster.</v>

1579
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:47.360
<v Speaker 4>How do we go for that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We go for it because while we don't have</v>

1580
01:08:47.361 --> 01:08:49.850
<v Speaker 4>a press exposing it and talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>how enrages it is,</v>

1581
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.430
<v Speaker 4>but two because the cultural norms put </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with it,</v>

1582
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:57.260
<v Speaker 4>we are much more scared than we were in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 70s which is part of what,</v>

1583
01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.213
<v Speaker 4>that's another reason the 70s were so </v>
<v Speaker 4>great because we had just exited an era </v>

1584
01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:01.994
<v Speaker 4>where people were as afraid of communism</v>
<v Speaker 4>then is we are a terrorism today and in </v>

1585
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:06.794
<v Speaker 4>the 70s we stopped being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was the beginning of the period </v>

1586
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:11.900
<v Speaker 4>where all of a sudden people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1587
01:09:11.901 --> 01:09:13.580
<v Speaker 4>you know the commies are going to come </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd say,</v>

1588
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:14.893
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>

1589
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:15.913
<v Speaker 4>And yet this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the taking away of the fear was like </v>

1590
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:23.111
<v Speaker 4>dispelling something and after September</v>
<v Speaker 4>11th then remember it started,</v>

1591
01:09:23.241 --> 01:09:24.074
<v Speaker 4>we had World Trade Center bombings in 95</v>
<v Speaker 4>we the omnibus terrorism antiterrorism </v>

1592
01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:29.840
<v Speaker 4>maximum 96 I mean this has been a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people forget those things,</v>

1593
01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:31.910
<v Speaker 4>but nine 11 was a capsize point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.073
<v Speaker 4>We are too afraid to have the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom and liberty that I grew up </v>

1595
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:39.530
<v Speaker 4>expecting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that we were going to have,</v>

1596
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.450
<v Speaker 4>but that every decade it would get </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

1597
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.360
<v Speaker 4>When you say getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how we felt in the 70s.</v>

1598
01:09:44.361 --> 01:09:46.650
<v Speaker 4>And yet I would say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>press freedom is worse.</v>

1599
01:09:46.651 --> 01:09:48.280
<v Speaker 4>Personal freedom is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our,</v>

1600
01:09:48.281 --> 01:09:50.300
<v Speaker 4>our conception of what the government </v>
<v Speaker 4>should do is worse.</v>

1601
01:09:50.301 --> 01:09:51.740
<v Speaker 4>The secrecy is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

1602
01:09:51.741 --> 01:09:55.100
<v Speaker 4>it depends on how you define it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously if you are an African American</v>

1603
01:09:55.101 --> 01:09:55.934
<v Speaker 4>in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think things are better today than </v>

1604
01:09:56.721 --> 01:09:56.910
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>

1605
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:58.030
<v Speaker 4>And then I studied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1606
01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.053
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1607
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:01.730
<v Speaker 4>so depending on where you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your viewpoint is,</v>

1608
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:04.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my argument is from the standards of</v>

1609
01:10:04.161 --> 01:10:04.994
<v Speaker 4>the constitution and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 1970s may have been the high </v>

1610
01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:10.370
<v Speaker 4>watermark of American self image of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things should be.</v>

1611
01:10:10.371 --> 01:10:11.204
<v Speaker 4>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that it went from sort of of real </v>

1612
01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:14.714
<v Speaker 4>personal liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we've come along way and pave the </v>

1613
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:19.870
<v Speaker 4>way you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as you weren't hurting someone.</v>

1614
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.200
<v Speaker 4>So that we've come a nice way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we've lost in the course of that is</v>

1615
01:10:24.201 --> 01:10:27.830
<v Speaker 4>that we've allowed government to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger and spy on us.</v>

1616
01:10:27.831 --> 01:10:28.130
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1617
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.963
<v Speaker 4>and at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch the press kind of crumble around </v>

1618
01:10:31.221 --> 01:10:32.054
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's our do it and there you got to </v>

1619
01:10:34.341 --> 01:10:35.180
<v Speaker 4>look in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1620
01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:36.014
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to call something the Pinocchio </v>

1621
01:10:37.041 --> 01:10:37.874
<v Speaker 4>effect when it comes to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember the Oliver Wendell Holmes had </v>

1622
01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:42.200
<v Speaker 4>defined the limits of liberty on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>court and he said,</v>

1623
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.580
<v Speaker 4>the right to swing your fist ends with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other man's nose begins.</v>

1624
01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:47.853
<v Speaker 4>And I had asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if the other man's nose is </v>

1625
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:51.860
<v Speaker 4>continually growing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1626
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:55.670
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you say you can live the way you want</v>

1627
01:10:55.671 --> 01:10:56.504
<v Speaker 4>until you harm somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if you decide things harm you now </v>

1628
01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:02.900
<v Speaker 4>that didn't harm you before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1629
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.240
<v Speaker 4>if you play your music too loud and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>live next door to you and I can't sleep,</v>

1630
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.373
<v Speaker 4>you're directly impacting me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a direct imposition on my </v>

1631
01:11:12.651 --> 01:11:13.484
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you shouldn't be able to play your </v>

1632
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:17.100
<v Speaker 4>music that loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If on the other hand,</v>

1633
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:18.143
<v Speaker 4>I smoked cigarettes and my insurance </v>
<v Speaker 4>company is going to have to pay for me </v>

1634
01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:24.330
<v Speaker 4>if I get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is going to raise your rates,</v>

1635
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.193
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did I really impact your rights where </v>

1636
01:11:26.851 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 4>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

1637
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:30.600
<v Speaker 4>I can impact your rights because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>costing me money.</v>

1638
01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:31.973
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's the equivalent of the nose </v>

1639
01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:33.804
<v Speaker 4>growing longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I call that wallet rights because it's </v>

1640
01:11:35.161 --> 01:11:38.010
<v Speaker 4>different than a direct inhibition on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your rights.</v>

1641
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 4>It's an indirect one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the problem with that is if you're a</v>

1642
01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:41.694
<v Speaker 4>clever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can connect point a to point B on </v>

1643
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:46.660
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1644
01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you say if it costs you money </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a society is interconnected,</v>

1645
01:11:50.041 --> 01:11:51.510
<v Speaker 4>is ours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you,</v>

1646
01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:52.344
<v Speaker 4>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then Oliver Wendell Holmes is whole </v>

1647
01:11:53.701 --> 01:11:54.534
<v Speaker 4>proposition goes out the window because </v>
<v Speaker 4>then everybody's actions cost you </v>

1648
01:11:57.991 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1649
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.290
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1650
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.010
<v Speaker 4>you can't swing your fist at all.</v>

1651
01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:02.771
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be out there,</v>

1652
01:12:02.771 --> 01:12:04.750
<v Speaker 3>grabbed the cigarettes out of people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>maps,</v>

1653
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.750
<v Speaker 4>become the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once we decided that instead of a direct</v>

1654
01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.613
<v Speaker 4>challenge to your right to live the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>an indirect challenges and imposition </v>

1655
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:13.783
<v Speaker 4>and becomes cause for limiting you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we've destroyed the entire idea </v>

1656
01:12:17.361 --> 01:12:18.194
<v Speaker 4>that you have any personal liberty that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could call your own because </v>

1657
01:12:20.751 --> 01:12:23.150
<v Speaker 4>everything you do impacts at least my </v>
<v Speaker 4>wallet somehow.</v>

1658
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:25.450
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's just quickly before we wrap up,</v>

1659
01:12:25.451 --> 01:12:26.284
<v Speaker 3>go back to the example of the music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I think it's a perfect example of </v>

1660
01:12:28.481 --> 01:12:29.314
<v Speaker 3>where we can talk about government </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrusion and personal rights and all </v>

1661
01:12:31.241 --> 01:12:32.074
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if my next door neighbor was banging </v>

1662
01:12:33.701 --> 01:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>on the piano all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they were playing great,</v>

1663
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:37.900
<v Speaker 3>great classical music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was bothering me,</v>

1664
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I would eventually go next door and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1665
01:12:40.571 --> 01:12:43.150
<v Speaker 3>if you wouldn't mind maybe from these </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>

1666
01:12:43.151 --> 01:12:43.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blah Blah Blah,</v>

1667
01:12:43.961 --> 01:12:44.794
<v Speaker 3>please play impacted my right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying this is my right in my own </v>

1668
01:12:48.641 --> 01:12:51.760
<v Speaker 3>home to be live here peaceably and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not be.</v>

1669
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:52.853
<v Speaker 3>And the older rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't like it if I did it to you </v>

1670
01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.140
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you?</v>

1671
01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:55.973
<v Speaker 3>I would use something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be me expressing my </v>

1672
01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.460
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and then hopefully them hearing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1673
01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Now what a lot of people would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1674
01:13:02.021 --> 01:13:02.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1675
01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.870
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would say maybe you would try that,</v>

1676
01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.560
<v Speaker 3>but if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then what's the next step?</v>

1677
01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you go to your local congressmen or </v>
<v Speaker 3>councilman and say,</v>

1678
01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:12.010
<v Speaker 3>we need some sort of noise law passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1679
01:13:12.011 --> 01:13:16.240
<v Speaker 3>and then all you're doing really is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>expanding the government to then control</v>

1680
01:13:16.241 --> 01:13:18.850
<v Speaker 3>what should be done as an interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1681
01:13:18.851 --> 01:13:21.430
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes you can't win all of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>interpret what is,</v>

1682
01:13:21.490 --> 01:13:23.200
<v Speaker 3>what if the guy just says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well go fuck yourself.</v>

1683
01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:24.243
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That how do you balance liberty and not </v>

1684
01:13:27.491 --> 01:13:28.610
<v Speaker 3>an intrusive government?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1685
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:29.463
<v Speaker 3>this gets back to my views on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on not educating the American populace </v>

1686
01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:35.470
<v Speaker 3>on what their freedoms are and what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>

1687
01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:36.370
<v Speaker 3>We don't do enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1688
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.010
<v Speaker 3>liberty's a bad word now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1689
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at your phone,</v>

1690
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:40.703
<v Speaker 3>new documents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1691
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.180
<v Speaker 3>it's the number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the word liberty.</v>

1692
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:42.611
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1693
01:13:42.611 --> 01:13:43.810
<v Speaker 3>but no one even knows what it means.</v>

1694
01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:44.860
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1695
01:13:44.861 --> 01:13:46.750
<v Speaker 3>I always connected it to the golden </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule.</v>

1696
01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:47.973
<v Speaker 3>The amount of freedom you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give your fellow human being in this </v>

1697
01:13:50.471 --> 01:13:53.230
<v Speaker 3>country is directly proportional to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get.</v>

1698
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:54.910
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1699
01:13:54.911 --> 01:13:56.800
<v Speaker 3>that music really disturbs me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

1700
01:13:56.801 --> 01:13:57.634
<v Speaker 3>The guy enjoys it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to cut him some slack until </v>

1701
01:13:58.841 --> 01:13:59.674
<v Speaker 3>8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM and then I'm going to go to him and </v>

1702
01:14:00.341 --> 01:14:01.210
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey buddy,</v>

1703
01:14:01.211 --> 01:14:02.170
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>After 8:00</v>

1704
01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 3>PM can we cut it off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

1705
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.290
<v Speaker 3>and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1706
01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.710
<v Speaker 3>that's a fantasy way to live because </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings aren't that way.</v>

1707
01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.020
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a golden rule aspect,</v>

1708
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 3>liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you get</v>

1709
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.873
<v Speaker 4>too restrictive of your fellow man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in effect restricting yourself </v>

1710
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.773
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't understand this because we </v>

1711
01:14:18.881 --> 01:14:20.040
<v Speaker 4>don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1712
01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:21.430
<v Speaker 4>if you go look at the founding </v>
<v Speaker 4>documents,</v>

1713
01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:23.730
<v Speaker 4>there are areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right and arrows.</v>

1714
01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.690
<v Speaker 4>Certain things become big in this era.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talk about terrorism a lot and we,</v>

1715
01:14:26.691 --> 01:14:29.400
<v Speaker 4>and we get granular with it and examine </v>
<v Speaker 4>it in,</v>

1716
01:14:29.401 --> 01:14:30.234
<v Speaker 4>in that era.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Liberty was big and all these great </v>

1717
01:14:32.021 --> 01:14:34.000
<v Speaker 4>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the John Locke's and all these people we</v>

1718
01:14:34.001 --> 01:14:34.834
<v Speaker 4>celebrate today that Thomas Paine's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were examining that question from </v>

1719
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.430
<v Speaker 4>and their version,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1720
01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:40.264
<v Speaker 4>what they meant when they said liberty </v>
<v Speaker 4>is different than what even you and I </v>

1721
01:14:42.401 --> 01:14:43.234
<v Speaker 4>are talking about today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had an 18th century political </v>

1722
01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:48.910
<v Speaker 4>concept of what it meant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the 70s,</v>

1723
01:14:48.911 --> 01:14:49.744
<v Speaker 4>to get back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I like to call the high watermark </v>

1724
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:52.203
<v Speaker 4>of our concept of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea of your right to live your </v>

1725
01:14:56.501 --> 01:15:00.070
<v Speaker 4>life the way you see fit was pretty darn</v>
<v Speaker 4>strong.</v>

1726
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:05.430
<v Speaker 4>And that became restricted due to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that people were going too far.</v>

1727
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:10.330
<v Speaker 4>And in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard time with going too far in</v>

1728
01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:14.500
<v Speaker 4>your rights to live your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're not directly in and</v>

1729
01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:18.130
<v Speaker 4>directly not wallet rights directly </v>
<v Speaker 4>impinging on my freedom,</v>

1730
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:19.850
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1731
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:22.990
<v Speaker 4>we are less tolerant as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1732
01:15:22.991 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 4>look at how angry people get at smokers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

1733
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 4>I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if it impacts your health.</v>

1734
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:31.240
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no sense amongst,</v>

1735
01:15:31.241 --> 01:15:34.480
<v Speaker 4>and I don't mean to single out anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we all do this in our own ways,</v>

1736
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:37.380
<v Speaker 4>but to sing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to not understand that,</v>

1737
01:15:37.381 --> 01:15:38.530
<v Speaker 4>that that impacts you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll say,</v>

1738
01:15:38.531 --> 01:15:39.364
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't smoke so I don't care what I do </v>

1739
01:15:40.061 --> 01:15:40.841
<v Speaker 4>to those look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1740
01:15:40.841 --> 01:15:44.560
<v Speaker 4>but it impacts the general idea about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're allowed to do.</v>

1741
01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:46.450
<v Speaker 4>They are doing something illegal.</v>

1742
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:48.630
<v Speaker 4>Well and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you may not like it.</v>

1743
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.190
<v Speaker 4>We all do something that someone doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1744
01:15:51.191 --> 01:15:54.070
<v Speaker 4>And the way we've become these way is </v>
<v Speaker 4>very selfish about our rights.</v>

1745
01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.020
<v Speaker 4>If I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's important.</v>

1746
01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:59.140
<v Speaker 4>If I don't do it and it costs me money </v>
<v Speaker 4>to hell with that.</v>

1747
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.213
<v Speaker 4>There's a general concept though that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>should teach in schools about how </v>

1748
01:16:02.951 --> 01:16:03.784
<v Speaker 4>liberty is a give and take thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and so then what do you do when </v>

1749
01:16:06.671 --> 01:16:08.440
<v Speaker 4>they keep taking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So going back to this guy,</v>

1750
01:16:08.441 --> 01:16:09.274
<v Speaker 4>so now it's eight o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've expressed it kindly and nicely to </v>

1751
01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:12.640
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight o'clock rolls by,</v>

1752
01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:16.640
<v Speaker 4>he's still slash that's the swing my </v>
<v Speaker 4>nose fifth.</v>

1753
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.640
<v Speaker 4>That's when you may need to do have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>noise ordinance.</v>

1754
01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:19.474
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I'm not one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>libertarians who would say you don't </v>

1755
01:16:21.671 --> 01:16:22.504
<v Speaker 4>need government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these things can be handled between </v>

1756
01:16:23.501 --> 01:16:24.334
<v Speaker 4>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No you can't because some people are </v>

1757
01:16:25.691 --> 01:16:27.940
<v Speaker 4>jerks among other things and some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1758
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:30.940
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I was trying to get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>line between.</v>

1759
01:16:30.941 --> 01:16:34.060
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'm not a libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 4>libertarianism in class.</v>

1760
01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.980
<v Speaker 4>We can't take care of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

1761
01:16:35.981 --> 01:16:37.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get to libertarianism,</v>

1762
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:38.134
<v Speaker 4>that's my other problem is that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have as much faith as they do that if </v>

1763
01:16:41.891 --> 01:16:44.500
<v Speaker 4>you took away the supports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shall we say,</v>

1764
01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.470
<v Speaker 4>the people necessarily can take care of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those as I can.</v>

1765
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.270
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1766
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.210
<v Speaker 4>but not only can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not everyone take care of them,</v>

1767
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:52.623
<v Speaker 4>great English,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not only can not everyone take care </v>

1768
01:16:53.711 --> 01:16:54.544
<v Speaker 4>of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are people that do absolutely </v>

1769
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:59.620
<v Speaker 4>vital jobs in our society that are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>profit center things.</v>

1770
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:00.783
<v Speaker 4>And you look at the caretakers who take </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they make nothing and you look at </v>

1771
01:17:03.701 --> 01:17:04.211
<v Speaker 4>them and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1772
01:17:04.211 --> 01:17:06.100
<v Speaker 4>but what are you going to do when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>need a caretaker?</v>

1773
01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.890
<v Speaker 4>Society doesn't allocate resources.</v>

1774
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and never has.</v>

1775
01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:10.881
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

1776
01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:11.714
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about fantasy here in </v>

1777
01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:13.950
<v Speaker 4>theoreticals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1778
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.370
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't allocate resources that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I talk,</v>

1779
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to civil liberties,</v>

1780
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.740
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about how you organize </v>
<v Speaker 4>society,</v>

1781
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.753
<v Speaker 4>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wonder about what I call the </v>

1782
01:17:23.541 --> 01:17:25.220
<v Speaker 4>losers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean that in the terrible,</v>

1783
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.260
<v Speaker 4>but there are winners and there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>losers.</v>

1784
01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:31.040
<v Speaker 4>And if you have too many losers in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>society,</v>

1785
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:35.150
<v Speaker 4>they will destroy your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will make you feel their pain.</v>

1786
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I didn't show once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called,</v>

1787
01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.780
<v Speaker 4>well what called one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the losers?</v>

1788
01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.670
<v Speaker 4>I called the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1789
01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:43.220
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the revenge of the gangrenous finger.</v>

1790
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:44.180
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1791
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.070
<v Speaker 4>if you're a human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1792
01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:45.351
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1793
01:17:45.351 --> 01:17:50.270
<v Speaker 4>if our societies like a human body and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this finger gets disease,</v>

1794
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:52.430
<v Speaker 4>you may say to heck with this finger who</v>
<v Speaker 4>needs it,</v>

1795
01:17:52.431 --> 01:17:53.920
<v Speaker 4>it's a small finger and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to,</v>

1796
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:54.973
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get away with that for a while </v>

1797
01:17:55.761 --> 01:17:59.210
<v Speaker 4>until it gets bad enough and then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>will make you feel it's pain.</v>

1798
01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:01.370
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason the French revolution </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>

1799
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.233
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a balance and a stacy's that </v>

1800
01:18:03.801 --> 01:18:04.634
<v Speaker 4>every society needs and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount it can go before it gets </v>

1801
01:18:06.981 --> 01:18:08.990
<v Speaker 4>out of balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you say,</v>

1802
01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:09.824
<v Speaker 4>I have an ideological template that says</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's every man for himself and enough </v>

1803
01:18:12.831 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 4>people don't make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll get rid of your ideology.</v>

1804
01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'll destroy your society.</v>

1805
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:17.583
<v Speaker 2>So would you basically say the classical</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism is just sort of a more </v>

1806
01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:20.494
<v Speaker 2>realistic version of libertarianism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of where I've come around </v>

1807
01:18:23.650 --> 01:18:24.483
<v Speaker 2>that I would consider myself a classical</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal cause I do cause I'm agreeing </v>

1808
01:18:26.591 --> 01:18:29.590
<v Speaker 2>with you on this that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see some use for the state.</v>

1809
01:18:29.591 --> 01:18:32.950
<v Speaker 2>There are some things that the state has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and I want lower taxes,</v>

1810
01:18:32.951 --> 01:18:34.900
<v Speaker 2>but I understand that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxed.</v>

1811
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.680
<v Speaker 4>Everything is a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1812
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.230
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that because conditions change,</v>

1813
01:18:40.231 --> 01:18:45.231
<v Speaker 4>you have to continually be rebalancing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the likelihood in a system like ours</v>

1814
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:49.920
<v Speaker 4>where your views and my views are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the politics,</v>

1815
01:18:49.921 --> 01:18:50.754
<v Speaker 4>this is where the corruption comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I want to use the word corruption </v>

1816
01:18:53.131 --> 01:18:57.570
<v Speaker 4>because when we talk about campaign </v>
<v Speaker 4>finance reform or something like that,</v>

1817
01:18:57.571 --> 01:19:01.830
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like an issue to be argued.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say corruption,</v>

1818
01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.860
<v Speaker 4>there is no good argument for </v>
<v Speaker 4>corruption.</v>

1819
01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:06.023
<v Speaker 4>And what I always say is every </v>
<v Speaker 4>government is corrupt because you can't </v>

1820
01:19:08.281 --> 01:19:09.720
<v Speaker 4>help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you go look at the,</v>

1821
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:10.583
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the US government actually puts out an </v>

1822
01:19:11.731 --> 01:19:14.070
<v Speaker 4>index of corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not.</v>

1823
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:15.170
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1824
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.033
<v Speaker 4>though at the top countries are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>least corrupt countries and at the </v>

1825
01:19:18.301 --> 01:19:20.450
<v Speaker 4>bottom you get to these kleptocracy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1826
01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.070
<v Speaker 4>So everything's in between.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1827
01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:26.010
<v Speaker 4>even the most clean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well run.</v>

1828
01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:26.843
<v Speaker 4>Governments have some level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>corruption and every government can </v>

1829
01:19:29.551 --> 01:19:31.230
<v Speaker 4>function with a certain amount,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1830
01:19:31.231 --> 01:19:33.780
<v Speaker 4>But there's a tipping point somewhere on</v>
<v Speaker 4>that scale.</v>

1831
01:19:33.781 --> 01:19:35.790
<v Speaker 4>You get to a number where it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>work anymore,</v>

1832
01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:36.803
<v Speaker 4>where everyone has to be bribed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The United States used to rank at a </v>

1833
01:19:39.811 --> 01:19:40.644
<v Speaker 4>level much higher than we rank now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At what point do you get to a place </v>

1834
01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.680
<v Speaker 4>where it doesn't matter what Dave Ruben </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants her,</v>

1835
01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:48.510
<v Speaker 4>Dan Carlin wants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get what you want.</v>

1836
01:19:48.511 --> 01:19:50.190
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these politicians,</v>

1837
01:19:50.191 --> 01:19:51.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the real flaw in our system is,</v>

1838
01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.420
<v Speaker 4>is a politician can promise anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want.</v>

1839
01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:55.973
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing that holds them to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have more protection than a </v>

1840
01:19:58.291 --> 01:19:59.124
<v Speaker 4>handshake relationship with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>gardener than you do with a person </v>

1841
01:20:01.711 --> 01:20:04.830
<v Speaker 4>running for president because they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>into office and change their minds.</v>

1842
01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.720
<v Speaker 4>The only reason you voted for them is </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they told you.</v>

1843
01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.730
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they don't do it well,</v>

1844
01:20:08.731 --> 01:20:09.181
<v Speaker 4>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1845
01:20:09.181 --> 01:20:10.014
<v Speaker 4>I won't vote for them in four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in four years you get to a </v>

1846
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:16.230
<v Speaker 4>place where it's them against another </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you hate them both.</v>

1847
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:17.010
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what are you going,</v>

1848
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:19.650
<v Speaker 4>but that's where the two parties kill us</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they put people,</v>

1849
01:20:19.651 --> 01:20:22.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean this and this election is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best example you'll ever see.</v>

1850
01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:24.023
<v Speaker 4>How many people held their nose </v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless of who they voted for and </v>

1851
01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:27.684
<v Speaker 4>voted for someone they didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they really couldn't stand the </v>

1852
01:20:29.851 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 4>other guy even more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or the other gal even more.</v>

1853
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.813
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who said that they get to pick your </v>

1854
01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:36.370
<v Speaker 4>choices and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1855
01:20:36.371 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 4>you had a whole primary process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1856
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:38.574
<v Speaker 4>but who got to be in the debates?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And who decided that a commission made </v>

1857
01:20:40.951 --> 01:20:42.810
<v Speaker 4>up of half Democrats and half </v>
<v Speaker 4>Republicans?</v>

1858
01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.713
<v Speaker 2>How is it that we let the Democrats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans decide that the third party </v>

1859
01:20:46.121 --> 01:20:50.630
<v Speaker 2>could only get in at 15% nationally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We let the other two parties we get back</v>

1860
01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.420
<v Speaker 4>down at the level we let them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we let them,</v>

1861
01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:55.910
<v Speaker 4>and this is um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1862
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:59.200
<v Speaker 4>I said it on and people hate when I do </v>
<v Speaker 4>this about looking at the bright side of</v>

1863
01:20:59.201 --> 01:21:00.034
<v Speaker 4>some of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1864
01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:00.973
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes you don't get the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>reforms in government until somebody </v>

1865
01:21:05.601 --> 01:21:06.434
<v Speaker 4>crosses a line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was Watergate a good thing for the </v>

1866
01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:09.820
<v Speaker 4>country or the bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1867
01:21:09.821 --> 01:21:12.620
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when president Gerald Ford forgave,</v>

1868
01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.800
<v Speaker 4>pardoned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1869
01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:14.983
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy Nixon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said our long national nightmare is </v>

1870
01:21:17.451 --> 01:21:18.284
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we got reforms after that that are </v>

1871
01:21:21.081 --> 01:21:24.620
<v Speaker 4>the best reforms we've had in 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was Watergate worth it.</v>

1872
01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:25.880
<v Speaker 4>So you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1873
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:30.350
<v Speaker 4>if you have to fall off the ledge for us</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fix something in this system,</v>

1874
01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.780
<v Speaker 4>should we fall off the ledge?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1875
01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.960
<v Speaker 4>Only if it gets fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1876
01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.640
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about a constitutional crisis.</v>

1877
01:21:37.641 --> 01:21:39.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a great thing if afterwards you </v>
<v Speaker 4>solve things,</v>

1878
01:21:39.651 --> 01:21:41.180
<v Speaker 4>it's a bad thing if you lose.</v>

1879
01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:44.060
<v Speaker 4>And so that's that with Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can sit there and go,</v>

1880
01:21:44.061 --> 01:21:44.894
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when they talk about a </v>

1881
01:21:45.861 --> 01:21:46.694
<v Speaker 4>constitutional crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just hearing the word constitution </v>

1882
01:21:48.201 --> 01:21:49.370
<v Speaker 4>sounds like a reform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1883
01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:51.500
<v Speaker 4>But talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what if you lose?</v>

1884
01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:53.090
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so in that sense,</v>

1885
01:21:53.091 --> 01:21:56.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm torn between if you had elected </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton,</v>

1886
01:21:56.091 --> 01:21:58.130
<v Speaker 4>all those people that are upset with dot</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Donald Trump,</v>

1887
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:59.143
<v Speaker 4>you would have gotten more of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would suggest it's 50 to 60 years </v>

1888
01:22:03.021 --> 01:22:05.870
<v Speaker 4>of slouching towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconstitutionality.</v>

1889
01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:06.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

1890
01:22:06.801 --> 01:22:07.634
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump looks like chemotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could kill us faster or he could be </v>

1891
01:22:12.351 --> 01:22:15.230
<v Speaker 4>something that prompts the equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 4>democratic.</v>

1892
01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:18.670
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a Ma Democratic anti bodies.</v>

1893
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:23.930
<v Speaker 4>He reminds us why authoritarianism is </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous and what could happen.</v>

1894
01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:25.910
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people who don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about politics at all.</v>

1895
01:22:25.911 --> 01:22:26.900
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have lives,</v>

1896
01:22:26.901 --> 01:22:28.930
<v Speaker 4>we have things in our own life that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to focus on.</v>

1897
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:29.783
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want your country to run on </v>

1898
01:22:30.711 --> 01:22:33.680
<v Speaker 4>autopilot and you want it to run well on</v>
<v Speaker 4>autopilot.</v>

1899
01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.820
<v Speaker 4>But in a system of representative </v>
<v Speaker 4>democracy,</v>

1900
01:22:35.821 --> 01:22:38.120
<v Speaker 4>if the people don't flex their muscles </v>
<v Speaker 4>long enough,</v>

1901
01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:43.150
<v Speaker 4>things get wiggy been 40 or 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>since we've gone out there with our feet</v>

1902
01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.540
<v Speaker 4>and told government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1903
01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:46.490
<v Speaker 4>you can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it takes,</v>

1904
01:22:46.491 --> 01:22:47.324
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they talk about a women's protest with </v>

1905
01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:50.840
<v Speaker 4>millions of people and that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't work.</v>

1906
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:52.550
<v Speaker 4>It has to be protest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1907
01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.730
<v Speaker 4>you have to maintain it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen.</v>

1908
01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:56.653
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could lose and if we lose then you </v>

1909
01:22:59.631 --> 01:23:00.800
<v Speaker 4>have to have a plan b country.</v>

1910
01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of Pan Be,</v>

1911
01:23:02.681 --> 01:23:03.514
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to have to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>again to get to some of plan b stuff </v>

1912
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:07.460
<v Speaker 2>because I always say it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview,</v>

1913
01:23:07.461 --> 01:23:09.790
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have to look down once and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

1914
01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:12.280
<v Speaker 2>And I let you talk David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like give me any time at all.</v>

1915
01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Anybody space nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you took a bit.</v>

1916
01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 2>This was really a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what it's all about.</v>

1917
01:23:17.351 --> 01:23:18.184
<v Speaker 2>This is what I've tried to bring to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience is let's really figure some of </v>

1918
01:23:21.161 --> 01:23:22.670
<v Speaker 2>this stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not pretend we,</v>

1919
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:23.623
<v Speaker 2>we know things that we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's figure out how we're supposed </v>

1920
01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:29.590
<v Speaker 2>to be governed and how to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past so we can figure out the future.</v>

1921
01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:31.510
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what I like to do.</v>

1922
01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:32.363
<v Speaker 2>So thank you for coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to stick around and do a </v>

1923
01:23:33.881 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 2>little rapid fire for our patron people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for more on Dan,</v>

<v Speaker 2>history at Dan Carlin Daca.</v>
