1
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today as a professor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>English at the University of Ottawa and </v>

2
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.301
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a self declared anti feminist and a </v>

3
00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:14.770
<v Speaker 1>campaigner for the right to dissent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Janice,</v>

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>be mango.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report.</v>

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave.</v>

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.840
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were looped in by this Jordan </v>

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Peterson Fella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently everyone knows this guy now.</v>

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>So before we do anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it would be interesting since </v>

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.961
<v Speaker 1>he looped us in together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of the Jordan Peterson </v>

10
00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:34.961
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon?</v>

11
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

12
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say the very least,</v>

13
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:43.451
<v Speaker 2>I think what Jordan proves is that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an incredible hunger out there </v>

14
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 2>amongst young people maybe amongst young</v>
<v Speaker 2>men in particular,</v>

15
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously amongst women as well for,</v>

16
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 2>for something that's really genuine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard hitting and real in terms of </v>

18
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 2>discussing what matters in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that we aren't getting in our </v>

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 2>public conversations at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

21
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:13.901
<v Speaker 2>and Jordan obviously offers that and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of the attempts to discredit him</v>

22
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 2>and to claim that he represents </v>
<v Speaker 2>something really dark and nefarious.</v>

23
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it clearly isn't working.</v>

24
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 2>And turning people off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ain't going to stop though.</v>

25
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

26
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just ramping up,</v>

27
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

28
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>What is going on in Canada that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be a burst of Canadian </v>

30
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>professors from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Jordan to you and God says,</v>

31
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>and plenty of others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>feel free to name drop some others that </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be on my radar.</v>

33
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be a real pushback from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian professors,</v>

34
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>at least a small select group of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>against this sort of group think and pro</v>

35
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>photo diversity and whatever you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>call this whole move.</v>

36
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

37
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:03.651
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's unfortunately still a </v>

38
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 2>relatively small group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

39
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 2>I think there needs to be a lot more in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way of pushback.</v>

40
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 2>The thing that really struck me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson situation when he first </v>

41
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 2>sort of burst onto the scene with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>declaration that he would not,</v>

42
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

43
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would not engage in forced to speech,</v>

44
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

45
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 2>that not a single professor at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto would come forward</v>

46
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 2>even to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may not necessarily agree with what </v>

47
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 2>he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I support his right to say it,</v>

48
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the largest </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>

49
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 2>if not the largest university in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>and probably the most prestigious one.</v>

50
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that not a single professor</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt that he or she could stand with </v>

51
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Jordan in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was astounding to me.</v>

52
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a few.</v>

54
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 2>And Gad sad is a wonderful example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a close friend at,</v>

55
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:03.351
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acadia university who was actually just </v>

56
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 2>fired this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick Mehta,</v>

57
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>who was inspired by Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

58
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>he was someone who had been thinking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>years a lot of the things that Jordan </v>

59
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>has talked about in terms of the group </v>
<v Speaker 2>think in academia,</v>

60
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 2>the whole range of subjects that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>even talk about,</v>

61
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't talk about from a variety</v>

62
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>of positions that you have to take one </v>
<v Speaker 2>position on a.</v>

63
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>and so he finally started speaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before this,</v>

64
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>he was an award winning teacher and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year he started speaking out,</v>

65
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 2>he had so many complaints and he's now </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually been fired.</v>

66
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>A tenured professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an astounding thing.</v>

67
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

68
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>so unfortunately I would say that what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in Canada is that a few people</v>

69
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 2>are speaking out and a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking privately,</v>

70
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I really support what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and I really wish I could do it as</v>

72
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:57.181
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's way too dangerous for me to do </v>

73
00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:00.211
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the case of Professor Mehta at </v>

74
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Acadia proves that indeed people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to be very fearful.</v>

75
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

76
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Professor Metta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting to me that one of </v>

77
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.341
<v Speaker 1>the ways I get guests is that suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone does something often at a </v>

78
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.330
<v Speaker 1>university and then it starts bubbling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some stories,</v>

79
00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:19.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started hearing about it on </v>

80
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:21.191
<v Speaker 1>twitter and then it bubbles up enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they usually end up right in </v>

81
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:24.821
<v Speaker 1>that seat where you are right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect he'll probably be adhere </v>

82
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:24.821
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a weird way,</v>

83
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:29.501
<v Speaker 1>all of you guys are just defending the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to think about these issues.</v>

84
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>The positions that most of you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking off and wouldn't have been </v>

85
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>considered radical 20 years.</v>

86
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

87
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have been.</v>

88
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.650
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in,</v>

89
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.670
<v Speaker 2>in Professor Metta is case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me he's such an excellent </v>

90
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 2>example of the fact that this is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>about even an,</v>

91
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:51.960
<v Speaker 2>an individual saying offensive things </v>
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

92
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.690
<v Speaker 1>what were the supposedly defensive</v>

93
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.660
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

94
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.930
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't take these as positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

96
00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:03.741
<v Speaker 2>I think would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would identify himself as a classic </v>

97
00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not particularly conservative,</v>

98
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.660
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to talk about the full range </v>

99
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.730
<v Speaker 2>of issues he objected to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities indigenization program,</v>

100
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:19.290
<v Speaker 2>which I think maybe was the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial of the subjects.</v>

101
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is probably now the top hot</v>

102
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:26.910
<v Speaker 2>button issue at Canadian universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

103
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

104
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.340
<v Speaker 2>the move to replace European based </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge as exclusionary and inadequate</v>

105
00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:41.511
<v Speaker 2>and subjective and to replace it in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases with indigenous knowledge.</v>

106
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even in something called indigenous </v>

107
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.271
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which many scientists would say is </v>

108
00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:53.541
<v Speaker 2>actually not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is only there science that </v>

109
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:53.820
<v Speaker 2>is all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

110
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 2>and so indigenous science has to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

111
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous ways of knowing elders' </v>

112
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.621
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What some might say is superstition or </v>

113
00:06:05.621 --> 00:06:09.761
<v Speaker 2>magical beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of anecdotal kinds of observations </v>

114
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.920
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an attempt on the part of </v>

115
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.381
<v Speaker 2>universities in some ways a lot of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring in indigenous peoples who've </v>

116
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:21.720
<v Speaker 2>been excluded from the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience for many years for a variety </v>

117
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>of reasons.</v>

118
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

119
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.500
<v Speaker 2>the idea that indigenous knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to be questioned that it has a value</v>

120
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.850
<v Speaker 2>equal to supposedly European science is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a really incredibly worrisome and </v>

121
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>strange idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he objected to that and he raised</v>

122
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 2>a whole bunch of other questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even saying that he wanted to,</v>

123
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 2>that he was necessarily taking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position on them,</v>

124
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 2>but merely saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:54.611
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that identity politics is </v>

126
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 2>divisive and causes resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would've thought,</v>

127
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.950
<v Speaker 2>believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never heard that before.</v>

128
00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

129
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 2>he talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

130
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

131
00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:06.801
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychological science about </v>

132
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.191
<v Speaker 2>differences in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in preference and interest and </v>

133
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 2>intellectual ability between men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

134
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

135
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.520
<v Speaker 2>what else did he talked about the wage </v>
<v Speaker 2>gap and said that there was a lot of </v>

136
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.150
<v Speaker 2>evidence to suggest that it was based on</v>
<v Speaker 2>preferences and choices that people made</v>

137
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.830
<v Speaker 2>rather than bias against women and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of.</v>

138
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 2>And he really was just trying to do what</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly as you said professors once </v>

139
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:35.110
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to do and that's now no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer possible in,</v>

140
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.140
<v Speaker 2>in the university classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of students probably </v>

141
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.020
<v Speaker 2>liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he got these teaching awards and </v>

142
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 2>he had a lot of support even up until </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point that he was fired.</v>

143
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:50.291
<v Speaker 2>But because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a condray of very angry students and </v>

144
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:56.351
<v Speaker 2>also very angry colleagues and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>often professors who are persecuting </v>

145
00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:01.091
<v Speaker 2>other professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They claimed the complained about him </v>

146
00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 2>and said that he was harassing them.</v>

147
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So let's put the student part aside for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a second because we're going to get to </v>

148
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>that a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the colleague,</v>

149
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.370
<v Speaker 1>the fact that so much of this is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven by other professors.</v>

150
00:08:11.371 --> 00:08:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean we saw this with Bret Weinstein </v>
<v Speaker 1>at evergreen state.</v>

151
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Jordan and many of my other friends who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are professors now tell me,</v>

152
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.710
<v Speaker 1>they often get support privately from </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors but not publicly,</v>

153
00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.470
<v Speaker 1>which is the most enraging God tells me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this all the time.</v>

154
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.500
<v Speaker 1>But what do you make of professors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

155
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.850
<v Speaker 1>that are leading this charge against </v>
<v Speaker 1>inquiry?</v>

156
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're true believers.</v>

157
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 2>I think many of them and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

158
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.190
<v Speaker 2>some are true believers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

159
00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:42.120
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

160
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.800
<v Speaker 2>they see themselves as part of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution that's absolutely necessary.</v>

161
00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:51.801
<v Speaker 2>They believe that our society is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrenched inequality and structural </v>

162
00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 2>violence against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against racial minorities,</v>

163
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 2>against indigenous peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against trans people.</v>

164
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

165
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

166
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the claims and uh,</v>

167
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:10.101
<v Speaker 2>and so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see that any attempt to argue or </v>

168
00:09:10.101 --> 00:09:14.901
<v Speaker 2>against their positions or to simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>call for more open discussion is a way </v>

169
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 2>of reasserting of very unjust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would say,</v>

170
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deathly status quo.</v>

171
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.570
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of people I think are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>true believers but are just going along </v>

172
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 2>for career reasons or because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to go along.</v>

173
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 2>They just want to do their research and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can only do it in peace if they say</v>

174
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 2>all the correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.990
<v Speaker 2>platitudes.</v>

176
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

177
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 2>what happened was that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>gradually,</v>

178
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the university was destroyed</v>

179
00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 2>it whenever it started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it happened.</v>

180
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:53.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to have started sometimes in </v>

181
00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:53.241
<v Speaker 2>the late sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allan Bloom,</v>

182
00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've read the closing of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American mind,</v>

183
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

184
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:59.781
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his claim is that professors lost faith </v>

185
00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:04.670
<v Speaker 2>in the idea of the university as a sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of separate space where you simply </v>

186
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>thought about things you didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

187
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a wonderful line.</v>

188
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I remember something about how socrates </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt that it was more important to think</v>

189
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:19.131
<v Speaker 2>about justice and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to really learn what justice is rather </v>

190
00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:22.220
<v Speaker 2>than try to implement whatever partial </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of it,</v>

191
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as roiling the public consciousness of </v>

192
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.230
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

193
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.990
<v Speaker 2>and so that was what the university had </v>
<v Speaker 2>meant at its best,</v>

194
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

195
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And this is a case of where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university original mission of being a </v>

196
00:10:37.961 --> 00:10:42.961
<v Speaker 1>place to find truth and giving people </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to think about these </v>

197
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:42.961
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate these issues,</v>

198
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:47.341
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has taken a complete one 80 because now </v>

199
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:48.790
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be the breeding ground for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of those ideas.</v>

200
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.740
<v Speaker 2>It is a breeding ground for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

201
00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:51.730
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wHere,</v>

202
00:10:51.731 --> 00:10:55.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the indoctrination takes place.</v>

203
00:10:55.361 --> 00:11:00.361
<v Speaker 2>And then of course the students who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>indoctrinated go out into all the major </v>

204
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 2>spheres of our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

205
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.070
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go to law school where they,</v>

206
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.820
<v Speaker 2>they read critical legal theory that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells them that they're there is,</v>

207
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing unbiased or objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the legal system that we have in </v>

208
00:11:15.671 --> 00:11:18.340
<v Speaker 2>north America that it needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely remade.</v>

209
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

210
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 2>they become journalists and they go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism school where they learn the </v>

211
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.491
<v Speaker 2>same thing and they're told that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist should be somebody who </v>

212
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:32.611
<v Speaker 2>attempts to improve and change society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it better rather than just report </v>

213
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.710
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening.</v>

215
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.420
<v Speaker 2>They become teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

216
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.710
<v Speaker 2>they go into the education faculties </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're also being radicalized and</v>

217
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's not surprising that this is </v>

218
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 2>where we're at now.</v>

219
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.110
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that fascinates me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

220
00:11:48.111 --> 00:11:53.111
<v Speaker 1>every time I hear another professor come</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and talk about it or I just see </v>

221
00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:56.111
<v Speaker 1>another breaking story about it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another monument taken down or whatever </v>

222
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ratio of history,</v>

223
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>is that what you said before about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the indigenous sciences.</v>

224
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't want you to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

225
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:08.131
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can have an extra course in </v>

226
00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:10.610
<v Speaker 1>this and teach it hopefully with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same academic rigor as you would teach a</v>

227
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>european scientists or what's known as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

228
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 1>as science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could have a,</v>

229
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 1>a parallel course if you want to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well,</v>

230
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.130
<v Speaker 1>but they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to replace history in that.</v>

231
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous part of this.</v>

232
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

233
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Well and it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not surprising if you believe </v>

234
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.060
<v Speaker 2>that the system that we have now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

235
00:12:32.061 --> 00:12:33.800
<v Speaker 2>kills people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always.</v>

236
00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:35.750
<v Speaker 2>The rhetoric is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really extreme.</v>

237
00:12:35.751 --> 00:12:36.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:12:36.201 --> 00:12:40.340
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is violence to me and my family,</v>

239
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.660
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

240
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 2>causes people to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you really believe that in some </v>

241
00:12:47.001 --> 00:12:49.280
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can't just bring in,</v>

242
00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:51.950
<v Speaker 2>you can't just have add ons of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>courses.</v>

243
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 2>It is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a referral for the witches.</v>

244
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

245
00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 2>It's this and it's not a reform movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>even where you could get to a point </v>

246
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.400
<v Speaker 2>where you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

247
00:13:01.401 --> 00:13:02.370
<v Speaker 2>we've made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

248
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 2>certain structural changes to satisfy </v>
<v Speaker 2>these various concerns.</v>

249
00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:11.600
<v Speaker 2>It is a radical revolutionary movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

250
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything has to be smashed and rebuilt</v>

251
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah.</v>

252
00:13:17.211 --> 00:13:18.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think um,</v>

253
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very naive confidence on the part of </v>

254
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 2>many professors that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they know better than generations </v>

255
00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:34.091
<v Speaker 2>and generations of people who came </v>
<v Speaker 2>before and then they will be able to </v>

256
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:34.880
<v Speaker 2>build jerusalem.</v>

257
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I somehow somehow doubted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

258
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.530
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's back up a little bit and again,</v>

259
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.010
<v Speaker 1>get to your involvement at all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a self declared antI feminists,</v>

260
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.000
<v Speaker 1>the defender of descent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of descent.</v>

261
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So just tell me a little bit about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic background and what sort of </v>

262
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.930
<v Speaker 1>brought you to believe some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you believe now.</v>

263
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

264
00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:57.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

265
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I started off as I think a pretty well </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go back further.</v>

266
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.070
<v Speaker 2>I started off as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as just a,</v>

267
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who loved literature.</v>

268
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I was a nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love to read and that was all I know </v>

269
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.180
<v Speaker 2>from the time I was very young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be a university professor.</v>

270
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:20.181
<v Speaker 2>I want to teach literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I got into graduate school and I</v>

271
00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:23.670
<v Speaker 2>was radicalized there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

272
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everyone,</v>

273
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

274
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.510
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

275
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that experience was really important</v>

276
00:14:29.881 --> 00:14:34.881
<v Speaker 2>to me and that I realized how incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasurable it is to be a radical.</v>

277
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Describe that a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling because it's,</v>

278
00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

279
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:45.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a very addictive and maybe it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>even a kind of addiction.</v>

280
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:50.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that there are all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical changes that go on in your </v>

281
00:14:50.901 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>brain when you're feeling this.</v>

282
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a combination of sort of euphoric </v>
<v Speaker 2>rage and I'm self righteous indignation </v>

283
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

284
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

285
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>righteous outrage and uh,</v>

286
00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:06.580
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

287
00:15:06.581 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did all the things.</v>

288
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I marched in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take back the night marches and I worked</v>

289
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:16.391
<v Speaker 2>at a women's shelter and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then suddenly then I started to see </v>

290
00:15:16.391 --> 00:15:20.381
<v Speaker 2>that my purpose in a becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university professor would be to </v>

291
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.500
<v Speaker 2>radicalize other students and to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>them what I had come to understand.</v>

292
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

293
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:29.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

294
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:34.961
<v Speaker 2>it's a very heady experience and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought for years and years like when I </v>

295
00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>came off it because I think partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of my background,</v>

296
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:40.360
<v Speaker 2>my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

297
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 2>are lower middle class and my dad died </v>
<v Speaker 2>last year.</v>

298
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:45.330
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

299
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.520
<v Speaker 2>somehow the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that outrage,</v>

300
00:15:49.521 --> 00:15:54.521
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't fit with the values that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd given me and it,</v>

301
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

302
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't hold on to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conviction.</v>

303
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:05.020
<v Speaker 2>How long did it last for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lasted while I was a graduate </v>

304
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.020
<v Speaker 2>student.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

305
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.681
<v Speaker 2>So like from about 1991 to 94 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something around there.</v>

306
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And then it started to fade off because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just started.</v>

307
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember moments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there a seminal moment?</v>

308
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't one moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say,</v>

309
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were just,</v>

310
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 2>there were a number of moments where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

311
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't hold on to the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conviction.</v>

312
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of a specific moment until</v>

313
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time I started teaching full </v>

314
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:34.700
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started teaching full time in 1999.</v>

315
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 2>And at that point I would've said that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

316
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably would've said I was still a </v>

317
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:43.780
<v Speaker 2>feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

318
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I would have seen myself as more of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate feminist and,</v>

319
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wouldn't,</v>

320
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't have been my primary self </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification.</v>

321
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I would have said I was an animal lover </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something else like that.</v>

322
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nine slash 11 was really my,</v>

323
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.940
<v Speaker 2>that was my moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was because at the university </v>

324
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 2>that I was teaching at at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>university of saskatchewan,</v>

325
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget that morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

326
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:14.591
<v Speaker 2>I was already at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The secretary said that know planes had </v>

327
00:17:14.591 --> 00:17:18.671
<v Speaker 2>flown into the towers and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrified.</v>

328
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.020
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

329
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:25.090
<v Speaker 2>but I noticed that the mood at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and in my department in </v>

330
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:30.410
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one of like barely contained sort</v>

331
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:35.411
<v Speaker 2>of haunting pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe it.</v>

332
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least,</v>

333
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:42.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe that's maybe not everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt that that could have been just my,</v>

334
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sense of it,</v>

335
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:49.121
<v Speaker 2>but certainly a kind of satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact one of my friends came into </v>

336
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 2>the mail room and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

337
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 2>they've got what they deserved.</v>

338
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 2>within an hour of the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another said that she was going to teach</v>

340
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 2>about it that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was like really early on in the</v>

341
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:04.620
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she hadn't even really started.</v>

342
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I think this was be like our first week </v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe the first part of the second </v>

343
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway.</v>

344
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:16.371
<v Speaker 2>And she was going to teach about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>event and she was going to talk about </v>

345
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.400
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this would be used by reaction,</v>

346
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.450
<v Speaker 2>how this would likely be used by </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactionary forces in the United States.</v>

347
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:29.451
<v Speaker 2>And how it would be very interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch over the next few days who they </v>

348
00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:30.980
<v Speaker 2>would blame and how they would begin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate.</v>

349
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

350
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Like it hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

351
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

352
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.980
<v Speaker 2>she never even thought that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be students in the class who </v>

353
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Speaker 2>would be really upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might even,</v>

354
00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:45.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who knew somebody or it was </v>

355
00:18:45.561 --> 00:18:48.561
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lack of human empathy and the,</v>

356
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 2>the hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the satisfied hatred.</v>

357
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 2>That was really my moment that turned me</v>
<v Speaker 2>off completely.</v>

358
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>

359
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.400
<v Speaker 2>everything to do with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>

360
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:02.690
<v Speaker 2>the progressivism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anti american ism,</v>

361
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.520
<v Speaker 2>the anti western culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

362
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Then the other thing that was happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>

363
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>role in the year before too,</v>

364
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:13.690
<v Speaker 2>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

365
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.830
<v Speaker 2>my department was doing a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hiring and we were doing what we called </v>

366
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 2>equity hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affirmative action hiring and um,</v>

367
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:30.051
<v Speaker 2>we were very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very keen to hire more women and to </v>

368
00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:30.200
<v Speaker 2>hire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

369
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.230
<v Speaker 2>members of visible minorities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people.</v>

370
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jusT,</v>

371
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there,</v>

372
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:42.540
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't allowed to obviously object </v>

373
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.080
<v Speaker 2>in any way and nobody did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>

374
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 2>a set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe occasionally privately,</v>

375
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 2>a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of demoro,</v>

376
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically everyone was publicly very</v>

377
00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:56.031
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic and it just struck me as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most unjust,</v>

378
00:19:56.731 --> 00:20:01.110
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm basically like no men,</v>

379
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.380
<v Speaker 2>no white men were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were even considered for any of the </v>

380
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.280
<v Speaker 2>positions that were offered.</v>

381
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

382
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't see how that was a good thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any way at all.</v>

383
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:22.251
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me outraging and the all </v>

384
00:20:22.251 --> 00:20:25.641
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would get hundreds of applications </v>

385
00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:28.611
<v Speaker 2>for some of the positions and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these men who had done all these amazing</v>

386
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:33.711
<v Speaker 2>things being just being put aside and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women who had done far,</v>

387
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:40.190
<v Speaker 2>far less being considered and brought in</v>
<v Speaker 2>for interview.</v>

388
00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:43.290
<v Speaker 2>And always the idea was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

389
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 2>this was equity hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which meant that if two candidates were </v>

390
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.201
<v Speaker 2>equally qualified and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would choose the woman.</v>

391
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:57.931
<v Speaker 2>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you're looking to hire for </v>

392
00:20:57.931 --> 00:21:01.440
<v Speaker 2>political reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not considering the true </v>

393
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 2>qualities of the candidates at all.</v>

394
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.340
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a situation like this,</v>

395
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:10.270
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had two candidates that had the </v>

396
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 1>exact same criteria and you had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>department that was,</v>

397
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:16.651
<v Speaker 1>say 90 percent male in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would your position be?</v>

398
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.610
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

399
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.800
<v Speaker 2>I never get to that place where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what the proposition a.</v>

400
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

401
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.820
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are never two candidates who are </v>

402
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.951
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same and I honestly could </v>
<v Speaker 2>never see a situation where it would be </v>

403
00:21:31.951 --> 00:21:34.410
<v Speaker 2>so urgent that you would hire on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis of a,</v>

404
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an identity category.</v>

405
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 2>And I can't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

406
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 2>the arguments for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

407
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.460
<v Speaker 2>changing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

408
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.780
<v Speaker 2>the demographic mix of workplaces or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

409
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I can see them applying in very narrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>

410
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in primary school I would say yeah,</v>

411
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.500
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a good idea that children </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a mix of men and women and as </v>

412
00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:10.561
<v Speaker 2>teachers and maybe even an ethnic mix if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ethnically mixed school,</v>

413
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I could see that as important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

414
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:17.560
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't happen because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

416
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 2>primary schools are taught almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely by,</v>

417
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.650
<v Speaker 2>by women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

418
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.660
<v Speaker 2>so little boys who might not have a dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>at home are not even getting a chance to</v>

419
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 2>have a male role model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male role model at primary school.</v>

420
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 2>So that would be a place where I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe see the case for it,</v>

421
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:42.800
<v Speaker 2>but at a university I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really can't see the necessity I do.</v>

422
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that any promising young</v>
<v Speaker 2>person is actually going to be turned </v>

423
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:55.351
<v Speaker 2>off a subject because they don't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who looks exactly like them </v>

424
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 2>reflected in the professoriate.</v>

425
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:03.210
<v Speaker 1>And if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what a deeply profound a </v>

426
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.150
<v Speaker 1>disturbance has already happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>education system.</v>

427
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

428
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just,</v>

429
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that our system is,</v>

430
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 2>is so exclusionary and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

431
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean we hear this so much about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

432
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:18.840
<v Speaker 2>especially women in stem and also I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess um,</v>

433
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial minorities.</v>

434
00:23:20.971 --> 00:23:23.130
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hear more about women need,</v>

435
00:23:23.131 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

436
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.660
<v Speaker 2>they just can't go into astronomy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because supposedly there aren't enough </v>

437
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.920
<v Speaker 2>female astronomers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine who actually left </v>

438
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was working as an astrophysicist in </v>

439
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.531
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He left there and went to China because </v>

440
00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:43.050
<v Speaker 2>he realized that there was no future for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him at all.</v>

441
00:23:43.051 --> 00:23:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

442
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't possibly get a tenure track </v>
<v Speaker 2>position because they were so set on </v>

443
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.020
<v Speaker 2>hiring women or other identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

444
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always sends me things.</v>

445
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:59.081
<v Speaker 2>And recently he sent me something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a phd student was being brought in to </v>

446
00:23:59.081 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 2>talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

447
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I think his old department,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

448
00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad I'm not there anymore.</v>

449
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

450
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 2>and she was going to be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

451
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:14.651
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are not enough women represented </v>

453
00:24:14.651 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 2>in astronomy because even like the laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>are named after,</v>

454
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 2>they're all named after men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's like newton's law,</v>

455
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

456
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the idea that some of these</v>

457
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 2>laws should actually be named after </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else,</v>

458
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 2>even though they're named after the men </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the men,</v>

459
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 2>obviously we're the ones that discovered</v>
<v Speaker 2>the laws,</v>

460
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:35.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

461
00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:40.481
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ludicrous to make their own </v>

462
00:24:40.481 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 2>discoveries exactly for themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless.</v>

463
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 2>But they couldn't because they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

464
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so beaten down by the oppressive </v>

465
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:48.980
<v Speaker 2>maleness of the discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>

466
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:50.750
<v Speaker 2>it isn't true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true.</v>

467
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see if,</v>

468
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.770
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.020
<v Speaker 2>male professors were standing up telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>these female students up,</v>

470
00:24:57.021 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

471
00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:00.080
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that right brain for it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

472
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Well that would be temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody is doing that.</v>

473
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

474
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 2>professors are delighted to have anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's promising and capable male or </v>

475
00:25:10.731 --> 00:25:15.731
<v Speaker 2>female or whatever color their skin is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just isn't the case that there are </v>

476
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:16.500
<v Speaker 2>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 2>systemic barriers to participation.</v>

478
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you had these two experiences,</v>

479
00:25:23.771 --> 00:25:28.771
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nine slash 11 and then the hiring </v>

480
00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:28.771
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I find often,</v>

481
00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:33.391
<v Speaker 1>and I think it sort of happened to me is</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have your little wake up about </v>

482
00:25:33.391 --> 00:25:35.860
<v Speaker 1>what this sort of uneNding monster on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left is,</v>

483
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.710
<v Speaker 1>everything else collApses pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

484
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.230
<v Speaker 1>So how does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did that collapse,</v>

485
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.600
<v Speaker 1>if the rest of the collapse was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

486
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.220
<v Speaker 1>how did that lead you to where now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so outspoken about feminism and a</v>

487
00:25:48.221 --> 00:25:49.210
<v Speaker 1>series of other issues?</v>

488
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it just,</v>

489
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else didn't collapsed pretty </v>

490
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

491
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

492
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.990
<v Speaker 2>and what I became especially upset about</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

493
00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.880
<v Speaker 2>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

494
00:25:59.881 --> 00:26:04.050
<v Speaker 2>what I came to see as the really </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative environment for,</v>

495
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 2>for young men at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at university because I,</v>

496
00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I began thinking about what it must feel</v>

497
00:26:09.091 --> 00:26:11.460
<v Speaker 2>like to sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

498
00:26:11.461 --> 00:26:15.240
<v Speaker 2>after day after day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing about how all the good things in</v>

499
00:26:15.241 --> 00:26:20.241
<v Speaker 2>the world are the contribution of women </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of the bad things or the </v>

500
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:24.921
<v Speaker 2>contribution of men and how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what young men have to do today is </v>

501
00:26:24.921 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 2>basically just take a step back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>step away from the power as professor </v>

502
00:26:29.941 --> 00:26:34.200
<v Speaker 2>susanna walters said in that Washington </v>
<v Speaker 2>post piece,</v>

503
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:35.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't we hate men?</v>

504
00:26:35.701 --> 00:26:37.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you have to do as a man.</v>

505
00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:42.291
<v Speaker 2>You have to bear the weight of centuries</v>
<v Speaker 2>of male privilege and oppressive </v>

506
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:42.690
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

507
00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.330
<v Speaker 2>And you just have to step back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't run for office,</v>

508
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

509
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if.</v>

510
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>

511
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

512
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:52.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and know,</v>

513
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.580
<v Speaker 2>be abject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize for your soul called privilege</v>

514
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.720
<v Speaker 2>and let your sisters come forward and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the world a better place.</v>

515
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.200
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

516
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.220
<v Speaker 2>that it's so crUde and so ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's an exaggeration </v>

517
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.451
<v Speaker 2>to say that that is the message that </v>
<v Speaker 2>most young men are getting at university</v>

518
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the only way to be a good man is to</v>

519
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:19.881
<v Speaker 2>focus all of your energy and attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>on someone else.</v>

520
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

521
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

522
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:27.050
<v Speaker 2>on helping women or in helping the </v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous or whatever it happens to be </v>

523
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.520
<v Speaker 2>that you can't have your own concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have your own needs and you </v>

524
00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:34.950
<v Speaker 2>certainly can't have your own problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>or issues.</v>

525
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way you can be a good </v>

526
00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:40.270
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

527
00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:40.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

528
00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just seemed to me outrageous.</v>

529
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:47.100
<v Speaker 2>And I kept waiting for other people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say something about it.</v>

530
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:49.260
<v Speaker 2>And I would occasionally talk to others </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and they'd say,</v>

531
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could sort of see.</v>

532
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:52.210
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:27:52.211 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 2>they weren't willing to stick their </v>
<v Speaker 2>necks out in any way.</v>

534
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so finally I just got to the point where</v>

535
00:27:59.221 --> 00:27:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

536
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I should do it.</v>

537
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:06.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird position to be in because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do find so many of the people that </v>

538
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to that have had similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutions to you,</v>

539
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't think of themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly brave or particularly like,</v>

540
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the one that wanted to save the </v>

541
00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 1>world or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get pushed to a point where then</v>

542
00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:21.591
<v Speaker 1>finally you're at that ledge and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>either they're going to push you over </v>

543
00:28:21.591 --> 00:28:24.621
<v Speaker 1>and you'll never speak again and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear or you kind of turn it around </v>

544
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:24.621
<v Speaker 1>and fight back.</v>

545
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in my case I,</v>

546
00:28:27.101 --> 00:28:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially I,</v>

547
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.970
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I because I do get a rush out of </v>

548
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.810
<v Speaker 2>conflict and that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for this particular issue,</v>

549
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:38.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

550
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:43.671
<v Speaker 2>for one thing it's very difficult to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other side of a social justice </v>

551
00:28:44.071 --> 00:28:47.430
<v Speaker 2>issue because to be on the right side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left side,</v>

552
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 2>you have the correct side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say the left side,</v>

553
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:55.080
<v Speaker 2>it's easy because you hear the arguments</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again,</v>

554
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:56.670
<v Speaker 2>so you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

555
00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 2>we just have to open your mouth and out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all come and,</v>

556
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.290
<v Speaker 2>and usually people are stunned into </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed silence as soon as you start</v>

557
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:05.550
<v Speaker 2>attacking them with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

558
00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 2>your various claims and your various </v>
<v Speaker 2>charges against them.</v>

559
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:13.610
<v Speaker 2>But to be able to argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really effectively on the other </v>

560
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.610
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

561
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.090
<v Speaker 2>You not only have to know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

562
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.060
<v Speaker 2>all the left side arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have to,</v>

563
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:19.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>research all,</v>

564
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 2>all these things that you'd been taught </v>
<v Speaker 2>were simply not true or were unthinkable</v>

565
00:29:23.941 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 2>or were impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

566
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

567
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.290
<v Speaker 2>not my area of expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly,</v>

568
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

569
00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:34.690
<v Speaker 2>my area of expertise is literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

570
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:39.890
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think I'm very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to be good in debate and </v>

571
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>answering people's challenging questions</v>

572
00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 2>and I hate all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible at that.</v>

573
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:45.390
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

574
00:29:45.391 --> 00:29:48.450
<v Speaker 2>and so if there were two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

575
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't really,</v>

576
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

577
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't entirely understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

578
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.280
<v Speaker 2>what it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I gave my first couple of </v>

579
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.011
<v Speaker 2>talks and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were protested and they pulled the </v>

580
00:30:02.011 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 2>fire alarms and there were a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>really angry students in the audience.</v>

581
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I really had no idea that it was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like that.</v>

582
00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:12.481
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sort of going to talk about </v>

583
00:30:12.481 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 2>academic feminism in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sort of bounded way.</v>

584
00:30:13.691 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And I knew that because I'd studied it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for years,</v>

585
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't realize I was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked to answer questions about,</v>

586
00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything do with the relations between</v>

587
00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:27.660
<v Speaker 2>men and women and rape and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>big issues.</v>

588
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.120
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't do a very good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think,</v>

589
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.020
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

590
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:31.830
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

591
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:37.250
<v Speaker 2>nobody else is doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I want to keep on.</v>

592
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:41.970
<v Speaker 2>And I started doing my video series </v>
<v Speaker 2>three years ago and um,</v>

593
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:47.570
<v Speaker 2>and that has given me a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction actually because as soon as</v>

594
00:30:47.941 --> 00:30:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I started speaking in public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of emails,</v>

595
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.390
<v Speaker 2>an incredible number of emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly from young men,</v>

596
00:30:57.391 --> 00:31:02.040
<v Speaker 2>some men not that young talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their experiences.</v>

597
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.400
<v Speaker 2>And it blew me away that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know darden's talked about this </v>

598
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:07.620
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

599
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.540
<v Speaker 2>the amount of pain that there is out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

600
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:17.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of young men who just want </v>

601
00:31:19.021 --> 00:31:22.140
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love women in most cases.</v>

602
00:31:22.141 --> 00:31:27.141
<v Speaker 2>They want to have a happy relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never intended to hurt or </v>

603
00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:32.961
<v Speaker 2>oppress anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet they're told that even without </v>

604
00:31:32.961 --> 00:31:36.711
<v Speaker 2>intending to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do just by looking at a young </v>

605
00:31:36.711 --> 00:31:37.070
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:42.090
<v Speaker 2>or asking her out on a date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing some sort of violence and </v>

607
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:46.911
<v Speaker 2>the pain that that has caused and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty and the confusion and the </v>

608
00:31:47.431 --> 00:31:50.490
<v Speaker 2>resentment as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

609
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:55.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some of these young men have </v>

610
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:55.520
<v Speaker 2>themselves been abused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their parents.</v>

611
00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.021
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes their mothers have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>abusive or girlfriends.</v>

612
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.440
<v Speaker 2>And yet they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:06.510
<v Speaker 2>they have to hear over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how it's only men who are ever </v>

614
00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:06.510
<v Speaker 2>abusive.</v>

615
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

616
00:32:08.661 --> 00:32:13.661
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to me like once you go into</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the rabbit hole or whatever it is,</v>

617
00:32:14.821 --> 00:32:16.350
<v Speaker 2>and you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

618
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.460
<v Speaker 2>our culture from the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and every time you turn on the news,</v>

619
00:32:20.461 --> 00:32:22.410
<v Speaker 2>there's yet another story about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

620
00:32:22.411 --> 00:32:27.270
<v Speaker 2>whatever the terrible problem of cat </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling and how it represents,</v>

621
00:32:27.271 --> 00:32:27.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

622
00:32:27.961 --> 00:32:32.961
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deep misogyny of north american </v>

623
00:32:32.961 --> 00:32:33.720
<v Speaker 2>culture and what needs to be done about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and,</v>

624
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of thing kind of thing.</v>

625
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

626
00:32:36.631 --> 00:32:38.250
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's astounding.</v>

627
00:32:38.251 --> 00:32:43.251
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now I sort of feel like I'm with my </v>

628
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:43.251
<v Speaker 2>video is anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that my,</v>

629
00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:48.390
<v Speaker 2>my role is to at least to say to young </v>
<v Speaker 2>men that you're not crazy.</v>

630
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.340
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture is,</v>

631
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.760
<v Speaker 2>is actually crazy.</v>

632
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:58.030
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about this crisis in </v>

633
00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:58.030
<v Speaker 1>masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

634
00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.010
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the right way to phrase it?</v>

635
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you think these?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

636
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

637
00:33:01.051 --> 00:33:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll work.</v>

638
00:33:01.831 --> 00:33:06.831
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there do seem to be so many men </v>

639
00:33:06.831 --> 00:33:06.831
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

640
00:33:06.831 --> 00:33:07.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't hate women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

641
00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:09.270
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't hate themselves,</v>

642
00:33:09.271 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

643
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.120
<v Speaker 1>but they're sort of wounded and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused.</v>

644
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I see these people often at jordan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and I don't even mean that,</v>

645
00:33:17.341 --> 00:33:22.341
<v Speaker 1>that shows her filled with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just people that are kind of </v>

646
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:23.640
<v Speaker 1>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their roadmap is a little screwed up and</v>

647
00:33:23.641 --> 00:33:25.840
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of helping them get back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

648
00:33:25.841 --> 00:33:30.841
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even talk about gender that </v>

649
00:33:30.841 --> 00:33:30.841
<v Speaker 1>often or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any of that stuff.</v>

650
00:33:30.841 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his broader message of clean up your </v>

651
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your stuff together,</v>

652
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:38.901
<v Speaker 1>fix yourself before you fix the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a message that these </v>

653
00:33:39.391 --> 00:33:44.391
<v Speaker 1>people are hearing this crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you able to really figure out how </v>

654
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:45.060
<v Speaker 1>widespread it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

655
00:33:45.061 --> 00:33:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I know you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting sort of emails and you're</v>

656
00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:48.870
<v Speaker 1>putting up your video series and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

657
00:33:48.871 --> 00:33:53.871
<v Speaker 1>but like can you really tell like how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of this as just sort of gone across</v>

658
00:33:54.271 --> 00:33:59.271
<v Speaker 1>culture because it does seem to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the beginnings of the next culture </v>

659
00:33:59.271 --> 00:33:59.271
<v Speaker 1>war?</v>

660
00:33:59.271 --> 00:33:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

661
00:33:59.391 --> 00:33:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

662
00:33:59.691 --> 00:34:00.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

663
00:34:00.241 --> 00:34:02.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say exactly.</v>

664
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly at the university there has </v>

665
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.110
<v Speaker 2>been a tremendous decline in men </v>
<v Speaker 2>attending net.</v>

666
00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Women now dominate in numbers at pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

667
00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every university,</v>

668
00:34:14.691 --> 00:34:18.770
<v Speaker 2>at least in north America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I assume it's true in western europe</v>

669
00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:19.820
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

670
00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:24.821
<v Speaker 2>there might be lots of reasons for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one has to assume that at least a </v>

671
00:34:24.821 --> 00:34:29.471
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason is that men feel that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a place for them at the </v>

672
00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

673
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:36.030
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relentless man blaming and shaming </v>

674
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 2>that goes on there has got to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to do with that I would think.</v>

675
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are a number of reports </v>

676
00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.051
<v Speaker 2>certainly that I've read recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate that in a whole bunch of other </v>

677
00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:51.401
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men are just not doing very well </v>

678
00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:54.820
<v Speaker 2>generally either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a report that came out a few </v>

679
00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.390
<v Speaker 2>years ago called I'm a wayward sons.</v>

680
00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:01.420
<v Speaker 2>It came out of mit to economists talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>

681
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a number of different metrics,</v>

682
00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was skills acquisition,</v>

683
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.620
<v Speaker 2>a real wages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just employment numbers.</v>

684
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>job status.</v>

685
00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Men are falling behind women really </v>
<v Speaker 2>shockingly,</v>

686
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.970
<v Speaker 2>and then that's leading into all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of other social problems too.</v>

687
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Men are not getting married because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not in a position to be able to </v>

688
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:35.321
<v Speaker 2>support a family and there are many </v>
<v Speaker 2>other reasons why men are not getting </v>

689
00:35:35.321 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 2>married as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Then that means that I'm more and</v>

690
00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:41.771
<v Speaker 2>more women are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are raising their children outside of </v>

691
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:47.030
<v Speaker 2>marriage and that often has very bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>impacts for the boys in those single mom</v>

692
00:35:49.391 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

693
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:51.710
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

694
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.430
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be the ones that are hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>most by the lack of a father.</v>

695
00:35:56.431 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so yeah,</v>

696
00:35:58.141 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 2>it certainly seems that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty widespread problems.</v>

697
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:06.861
<v Speaker 2>Suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male suicide is something that a lot of </v>

698
00:36:06.861 --> 00:36:10.770
<v Speaker 2>people that I work with are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about mental illness,</v>

699
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they call failure to launch,</v>

700
00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:17.991
<v Speaker 2>meaning just a lot of young men just </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that there isn't anything for </v>

701
00:36:17.991 --> 00:36:21.501
<v Speaker 2>them in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why even try to contribute </v>

702
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.660
<v Speaker 2>anything to it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does seem to be a pretty widespread </v>

703
00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 2>problem from what people like warren </v>
<v Speaker 2>farrell,</v>

704
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:31.260
<v Speaker 2>who studied the subject for years </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly.</v>

705
00:36:31.261 --> 00:36:33.390
<v Speaker 2>And of course christina hoff sommers as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

706
00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:33.640
<v Speaker 2>or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

707
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.700
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the tactics that you've seen </v>

708
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.970
<v Speaker 1>work effectively to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone contacts you and you know,</v>

709
00:36:39.971 --> 00:36:44.971
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're feeling all of the things that </v>

710
00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:44.971
<v Speaker 1>you've discussed or not feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're experiencing,</v>

711
00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:52.620
<v Speaker 1>do you have a sorta a groundwork for how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can kind of get their lives in </v>

712
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.010
<v Speaker 1>order and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fight some of this.</v>

713
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.350
<v Speaker 1>It's really just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just making them aware.</v>

714
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd be friends with them and,</v>

715
00:36:58.291 --> 00:36:59.610
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

716
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.030
<v Speaker 2>I tell them that what they're feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a real basis.</v>

717
00:37:03.031 --> 00:37:08.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean that part of the problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're told that they're their only </v>

718
00:37:08.031 --> 00:37:09.290
<v Speaker 2>problem is a sense of entitlement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:14.250
<v Speaker 2>which is the last thing that's true </v>
<v Speaker 2>about men's experience today.</v>

720
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.760
<v Speaker 2>So part of the thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

721
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I think many of the young men that write</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

722
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not that they necessarily think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the biggest victims in the </v>

723
00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.920
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that there is not even a smidgen of</v>

724
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:33.921
<v Speaker 2>awareness that they would ever have </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to worry about.</v>

725
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.860
<v Speaker 2>The sense that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that they have.</v>

726
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 2>It's because they're so privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

727
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.490
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a weird ways is through that lens.</v>

728
00:37:43.491 --> 00:37:45.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have everything.</v>

729
00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:46.250
<v Speaker 1>You should feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

730
00:37:46.251 --> 00:37:51.251
<v Speaker 1>you've been handed everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then is continually making you feel </v>

731
00:37:51.251 --> 00:37:55.001
<v Speaker 1>like crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a completely double edge </v>

732
00:37:55.001 --> 00:37:55.001
<v Speaker 1>sword because you're supposed to feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

733
00:37:55.001 --> 00:37:56.720
<v Speaker 1>You feel like crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're never given you a chance to feel</v>

734
00:37:56.721 --> 00:37:59.690
<v Speaker 1>good because there's nothing you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get yourself out of it.</v>

735
00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

736
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:01.510
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

737
00:38:01.511 --> 00:38:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

738
00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:07.180
<v Speaker 2>it is a devastating social problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

739
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:09.430
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

740
00:38:09.431 --> 00:38:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact extent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

741
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 2>but from what people who know and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>studied it more certainly indicating </v>

742
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.640
<v Speaker 2>that it is a growing problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

743
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

744
00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the circles that,</v>

745
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 2>that I sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

746
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.040
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

747
00:38:24.041 --> 00:38:29.041
<v Speaker 2>there's this movement called meg towel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm know you know about and I'm a </v>

748
00:38:29.041 --> 00:38:32.680
<v Speaker 2>man who are just have decided the </v>
<v Speaker 2>acronym breakdown to men going their own</v>

749
00:38:32.681 --> 00:38:33.210
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

750
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

751
00:38:33.951 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not an on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on meg towels.</v>

752
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Certainly women who are we fighting for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

753
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:40.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

754
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 2>for them to think of me pronouncing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

755
00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

756
00:38:42.881 --> 00:38:47.881
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there can be different reasons and </v>

757
00:38:47.881 --> 00:38:47.881
<v Speaker 2>in the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the broadest definition,</v>

758
00:38:47.881 --> 00:38:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just men saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

759
00:38:49.451 --> 00:38:54.451
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to focus my life around my own</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuits and I'm not going to focus my </v>

760
00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:57.610
<v Speaker 2>life around a woman.</v>

761
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.660
<v Speaker 2>And these men tend to think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually that's a trap that a lot of men</v>

762
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 2>fall into is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is making everything about a woman.</v>

763
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can get,</v>

764
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really can be destroyed if you,</v>

765
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:14.701
<v Speaker 2>if the woman you happen to focus your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life around is crazy or malevolent in </v>

766
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:20.020
<v Speaker 2>some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can destroy her man.</v>

767
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by making a claim of abuse,</v>

768
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 2>he can find that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

769
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.640
<v Speaker 2>the marriage he built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the home that he built,</v>

770
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 2>the children that he fathered all can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken away from him.</v>

771
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:33.940
<v Speaker 2>His life can be destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his business can be taken away,</v>

772
00:39:33.941 --> 00:39:35.830
<v Speaker 2>his reputation could be ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

773
00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.960
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

774
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:42.160
<v Speaker 2>and so there's so much risk to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>young men in these involvements that a </v>

775
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 2>lot of them are just deciding a safer </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to,</v>

776
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 2>not to risk anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a more general thing</v>

777
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

778
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

779
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:56.730
<v Speaker 2>anyone it has to do with that sense that</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day in some way,</v>

780
00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:02.760
<v Speaker 2>some of these men are beginning to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like their society just doesn't even </v>

781
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.210
<v Speaker 2>like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even that they're expendable,</v>

782
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:09.211
<v Speaker 2>which I think most men who have studied </v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation of men throughout history </v>

783
00:40:09.211 --> 00:40:11.290
<v Speaker 2>would say that's always been the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men have always been,</v>

784
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:12.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men are the ones that go to war.</v>

785
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Why to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect the women.</v>

786
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.240
<v Speaker 2>So this idea that all of human history </v>
<v Speaker 2>is about male power and privilege and,</v>

787
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:21.930
<v Speaker 2>and men abusing women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

788
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:27.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men and say it's actually the </v>

789
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:27.010
<v Speaker 2>exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

790
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 2>women have always been the ones who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>precious in society,</v>

791
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:33.250
<v Speaker 2>particularly in western society and know</v>
<v Speaker 2>chivalry and everything else.</v>

792
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was always the situation.</v>

793
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:42.181
<v Speaker 2>But expandability is one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to be actually despised by your </v>

794
00:40:42.181 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your society,</v>

795
00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:45.370
<v Speaker 2>and told that there's nothing good about</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

796
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:50.371
<v Speaker 2>that even your sacrifices aren't good </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough and yet you're still supposed to </v>

797
00:40:50.371 --> 00:40:51.970
<v Speaker 2>make the sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they'll never,</v>

798
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:57.180
<v Speaker 2>you'll never get any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of public acknowledgement of </v>

799
00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.120
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why we say it's bOwing forever.</v>

800
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 2>There is no reclamation here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

801
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a perpetual stay there.</v>

802
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can never purge your toxic </v>

803
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:12.100
<v Speaker 2>masculinity no matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you die,</v>

804
00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:12.890
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

805
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.380
<v Speaker 2>rescuing somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

806
00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:15.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even then,</v>

807
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

808
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that gets flipped over and then</v>

809
00:41:19.001 --> 00:41:20.460
<v Speaker 2>that's an example of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.670
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

811
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 2>objectification of women or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

812
00:41:23.591 --> 00:41:24.940
<v Speaker 2>it really is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

813
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.120
<v Speaker 2>it's sick when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you listen to.</v>

814
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read lately so many studies.</v>

815
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:32.200
<v Speaker 2>One about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

816
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:36.590
<v Speaker 2>this was by a feminist sociologist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociology is really,</v>

817
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just crazy.</v>

818
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:43.210
<v Speaker 2>this was a woman who has done work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the homeless in ontario.</v>

819
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:49.900
<v Speaker 2>And her whole shtick was about how I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>even amongst the homeless a certain,</v>

820
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:58.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas associated with hegemonic </v>

821
00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.700
<v Speaker 2>masculinity could still be found in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

822
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.740
<v Speaker 2>she interviewed various homeless men and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the homeless are </v>

823
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:09.760
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly men right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

824
00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be for it points to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

825
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it say something about male </v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege in our society that you,</v>

826
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk around the streets of ottawa,</v>

827
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.480
<v Speaker 2>you almost never see a homeless woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a lot of homeless men and a lot </v>

828
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.140
<v Speaker 2>of homeless white men as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>homeless anyway.</v>

829
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

830
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:32.021
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she had done thIs work with homeless </v>

831
00:42:32.021 --> 00:42:32.021
<v Speaker 2>men and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

832
00:42:32.021 --> 00:42:36.040
<v Speaker 2>and she interviewed them and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she found that either either they were </v>

833
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.461
<v Speaker 2>lamenting the loss of their hegemonic </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity or they were even so trying </v>

834
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 2>to assert their hegemonic masculinity in</v>
<v Speaker 2>various ways.</v>

835
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:45.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

836
00:42:45.111 --> 00:42:48.860
<v Speaker 2>it was truly crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had nothing to do.</v>

837
00:42:48.861 --> 00:42:53.861
<v Speaker 2>And she actually recommended at the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the article that program's working </v>

838
00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 2>with these men should perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

839
00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:02.240
<v Speaker 2>help them to whatever renounced their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hegemonic masculinity.</v>

840
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.050
<v Speaker 2>There was another</v>

841
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.640
<v Speaker 1>article that's obviously their number </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

842
00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their number one problem.</v>

843
00:43:06.131 --> 00:43:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just unbelievable.</v>

844
00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:12.541
<v Speaker 2>There was another article I read just </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently saying that the programs to </v>

845
00:43:12.541 --> 00:43:16.410
<v Speaker 2>encourage men to be responsible fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>

846
00:43:16.781 --> 00:43:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I think these were american programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she was studying,</v>

847
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that such programs also reinforce </v>

848
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.990
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal because they reinforce this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that um,</v>

849
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men have an important role to play as </v>

850
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.191
<v Speaker 2>fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she actually said that this was a </v>

851
00:43:35.191 --> 00:43:38.641
<v Speaker 2>typical reassertion of patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking in that the implicit assumption</v>

852
00:43:39.401 --> 00:43:44.401
<v Speaker 2>was that women that mothers aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficient for their children.</v>

853
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:50.460
<v Speaker 2>So I mean she basically outright said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that children don't need fathers </v>

854
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:54.250
<v Speaker 2>and fathers have no necessary role In </v>
<v Speaker 2>their children's lives.</v>

855
00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.120
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of scientific evidence at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

856
00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 2>That's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

857
00:43:58.911 --> 00:44:01.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's deeply damaging to children.</v>

858
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you sense that there's a movement now</v>
<v Speaker 1>for women and I think you'd probably be </v>

859
00:44:06.921 --> 00:44:11.000
<v Speaker 1>included in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that young women that are looking to</v>

860
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:12.420
<v Speaker 1>get married and in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

861
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.210
<v Speaker 1>late teens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early twenties,</v>

862
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:19.900
<v Speaker 1>that they want men back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can only give an anecdotal example </v>

863
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:22.400
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a lot of single,</v>

864
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 1>straight female friends that have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives together,</v>

865
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:28.070
<v Speaker 1>have jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of themselves,</v>

866
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:29.060
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Etc.</v>

867
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And we have this running joke that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know virtually any straight men </v>

868
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:41.151
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of gay guys that seemingly </v>

869
00:44:41.151 --> 00:44:43.311
<v Speaker 1>have their lives together and that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all of those things and that's </v>

870
00:44:43.311 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you have any thoughts on</v>

871
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:46.230
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sorta kinda decide barb,</v>

872
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:48.870
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that they're,</v>

873
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:53.340
<v Speaker 1>they want there to be men to find and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become like a running joke for me.</v>

874
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know where they are.</v>

875
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

876
00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I think those women are going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>start asking why it is that they're not </v>

877
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the,</v>

878
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:08.650
<v Speaker 2>the reason I would say is precisely that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just not,</v>

879
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.210
<v Speaker 2>they're not willing anymore to be there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't possible.</v>

880
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously there are lots of men </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are still willing to take on </v>

881
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.140
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and be the achievers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

882
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.170
<v Speaker 2>But I think there has been sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

883
00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:25.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of men are,</v>

884
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:30.550
<v Speaker 2>are disgusted with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the paucity of options that are,</v>

885
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.640
<v Speaker 2>that are offered to them and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

886
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

887
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:39.970
<v Speaker 2>just there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are too many risks for them </v>

888
00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:43.060
<v Speaker 2>involved in doing the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>might have once wanted to do.</v>

889
00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of men are,</v>

890
00:45:45.281 --> 00:45:50.281
<v Speaker 2>are damaged too from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decades of relentless propaganda,</v>

891
00:45:52.091 --> 00:45:53.770
<v Speaker 2>anti male propaganda.</v>

892
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.660
<v Speaker 1>How do you think this is all connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the me too movement?</v>

893
00:45:56.661 --> 00:45:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So I just want to be clear on one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as we're taping this,</v>

894
00:45:59.541 --> 00:46:01.310
<v Speaker 1>because I'm on tour with Jordan at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

895
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.110
<v Speaker 1>we are holding this video for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

896
00:46:03.111 --> 00:46:08.111
<v Speaker 1>So the moment we're taping this right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now is the cabin our hearings and it </v>

897
00:46:08.111 --> 00:46:09.980
<v Speaker 1>just feels like everything that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

898
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.470
<v Speaker 1>talked about here for the last 45 or so </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

899
00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:17.000
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's all being unearthed </v>
<v Speaker 1>now publicly in our political arena.</v>

900
00:46:17.001 --> 00:46:22.001
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think this is so much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a culture thing than a political </v>

901
00:46:22.001 --> 00:46:26.021
<v Speaker 1>thing directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But can you relate all of this to me </v>

902
00:46:26.021 --> 00:46:26.021
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>

903
00:46:26.021 --> 00:46:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much about me too.</v>

904
00:46:26.931 --> 00:46:31.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think partly what me to represented </v>

905
00:46:31.931 --> 00:46:35.141
<v Speaker 2>for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like so many women have been told </v>

906
00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:40.660
<v Speaker 2>for so many years that the whole history</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our culture is a history of male </v>

907
00:46:42.051 --> 00:46:43.730
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

908
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.840
<v Speaker 2>but in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

909
00:46:44.841 --> 00:46:46.210
<v Speaker 2>most women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

910
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:51.250
<v Speaker 2>least I would say lower middle class to </v>
<v Speaker 2>upper middle class women have had lives </v>

911
00:46:53.211 --> 00:46:57.500
<v Speaker 2>in which they have been told from day </v>
<v Speaker 2>one that they really matter.</v>

912
00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Certainly that was my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

913
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born in 1964,</v>

914
00:47:01.221 --> 00:47:06.221
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was the beneficiary of the </v>

915
00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:11.590
<v Speaker 2>second wave feminist movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly I always knew that </v>

916
00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.510
<v Speaker 2>everybody in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the people at my school,</v>

917
00:47:14.511 --> 00:47:16.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the coaches,</v>

918
00:47:16.191 --> 00:47:18.470
<v Speaker 2>the mentors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the teachers,</v>

919
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:22.490
<v Speaker 2>they wanted me to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of women have had that</v>

920
00:47:22.491 --> 00:47:23.000
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>

921
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.110
<v Speaker 2>new you can do whatever you want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we encourage you to go,</v>

922
00:47:27.111 --> 00:47:27.830
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:47:27.831 --> 00:47:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you can be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be a,</v>

924
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 2>a rocket scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do something else,</v>

925
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:32.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

926
00:47:32.631 --> 00:47:34.780
<v Speaker 2>and whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be supported in it,</v>

927
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.900
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an antifeminist now second wave </v>

928
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 2>feminism back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good.</v>

929
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

930
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.010
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

931
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had the seeds of the deep patriot of </v>

932
00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:49.050
<v Speaker 2>men in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

933
00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:53.730
<v Speaker 2>it was the one that started a rape </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and the history of women was a </v>

934
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:58.921
<v Speaker 2>history of male sexual violence and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>men kept women in check by,</v>

935
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 2>by sexually abusing them or by </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening them with sexual abuse.</v>

936
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:06.460
<v Speaker 2>When you said that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were born out of that,</v>

937
00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.860
<v Speaker 2>that things were okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

938
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.210
<v Speaker 2>certainly things were wonderful in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>19 seventies.</v>

939
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my argument would be that they would </v>

940
00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:15.210
<v Speaker 2>have been pretty good anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

941
00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:19.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think ever since women got the vote </v>

942
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.620
<v Speaker 2>and men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're happy to extend it to them without</v>

943
00:48:20.621 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 2>any of the responsibilities that men who</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the vote had always had to take on,</v>

944
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:30.061
<v Speaker 2>such as military service and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>willingness to die for you're defending </v>

945
00:48:30.061 --> 00:48:30.290
<v Speaker 2>your country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

946
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I think everything every ever since that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

947
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:37.561
<v Speaker 2>basically men have shown themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty open to admitting women into the </v>

948
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:42.520
<v Speaker 2>professions and encouraging women to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

949
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:47.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make whatever kind of contribution </v>

950
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:47.540
<v Speaker 2>they could make to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

951
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:47.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to our culture.</v>

952
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

953
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:53.070
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things to talk about </v>

954
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:53.070
<v Speaker 2>that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

955
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.300
<v Speaker 2>so basically what I would say though is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that women,</v>

956
00:48:55.301 --> 00:49:00.301
<v Speaker 2>while at the same lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while being encouraged while feeling </v>

957
00:49:00.301 --> 00:49:04.261
<v Speaker 2>that they are an awful lot of positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and energy are focused on them</v>

958
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.220
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've always been fed this,</v>

959
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.840
<v Speaker 2>this revenge narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:14.850
<v Speaker 2>that somehow the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all terrible for hundreds and </v>

961
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:14.850
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of years.</v>

962
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 2>They've been abused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

963
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:21.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're getting to the point now we're </v>

964
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.541
<v Speaker 2>having been fed that and I really do </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it is an outright lie.</v>

965
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:29.380
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is to now that all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>history has been sort of rewritten.</v>

966
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:34.381
<v Speaker 2>And so it's actually very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out the reality of history because </v>

967
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:39.420
<v Speaker 2>we have it filtered through our popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and things we think we know </v>

968
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:39.760
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

969
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:44.761
<v Speaker 2>women winning the right to vote and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that there were a whole bunch of </v>

970
00:49:44.761 --> 00:49:48.271
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly in Canada and great britain </v>

971
00:49:48.271 --> 00:49:50.551
<v Speaker 2>who couldn't vote at the same time the </v>
<v Speaker 2>women were campaigning for the right to </v>

972
00:49:50.551 --> 00:49:52.090
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost nobody knows that at all,</v>

973
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 2>which men couldn't vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or those poor men.</v>

974
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

975
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.370
<v Speaker 2>there were property and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

976
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.280
<v Speaker 2>wage qualifications at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

977
00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:04.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

978
00:50:04.271 --> 00:50:05.950
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were certain restrictions.</v>

979
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Many of the men who went and fought in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first world war,</v>

980
00:50:08.321 --> 00:50:09.460
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the young men,</v>

981
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.790
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't vote either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

982
00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.890
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have this idea that for centuries</v>

983
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:18.170
<v Speaker 2>men could vote and basically ran society</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

984
00:50:18.171 --> 00:50:19.690
<v Speaker 2>and women couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in fact,</v>

985
00:50:19.691 --> 00:50:22.990
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a very narrow window when most</v>

986
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:26.170
<v Speaker 2>men could vote and when women couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

987
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:26.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

988
00:50:26.871 --> 00:50:31.871
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have these ideas that women were the </v>

989
00:50:31.871 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 2>property of their fathers or their </v>
<v Speaker 2>husbands and that they were abused,</v>

990
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.100
<v Speaker 2>that nobody believed them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nobody cared if they were raped.</v>

991
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:42.101
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that's coming out now </v>

992
00:50:42.101 --> 00:50:44.350
<v Speaker 2>is I've heard a number of high profile </v>
<v Speaker 2>female commentators say in just up until</v>

993
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:51.311
<v Speaker 2>the recent past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody believed a woman if she said </v>

994
00:50:51.311 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 2>she'd been raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we're going to believe them.</v>

995
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if that were true,</v>

996
00:50:55.370 --> 00:51:00.370
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't make sense and it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be just obviously to suddenly now just </v>

997
00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:04.390
<v Speaker 2>believe every time a woman says that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man has done something to her and we </v>

998
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:05.900
<v Speaker 2>we're going to destroy that man's career</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we're going to put them in jail.</v>

999
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Was that the most pervasive part of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1000
00:51:08.141 --> 00:51:13.141
<v Speaker 1>that there's a growing feeling amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>this crew that in order to make an </v>

1001
00:51:13.141 --> 00:51:17.491
<v Speaker 1>omelet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to break certain </v>

1002
00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:17.491
<v Speaker 1>thing so that you're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're quite literally.</v>

1003
00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this again from that class of blue</v>

1004
00:51:19.541 --> 00:51:24.100
<v Speaker 1>check twitter feminists or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reporters or whatever they are.</v>

1005
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay if a couple of innocent people</v>

1006
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.670
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>

1007
00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that over and over again.</v>

1008
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be.</v>

1009
00:51:29.991 --> 00:51:34.991
<v Speaker 2>It is perfectly okay because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>centuries and centuries of abuse and </v>

1010
00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:39.821
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy idea of retributive </v>

1011
00:51:39.821 --> 00:51:42.110
<v Speaker 2>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm punishing people as a class,</v>

1012
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:44.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of people,</v>

1013
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:50.020
<v Speaker 2>a lot of while both women and men who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who by that narrative are so whipped up,</v>

1014
00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:51.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1015
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 2>in outrage over women's supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering over the centuries that </v>

1016
00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 2>they're quite willing to see some men </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer.</v>

1017
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1018
00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I read an article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you saw it too saying that </v>

1019
00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:05.140
<v Speaker 2>cavenaugh should not be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1020
00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.880
<v Speaker 2>the denomination should be withdrawn </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1021
00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although maybe we shouldn't put men into</v>

1022
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:16.540
<v Speaker 2>prison just based on a woman's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsubstantiated and story from 36 years </v>

1023
00:52:16.761 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hey,</v>

1024
00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:18.590
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1025
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:19.910
<v Speaker 2>supreme court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1026
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.850
<v Speaker 2>all but five men in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1027
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 2>in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get to do that.</v>

1028
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:25.460
<v Speaker 2>so big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1029
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:30.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's certainly been the </v>

1030
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:30.640
<v Speaker 2>attitude about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

1031
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.650
<v Speaker 2>the tribunals that have been put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in american universities to,</v>

1032
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would say,</v>

1033
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no like there,</v>

1034
00:52:36.341 --> 00:52:41.341
<v Speaker 2>there are no standards of justice here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no opportunity to cross examine </v>

1035
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:44.330
<v Speaker 2>witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to have a lawyer.</v>

1036
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:49.331
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the men weren't even allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know what the charges against them </v>

1037
00:52:49.331 --> 00:52:49.340
<v Speaker 2>were and they'd always come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1038
00:52:49.341 --> 00:52:51.770
<v Speaker 2>but they're not going to be put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>

1039
00:52:51.771 --> 00:52:55.640
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to be expelled from </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities as a pretty minor.</v>

1040
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1041
00:52:57.011 --> 00:53:02.011
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think this topic is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because I'm not </v>

1042
00:53:02.011 --> 00:53:02.620
<v Speaker 1>particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't particularly care about feminism</v>

1043
00:53:02.621 --> 00:53:03.990
<v Speaker 1>or any of these isms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One word there.</v>

1044
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I want everyone to be treated equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least I want.</v>

1045
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I want the laws of the nation to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone equally and then it's on you to</v>

1046
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
<v Speaker 1>figure out the rest and sometimes there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are bad people and you have to go out </v>

1047
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and do it yourself and figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1048
00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but what now I see happening and now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see why this,</v>

1049
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:23.850
<v Speaker 1>this sort of crazed feminism piece is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly related to free speech or the </v>

1050
00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:28.710
<v Speaker 1>issues I really care about is the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're.</v>

1051
00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.370
<v Speaker 1>This is connected to due process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is connected to.</v>

1052
00:53:32.371 --> 00:53:37.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna break a couple of eggs and </v>

1053
00:53:37.371 --> 00:53:37.371
<v Speaker 1>we're actually going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to probably jail people.</v>

1054
00:53:37.371 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 1>We're going to probably get people fired</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of these things that you've put </v>

1055
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do see these,</v>

1056
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.720
<v Speaker 1>these ties to much greater issues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in a weird way,</v>

1057
00:53:45.721 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 1>this is why a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think peter goes into,</v>

1058
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:53.031
<v Speaker 1>I've had on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has talked about how the gender studies </v>

1059
00:53:53.031 --> 00:53:55.830
<v Speaker 1>really is ground zero for this entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

1060
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1061
00:53:57.590 --> 00:53:59.120
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen this.</v>

1062
00:53:59.121 --> 00:54:03.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean this has been going on in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a number of years and it does.</v>

1063
00:54:03.501 --> 00:54:05.750
<v Speaker 2>And gender studies is the ground zero I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

1064
00:54:05.751 --> 00:54:07.430
<v Speaker 2>and part of it is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1065
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idEa that the,</v>

1066
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:11.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like the presumption of innocence</v>

1067
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:15.680
<v Speaker 2>that those really are structures </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed,</v>

1068
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.090
<v Speaker 2>especially in the cases of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1069
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:22.210
<v Speaker 2>sexual assault law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's designed to protect bad men.</v>

1070
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:23.950
<v Speaker 2>And therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>

1071
00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:28.580
<v Speaker 2>so I've read all sorts of articles by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by law students saying,</v>

1072
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:32.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what we know,</v>

1073
00:54:32.211 --> 00:54:36.590
<v Speaker 2>what rape trials look like when </v>
<v Speaker 2>presumption of innocence is the,</v>

1074
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:41.770
<v Speaker 2>is the default or is the standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would they look like if we started </v>

1075
00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:46.220
<v Speaker 2>by believing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that whole notion of believing women</v>

1076
00:54:46.221 --> 00:54:49.190
<v Speaker 2>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the fundamental legal standard.</v>

1077
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:50.960
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

1078
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:56.890
<v Speaker 1>What do you think are the best steps to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help people that are waking up?</v>

1079
00:54:58.851 --> 00:55:00.700
<v Speaker 1>So you talked about how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1080
00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get all these emails from men and </v>

1081
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you can hopefully listen to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

1082
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.730
<v Speaker 1>But if they're there because they're out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1083
00:55:07.731 --> 00:55:09.050
<v Speaker 1>they're watching this right now.</v>

1084
00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hopeful.</v>

1085
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1086
00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

1087
00:55:13.891 --> 00:55:17.070
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're really in a mess right now.</v>

1088
00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1089
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 2>if I wanted to say something really </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory,</v>

1090
00:55:22.681 --> 00:55:27.681
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would say is that when I was a </v>

1091
00:55:27.681 --> 00:55:29.781
<v Speaker 2>phd student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to read newspapers from the 18 </v>

1092
00:55:29.781 --> 00:55:30.660
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>

1093
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:31.360
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eighties,</v>

1094
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.570
<v Speaker 2>nineties because that was my period that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working in.</v>

1095
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:38.750
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted to see what kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations were going on and I did a </v>

1096
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.210
<v Speaker 2>feminist phd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was interested in,</v>

1097
00:55:41.211 --> 00:55:44.610
<v Speaker 2>in female journalists of the 18 eighties</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nineties.</v>

1098
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:49.611
<v Speaker 2>And there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there Were all sorts of debates about </v>

1099
00:55:49.611 --> 00:55:50.220
<v Speaker 2>gender relations as we would call it now</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on then.</v>

1100
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.450
<v Speaker 2>And one of them was a question of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women's political role,</v>

1101
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:55.020
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1102
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.660
<v Speaker 2>to what extent should women be </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically involved.</v>

1103
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 2>And really the late 19th century was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>time when,</v>

1104
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:03.920
<v Speaker 2>because of advances in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1105
00:56:03.921 --> 00:56:08.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a domestic equipment and because of some</v>

1106
00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:13.011
<v Speaker 2>rudimentary birth control measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when more women were able to make a </v>

1107
00:56:13.171 --> 00:56:18.171
<v Speaker 2>contribution at the public level in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they'd never really been able to </v>

1108
00:56:18.171 --> 00:56:19.090
<v Speaker 2>unless I had been single.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1109
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.130
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1110
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:25.220
<v Speaker 2>so there were all these debates and know</v>
<v Speaker 2>most men were pretty enthusiastic about </v>

1111
00:56:25.721 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 2>the idea of women becoming more publicly</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

1112
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 2>And there was very much a sense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>women would.</v>

1113
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Women brought a certain kind of morality</v>
<v Speaker 2>that women were superior morally than </v>

1114
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:38.110
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we still see that now.</v>

1115
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole idea that women don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>lie about things,</v>

1116
00:56:41.181 --> 00:56:42.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about rape or,</v>

1117
00:56:42.651 --> 00:56:45.010
<v Speaker 2>and various other things that women can </v>
<v Speaker 2>end war.</v>

1118
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Women can negotiate better than men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that,</v>

1119
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all ties in.</v>

1120
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's true.</v>

1121
00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:57.030
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still the idea that women have </v>

1122
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.970
<v Speaker 2>something in them that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1123
00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:03.020
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is perhaps morally superior or gives </v>

1124
00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:03.730
<v Speaker 2>them a certain qualities that men don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have still there.</v>

1125
00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:05.980
<v Speaker 2>So it was very much that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1126
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:07.150
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1127
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:10.580
<v Speaker 2>the anti feminist position at the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>said it.</v>

1128
00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.870
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are too emotional.</v>

1129
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Women are less rational than men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women can take pr,</v>

1130
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:23.430
<v Speaker 2>they personalize everything so they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not able to sort of separate themselves </v>

1131
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.890
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1132
00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:28.891
<v Speaker 2>make decisions that in an objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbiased manner and you have that kind </v>

1133
00:57:30.101 --> 00:57:31.710
<v Speaker 2>of thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1134
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:36.740
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was related to women's biology and </v>

1135
00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:36.940
<v Speaker 2>various things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I used to laugh and think</v>

1136
00:57:36.941 --> 00:57:40.630
<v Speaker 2>how ridiculous that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet I have to say that over the last</v>

1137
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:45.631
<v Speaker 2>10 years as I have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean because me to which claims it's </v>

1138
00:57:45.631 --> 00:57:45.790
<v Speaker 2>this new conversation.</v>

1139
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:50.790
<v Speaker 2>It isn't really new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this has been going on at least </v>

1140
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:51.810
<v Speaker 2>since anita hill and clarence thomas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1141
00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:56.850
<v Speaker 2>certainly throughout the 19 nineties </v>
<v Speaker 2>following anita hill's charges against </v>

1142
00:57:56.850 --> 00:58:01.771
<v Speaker 2>thomas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of discussion about </v>

1143
00:58:01.771 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment in the workplace and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to do about it.</v>

1144
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 2>A lot of legislation brought in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>innocent men,</v>

1145
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:10.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplined or fired from their jobs as </v>

1146
00:58:10.711 --> 00:58:13.051
<v Speaker 2>a result of various claims women made </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'd been made to feel </v>

1147
00:58:13.051 --> 00:58:13.750
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happened to be.</v>

1148
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:16.720
<v Speaker 2>And so This has been going on for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1149
00:58:16.721 --> 00:58:21.721
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have to say that it makes me </v>

1150
00:58:21.721 --> 00:58:24.211
<v Speaker 2>wonder sometimes whether those </v>
<v Speaker 2>antifeminist from the late 19th century </v>

1151
00:58:24.211 --> 00:58:28.620
<v Speaker 2>were right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That what is it about this mass movement</v>

1152
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:36.510
<v Speaker 2>so angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this movement of vengeance that is </v>

1153
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:40.861
<v Speaker 2>starting to make these completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrational claims about how we should </v>

1154
00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:43.540
<v Speaker 2>proceed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who we should believe,</v>

1155
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:48.630
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it doesn't matter that we suspend </v>

1156
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:50.260
<v Speaker 2>basic principles of presumption of </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocence and due process.</v>

1157
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:55.500
<v Speaker 2>How can it be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is actually being taken seriously </v>

1158
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.340
<v Speaker 2>in our public culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

1159
00:58:57.341 --> 00:59:02.341
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do have to wonder whether the </v>

1160
00:59:02.341 --> 00:59:05.101
<v Speaker 2>presence of women isn't having some kind</v>
