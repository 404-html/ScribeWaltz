1
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.490
<v Speaker 1>You're saying different for our third </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

2
00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:06.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get away from atheism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion today,</v>

3
00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:07.664
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to focus on another </v>

4
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>passion of mine politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real quick though.</v>

5
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.103
<v Speaker 1>I should thank all of you that listened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to last week's direct message and </v>

6
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:15.614
<v Speaker 1>actually took it into action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are calling out the bullshit </v>

7
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>artists on every social media platform </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've never seen before.</v>

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>As I said last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you guys are engaged,</v>

9
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>we can focus on other things and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just have the same conversation over and</v>

10
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:27.614
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.493
<v Speaker 1>I've really only been intimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in this conversation for a </v>

12
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks fighting the lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only exhausting,</v>

13
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>but it has also affected a couple of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships.</v>

14
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.093
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do think that part of the plan </v>

15
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:39.284
<v Speaker 1>by these people is to tire out the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and to giving up your part in this </v>

16
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:43.700
<v Speaker 1>debate is beyond crucial.</v>

17
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>But enough of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk politics.</v>

18
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I was at the gop debate at the Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Library last week.</v>

19
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.093
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to one of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and I really had no idea what to </v>

20
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.184
<v Speaker 1>expect behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a booth in the spin room right </v>

21
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>alongside CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>MSNBC,</v>

22
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>and Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they call it the spin room</v>

23
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>really tells you all you need to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this thing.</v>

24
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>This is where campaign people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates go to spin their message.</v>

25
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I went to the truth room next door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody was there.</v>

26
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

27
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.403
<v Speaker 1>We were able to snag surrogates from </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much every candidate except for </v>

28
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:13.034
<v Speaker 1>Carly Fiorina and Donald trump because </v>
<v Speaker 1>neither of them sent any reps to the </v>

29
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:16.484
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even got to ask John a question about </v>

30
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage and Scott Walker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a question about money in politics.</v>

31
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Come to think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what caused him to drop out</v>

32
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>of the race earlier this week.</v>

33
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.633
<v Speaker 1>What I realized by being on the inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all this is that there are some </v>

34
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>unspoken rules to how the game is </v>
<v Speaker 1>played.</v>

35
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Mike Huckabee's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign manager about gay marriage,</v>

36
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>and she basically just danced around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had I pushed her to the breaking point,</v>

37
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.304
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have never gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to her again and then word would </v>

38
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>have traveled fast that I'm someone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't talk to.</v>

39
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.053
<v Speaker 1>So with that in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried my best to navigate all the </v>

40
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>interviews with some basic questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then some deeper probing.</v>

41
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.143
<v Speaker 1>I asked pretty much everyone about </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign finance and I really pushed on </v>

42
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:53.444
<v Speaker 1>social issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big learning experience and </v>

43
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure out how to engage with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates and the representatives in an</v>

44
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>even more incisive way beyond the spin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sound soundbites.</v>

45
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully as the show gets bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to more of the debates.</v>

46
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Candidates will eventually realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be tough but honest,</v>

47
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we agree or not,</v>

48
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.813
<v Speaker 1>we're planning out our plan to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first democratic debate and October </v>

49
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stay tuned for that.</v>

50
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.283
<v Speaker 1>So for today's show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to jump back into the </v>

51
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:17.354
<v Speaker 1>political waters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got two comics I like and respect </v>

52
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.031
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darren,</v>

53
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Felicia Michael's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with them on some issues and,</v>

54
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.473
<v Speaker 1>disagree with them on some others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I know more than anything else </v>

56
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>though is that comedians have a way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding themselves to a high standard of</v>

57
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure will get things wrong,</v>

58
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:31.754
<v Speaker 1>but the good ones have a fearless desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say controversial things and let the </v>

59
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>chips fall where they may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Billy Wilder said,</v>

60
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:38.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to tell people the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

61
00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:39.674
<v Speaker 1>be funny or they will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say the Comedians are </v>

62
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 1>guardians of peace and justice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>

63
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Just like the Jetta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.363
<v Speaker 1>except comedians usually smoke a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All so I am with two of my favorite </v>

65
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>political comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Felicia michaels and Jimmy Dore.</v>

66
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Most of you guys probably recognize them</v>
<v Speaker 1>from our old show,</v>

67
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>but they are new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The all new Rubin report.</v>

68
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This digs.</v>

69
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a great apartment.</v>

70
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty sweet Jimmy.</v>

71
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>We have a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a camera flying around.</v>

72
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.720
<v Speaker 1>You love the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do love the gym.</v>

73
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>You want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want somebody to.</v>

74
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Comedy is 90 percent gap.</v>

75
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Ninety Percent Jib and 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyebrow raising.</v>

76
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.151
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

77
00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Well then we're in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I wanted to start,</v>

78
00:03:20.281 --> 00:03:22.650
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do all that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

79
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna do all politics.</v>

80
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.253
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go see.</v>

81
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Brought you guys on for politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys love politics.</v>

82
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.160
<v Speaker 1>So unfortunately we have to start with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>

83
00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:32.994
<v Speaker 1>I hate that we have to start this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel that we do because this is </v>

84
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:39.060
<v Speaker 1>the thing that has just consumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

85
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'll just open it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evenly.</v>

87
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of this trump?</v>

88
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.913
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that irritates me most about </v>

89
00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump is how all my liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends are freaking out.</v>

90
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.560
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always going to get his hands on</v>

91
00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:55.394
<v Speaker 3>the button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that kind of red recognition would </v>

92
00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:59.570
<v Speaker 3>you not up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way he's gonna get his hands on</v>

93
00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:01.730
<v Speaker 3>the button is if that's what his wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>calls his penis.</v>

94
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just so crazy to become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

95
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:08.520
<v Speaker 1>You have no fears that this actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be legit.</v>

96
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.553
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

97
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I think anything is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he doesn't become president and I</v>

98
00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:17.540
<v Speaker 3>mean it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are attracted to him,</v>

99
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.990
<v Speaker 3>that scares me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that he gives a voice to that.</v>

100
00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:21.890
<v Speaker 3>That's frightening.</v>

101
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll get to those people in a second</v>

102
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>because I do want to talk about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the.</v>

103
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this thing is real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for mines,</v>

104
00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:31.580
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to do three debates </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've already done two,</v>

105
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:35.280
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's going to get to three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still going to be peaking in the,</v>

106
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.163
<v Speaker 1>in the rankings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's going to say I moved the </v>

107
00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:39.080
<v Speaker 1>dial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>

108
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.080
<v Speaker 1>And then he's gonna be the attack dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>for whoever the nominee is that,</v>

109
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.690
<v Speaker 1>that's my basic prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this is real?</v>

110
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.963
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say what you want about Donald </v>

111
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does make the racism run on time.</v>

112
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.363
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do actually enjoy listening to </v>

113
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump speaks just because every </v>
<v Speaker 2>once in a while you know,</v>

114
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the mood to watch a Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

115
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>but I want to hear it delivered by Gary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Busey.</v>

116
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.120
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part Hitler par.</v>

117
00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Gary Busey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Kinda,</v>

118
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 2>that Kinda works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump.</v>

119
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:11.400
<v Speaker 2>I predicted he would go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really want to be president,</v>

120
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want you running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything.</v>

121
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to have to read up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

122
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to have to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

123
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.020
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

124
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.730
<v Speaker 1>so is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the craziest part of this?</v>

125
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.573
<v Speaker 1>Because did you see about a week ago he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on this radio show and he asked him </v>

126
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:28.320
<v Speaker 1>the difference between Hamas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hezbollah,</v>

127
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.200
<v Speaker 1>that anyone that knows anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>world politics,</v>

128
00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:32.034
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to know a lot to know that </v>

129
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 1>these are very different groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is in Gaza,</v>

130
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:36.684
<v Speaker 1>one is in Lebanon and Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he made it sound like it was a </v>

131
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

132
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:43.640
<v Speaker 1>the genius of him that every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turns everything into it.</v>

133
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:45.330
<v Speaker 1>You see what the media is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

134
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that the real genius of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

135
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.030
<v Speaker 3>not the genius thing of Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>would carry the gene,</v>

136
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.153
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think the average American </v>

137
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 3>doesn't know the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>those two factions.</v>

138
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 3>And it's complicated and everything's </v>
<v Speaker 3>intertwined.</v>

139
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.643
<v Speaker 3>It's not a Gotcha question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who's running for office should </v>

140
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:03.614
<v Speaker 3>know those answers and the fact that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>can just keep going at it and going at </v>

141
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 3>it and not taking any responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he doesn't know.</v>

142
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 3>That's frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

143
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 3>and that people don't call them out </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

144
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.971
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

145
00:06:15.971 --> 00:06:16.804
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about the people that you </v>

146
00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:19.540
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that are digging this,</v>

147
00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:23.350
<v Speaker 1>because I know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rant and rave about politics all the</v>

148
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:25.030
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hate the system,</v>

149
00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:25.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

150
00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:26.304
<v Speaker 1>I hate the system and what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are attracted to is that he's </v>

151
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.340
<v Speaker 1>calling the system out on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

152
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.520
<v Speaker 1>So should we at least grant him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much that he has.</v>

153
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in the first debate when he said,</v>

154
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:37.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I donated money to Hillary.</v>

155
00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:38.490
<v Speaker 1>So she showed up to my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>my wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

157
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.533
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should give them a little credit on </v>

158
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:42.040
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets a,</v>

160
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 2>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little credit on that,</v>

161
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 2>but you will say what the genius of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump is,</v>

162
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.883
<v Speaker 2>is that the geniuses that he knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll appeal to people who are not </v>

163
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.860
<v Speaker 2>geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

164
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.731
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

165
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 2>she's not appealing to smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Ben Carson.</v>

166
00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Ben Carson also butts butts.</v>

167
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.763
<v Speaker 2>I respect Ben Carson more than I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do Donald Trump and I don't respect </v>

168
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 2>respect Ben Carson and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

169
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 2>well there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trump's in negative territory.</v>

170
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

171
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 2>so what he's doing is he's gaining more </v>
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>

172
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.783
<v Speaker 2>Ben Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ironically with racists but not </v>

173
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 2>getting support with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurosurgeons.</v>

174
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:17.744
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that interesting?</v>

175
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

176
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Well first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Ben Carson real quick.</v>

177
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:21.994
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can a neurosurgeon not believe in </v>

178
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:24.360
<v Speaker 1>evolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

179
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be a warrant to take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>license away?</v>

180
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.993
<v Speaker 3>The stuff that he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said a couple of weeks ago that the </v>

181
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 3>number one killer of African Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>are abortions.</v>

182
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.793
<v Speaker 3>And when he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally was like our cops giving </v>

183
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 3>abortions and crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so insane.</v>

184
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.693
<v Speaker 1>What do we do with this whole group?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said in the intro to this thing </v>

185
00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:50.430
<v Speaker 1>that I went to the gop debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a couple of these guys.</v>

186
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:51.264
<v Speaker 1>I think casick is sorta a decent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Marco Rubio is at least in the </v>

187
00:07:54.901 --> 00:07:55.734
<v Speaker 1>right line of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I disagree with him on a lot of </v>

188
00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:58.374
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think about trump's </v>

189
00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:00.894
<v Speaker 1>place in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me they all seem like </v>

190
00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Speaker 1>children that can't get the attention of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dad,</v>

191
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seems to be dead.</v>

192
00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:08.420
<v Speaker 1>That's getting all the attention and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids can't.</v>

193
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to his supporters.</v>

194
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

195
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm there for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are,</v>

196
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.920
<v Speaker 2>it's like when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said Carly Fiorina's face,</v>

197
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.763
<v Speaker 2>you can't have that face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then his poll numbers went up with </v>

198
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:24.730
<v Speaker 2>women who hate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

199
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's really what's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

200
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:28.894
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people don't say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream news media won't call him </v>

201
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:31.864
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say his controversial comments </v>

202
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:35.860
<v Speaker 2>on immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

203
00:08:35.861 --> 00:08:38.500
<v Speaker 2>and they won't call them fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what this is,</v>

204
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:39.490
<v Speaker 2>what it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

205
00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:41.860
<v Speaker 2>So they're charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're popular,</v>

206
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.813
<v Speaker 2>they demonize the immigrants and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with no money and no power as </v>

207
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:50.800
<v Speaker 2>being the problem right there over </v>
<v Speaker 2>overly nativist are naturally strong.</v>

208
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's,</v>

209
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 2>he's got all those 14 hallmark and </v>
<v Speaker 2>misogyny is a big and fascist,</v>

210
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regimes,</v>

211
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:58.224
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in their culture and he's pushing </v>

212
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:00.380
<v Speaker 2>them aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jainism.</v>

213
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.223
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if that's a word and </v>

214
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 2>that sounded like a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's amazing.</v>

215
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:06.054
<v Speaker 2>So what we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say it here and I say it on my </v>

216
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

217
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 2>that this is what fashion that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

218
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did Hitler happen?</v>

219
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave a good speech.</v>

220
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.733
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have to appeal to that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and that's exactly what Donald </v>

221
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Trump is.</v>

222
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>So that really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is just a show,</v>

223
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:20.574
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to me this is the ultimate reality </v>

224
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that at the end of the day,</v>

225
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>is that really what's happened?</v>

226
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

227
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.623
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I want to say about when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched Donald Trump is the makeup </v>

228
00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:34.690
<v Speaker 3>that he has on his face and I'm being </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely serious.</v>

229
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:35.563
<v Speaker 3>He's had three baby mamas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all are all gorgeous women that </v>

230
00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:38.954
<v Speaker 3>know how to apply makeup and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he doesn't turn to his wife or one </v>

231
00:09:42.441 --> 00:09:45.380
<v Speaker 3>of the former baby mamas and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think this is too much orange?</v>

232
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:46.214
<v Speaker 3>Too much wine under the ice says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a person that doesn't give a </v>

233
00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:51.800
<v Speaker 3>shit about anyone else's opinion or </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't care.</v>

234
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious,</v>

235
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 3>really serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me as,</v>

236
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.560
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a silly woman that I am,</v>

237
00:09:57.561 --> 00:09:58.394
<v Speaker 3>I'm all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with that guy </v>

238
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Speaker 3>that he can't turn to his woman and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>

239
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 3>What's going to be able to do that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>any subject?</v>

240
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.300
<v Speaker 2>He can't turn to his woman because she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

241
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.620
<v Speaker 2>his women are anchor wives.</v>

242
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Last thought I'd him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

243
00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:11.104
<v Speaker 1>is there something really </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically sort of void in someone </v>

244
00:10:14.951 --> 00:10:19.880
<v Speaker 1>that's answer to everything is they love</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I'm going to show you why</v>

245
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.753
<v Speaker 2>I look forward to Donald Trump's next </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech where he called another group of </v>

246
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Speaker 2>people rapists and then ends up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they love it,</v>

247
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.800
<v Speaker 1>but they love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

248
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.070
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

249
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.960
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's move on to the other one,</v>

250
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.130
<v Speaker 1>which the other big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Hillary and to me it seems like</v>

251
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.993
<v Speaker 1>Hillary is running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the worst campaign probably in </v>

252
00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>modern history and forget the email </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and the,</v>

253
00:10:41.631 --> 00:10:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inaccessibility of the press.</v>

254
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.713
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be just no sort of joy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity or sense of who she is or any </v>

255
00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:50.870
<v Speaker 1>of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you guys with me on that?</v>

256
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:51.704
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about the campaign </v>

257
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:53.260
<v Speaker 1>itself?</v>

258
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.430
<v Speaker 2>You are correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave.</v>

259
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.400
<v Speaker 2>It is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's at the beginning of the summer she</v>

260
00:10:57.401 --> 00:10:58.234
<v Speaker 2>said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

261
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.690
<v Speaker 2>nobody stands up for progressive values </v>
<v Speaker 2>a stronger than she does.</v>

262
00:11:01.691 --> 00:11:02.740
<v Speaker 2>And then just the other day she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

263
00:11:02.741 --> 00:11:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm a centrist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's bragging that she's,</v>

264
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.270
<v Speaker 2>that's what's wrong with the countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>knucklehead is that the center has moved</v>

265
00:11:10.271 --> 00:11:12.610
<v Speaker 2>to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now when you say you're a centrist,</v>

266
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you're actually a Republican from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>

267
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:16.061
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

268
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:16.894
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why Bernie Sanders had such </v>

269
00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:21.250
<v Speaker 2>traction and that's why she's doing such</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad job.</v>

270
00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:22.084
<v Speaker 2>But I will say that the email thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just goes to prove you because they </v>

271
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:25.934
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just came out and said that there </v>

272
00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:28.600
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't commit a crime,</v>

273
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.463
<v Speaker 2>it will haunt you.</v>

274
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've said.</v>

275
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.473
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the State Department has said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she actually didn't send any </v>

276
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.553
<v Speaker 1>classified emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to believe at this </v>

277
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:38.804
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me the whole thing is sort of </v>

278
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:40.664
<v Speaker 1>nonsensical because one day we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have a point where the </v>

279
00:11:43.881 --> 00:11:44.714
<v Speaker 1>politicians just won't use email or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't use any electronic communication </v>

280
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.210
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to do all their bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit by just talking to people.</v>

281
00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:50.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

282
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.770
<v Speaker 1>so to make it about the emails itself is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

283
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

284
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the wound,</v>

285
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>not really what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the underlying problem?</v>

286
00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think necessarily that she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>running a terrible campaign.</v>

287
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.893
<v Speaker 3>It could be a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when we were talking earlier in </v>

288
00:12:05.001 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 3>the green room and you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does she stand for?</v>

289
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.713
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a great point because</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one knows what does she specifically </v>

290
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.550
<v Speaker 3>stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

291
00:12:13.551 --> 00:12:14.341
<v Speaker 3>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

292
00:12:14.341 --> 00:12:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how's that Democrats?</v>

293
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.050
<v Speaker 3>But how is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one thing where you were like,</v>

294
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.160
<v Speaker 3>what is Hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

295
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 3>you can't name one thing that she likes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

296
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think you generally,</v>

297
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 1>you basically like her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

299
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 3>I do like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was telling him earlier,</v>

300
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:26.434
<v Speaker 3>I have a picture of the Gig 15 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Hillary and me and the backstage and </v>

301
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want her to be president for that</v>

302
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:32.524
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a funny answer to the </v>

303
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:35.374
<v Speaker 3>seriousness of the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is she's had so much bad news </v>

304
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.933
<v Speaker 3>over the past two or three months on </v>
<v Speaker 3>headlines about Bengazi all the time </v>

305
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:44.314
<v Speaker 3>about those emails and it's just insane </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much people in America don't want </v>

306
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 3>its establishment candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the problem with her is she's</v>

307
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:56.920
<v Speaker 3>too establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

308
00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 3>That's why Donald Trump is doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why Bernie Sanders is doing good.</v>

309
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 3>People want something different.</v>

310
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to get to Bernie in a sec,</v>

311
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:05.330
<v Speaker 1>but I think you hit on something with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

312
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.193
<v Speaker 1>with the establishment and the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that the media loves </v>

313
00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:10.820
<v Speaker 1>trump because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of what we said earlier this off</v>

314
00:13:10.821 --> 00:13:11.654
<v Speaker 1>the prompter thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary is completely scripted and I </v>

315
00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:15.164
<v Speaker 1>also think the media is sort of digging </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that Hillary has been around </v>

316
00:13:18.561 --> 00:13:19.394
<v Speaker 1>for so long and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's always had this back and forth </v>

317
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.113
<v Speaker 1>with the media and I think they love </v>
<v Speaker 1>just attacking her that in no way as a </v>

318
00:13:26.361 --> 00:13:29.240
<v Speaker 1>defense of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how much is just that the media just</v>

319
00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:32.840
<v Speaker 1>loves a narrative and now it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take down this woman.</v>

320
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is exactly what you know.</v>

321
00:13:34.941 --> 00:13:35.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

322
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I want to defend Hillary </v>

323
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be,</v>

324
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.983
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to in this situation because </v>

325
00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:43.284
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times just had like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fricken vendetta against her over these </v>

326
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.770
<v Speaker 2>and the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing.</v>

327
00:13:46.771 --> 00:13:48.990
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk about email Hank Paulson,</v>

328
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.160
<v Speaker 2>who was the secretary of the treasury </v>
<v Speaker 2>when everything went belly up,</v>

329
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.790
<v Speaker 2>right when the whole thing cratered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never even used the males.</v>

330
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that's my booze email.</v>

331
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what your point is,</v>

332
00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:01.291
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

333
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:02.124
<v Speaker 2>let's make a bigger deal out of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>emails and no one will put anything in </v>

334
00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:05.220
<v Speaker 2>an email that's important.</v>

335
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.051
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

336
00:14:06.051 --> 00:14:08.180
<v Speaker 1>we know that even when you lie under </v>
<v Speaker 1>oath,</v>

337
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.530
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

338
00:14:09.531 --> 00:14:11.920
<v Speaker 1>like James Clapper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the head of the CIA and they,</v>

339
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.990
<v Speaker 1>they asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we doing this mass data collection?</v>

340
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And he said not wittingly as he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratching the top of his head,</v>

341
00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 1>because that's where you scratch when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your lie.</v>

342
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.970
<v Speaker 1>So we know that even when you lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

343
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.160
<v Speaker 1>like they're not going to really do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

344
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 3>It makes me laugh because pottery barn </v>
<v Speaker 3>does mass data collection mean everybody</v>

345
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:30.080
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

346
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.880
<v Speaker 1>They know what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have in your kitchen.</v>

347
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 3>They do know what I have in mind.</v>

348
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

349
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:34.843
<v Speaker 1>So let's move on to Bernie because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the one that I think we should be </v>

350
00:14:37.401 --> 00:14:38.234
<v Speaker 1>talking about more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been trying to talk about him </v>

351
00:14:39.771 --> 00:14:40.610
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

352
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I think he's talking about the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

353
00:14:42.711 --> 00:14:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Income inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge problem.</v>

354
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.540
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about money and politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which nobody's talking about.</v>

355
00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:49.430
<v Speaker 1>As I told you guys earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the gop debate.</v>

356
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.413
<v Speaker 1>I literally think I might've been only </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that asked anyone in that room </v>

357
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 1>about money in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked Scott Walker.</v>

358
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>He went out of the race two days later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

359
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.143
<v Speaker 1>that tells you something.</v>

360
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.623
<v Speaker 2>So that goes back to your earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>question about Donald Trump deserves </v>

361
00:15:03.151 --> 00:15:05.070
<v Speaker 2>credit for bringing up this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

362
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:05.904
<v Speaker 2>he does expose the cravenness and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the emptiness of the political </v>

363
00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:10.560
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

364
00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

365
00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the complete corruption of the political</v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

366
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.740
<v Speaker 2>but then no reporter ever says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

367
00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:19.020
<v Speaker 2>what's your plan to fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever says,</v>

368
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.861
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was great.</v>

369
00:15:19.861 --> 00:15:20.694
<v Speaker 2>That way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You showed everybody how you buy all </v>

370
00:15:21.811 --> 00:15:23.700
<v Speaker 2>these guys on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your plan to fix that?</v>

371
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he doesn't know.</v>

372
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.370
<v Speaker 2>So he's also at the same time revealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the corruption in the political process.</v>

373
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.040
<v Speaker 2>He's revealing the corruption and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>news media.</v>

374
00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:32.791
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the news,</v>

375
00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:33.624
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Todd had him on and he asked them </v>

376
00:15:34.891 --> 00:15:36.210
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

377
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.310
<v Speaker 2>And he started out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was just Sunday,</v>

378
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.323
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

379
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say that you don't have to respond </v>

380
00:15:42.361 --> 00:15:44.370
<v Speaker 2>to everybody who says something and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with you on that.</v>

381
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.550
<v Speaker 2>That's how he started his question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he just interrupt.</v>

382
00:15:47.551 --> 00:15:48.384
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Todd just interviewed Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the biggest gap that you could </v>

383
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:52.800
<v Speaker 2>ever imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

384
00:15:52.801 --> 00:15:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Some guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it let's round up Muslims.</v>

385
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.703
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president of Muslim and trump says </v>

386
00:15:56.941 --> 00:15:58.800
<v Speaker 2>yes to both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Todd,</v>

387
00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:00.990
<v Speaker 2>the number one political reporter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America has them on the show,</v>

388
00:16:00.991 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 2>doesn't lay a fucking glove on them or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can delay.</v>

389
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.901
<v Speaker 2>And then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

390
00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:07.734
<v Speaker 2>thanks for having Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says it was a pleasure and didn't know </v>

391
00:16:09.571 --> 00:16:11.010
<v Speaker 2>what Chuck Todd says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Bet.</v>

392
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he said.</v>

393
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.180
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's wrong with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go,</v>

394
00:16:15.181 --> 00:16:15.541
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

395
00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.210
<v Speaker 2>why do we have the biggest income </v>
<v Speaker 2>disparities since the gilded age?</v>

396
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.193
<v Speaker 2>Why do we only have five major media </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations in America when they used </v>

397
00:16:21.661 --> 00:16:24.590
<v Speaker 2>to be 50 and 1980?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we get the straight dope?</v>

398
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.433
<v Speaker 2>Why does when we nationalize the banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody calls it that and that's because </v>

399
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.720
<v Speaker 2>they're all bought and paid for by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same people.</v>

400
00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Read manufacturing because.</v>

401
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.440
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think your answer,</v>

402
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.330
<v Speaker 1>the original question was what about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie?</v>

403
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:38.164
<v Speaker 1>And I think it got there in a long way </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he is talking about those </v>

404
00:16:42.521 --> 00:16:44.680
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically do you think that the media</v>

405
00:16:44.681 --> 00:16:47.320
<v Speaker 1>just has a vested interest in really not</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing him?</v>

406
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.303
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day a Bernie and trump were </v>

407
00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>both giving speeches at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even MSNBC,</v>

408
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.530
<v Speaker 1>which you'd think would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:16:56.531 --> 00:16:59.020
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to lean forward or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess they did until two months ago.</v>

410
00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know that they lean </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards or I'm not sure,</v>

411
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.600
<v Speaker 1>but even they were covering trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of covering Bernie.</v>

412
00:17:04.601 --> 00:17:05.434
<v Speaker 1>So can it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can an outsider like Bernie ever really </v>

413
00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:07.650
<v Speaker 1>win</v>

414
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 3>if he is a little bit more fun?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seriously the answer why people love</v>

415
00:17:13.381 --> 00:17:16.410
<v Speaker 3>trump because he's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can make fun of them.</v>

416
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.360
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't hurt his feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

417
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:22.240
<v Speaker 3>and he is out of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when it comes to Bernie like they,</v>

418
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.840
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to start putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>him on the tonight show,</v>

419
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.610
<v Speaker 3>drinking wine with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

420
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Well I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a promo.</v>

422
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.320
<v Speaker 1>He did a promo for the nightly show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said on fleek,</v>

423
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.750
<v Speaker 1>which you've ever heard Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 1>say on fleek,</v>

424
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:36.290
<v Speaker 1>it was actually pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

425
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.133
<v Speaker 1>but yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much of that is it that he's the </v>

426
00:17:38.351 --> 00:17:41.680
<v Speaker 1>outsider guy so he should be getting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>

427
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.470
<v Speaker 1>the first time Obama went around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should be getting that excitement.</v>

428
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.910
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Bernie himself,</v>

429
00:17:45.911 --> 00:17:49.210
<v Speaker 1>he's a 70 something year old white guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

430
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.600
<v Speaker 1>He's not that exciting and sadly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comb,</v>

431
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

432
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.973
<v Speaker 1>you should shave the sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really like how much is </v>

433
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:01.060
<v Speaker 1>just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe his person sadly in,</v>

434
00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:01.894
<v Speaker 1>in 2015 in America that his personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't match up in the way we want to </v>

435
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>vote for somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way his rhetoric,</v>

436
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 1>which I think a lot of people agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

437
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny that he,</v>

438
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.133
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the big outsider on the left and </v>

439
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.490
<v Speaker 2>trump is the big outsider on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them spend zero time on their</v>

440
00:18:19.491 --> 00:18:23.510
<v Speaker 2>hair and one of them here I would like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to ask Donald Trump,</v>

441
00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:24.344
<v Speaker 2>does he have a long form birth </v>
<v Speaker 2>certificate for that fucking hairpiece </v>

442
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.150
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that thing definitely was not born in</v>

443
00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:29.984
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one thing he talked about what you </v>

444
00:18:31.491 --> 00:18:32.324
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even even msnbc wasn't covering </v>

445
00:18:34.101 --> 00:18:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

446
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:35.653
<v Speaker 2>Well let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Msnbc is not a liberal </v>

447
00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:39.350
<v Speaker 2>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a corporation by the way,</v>

448
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.250
<v Speaker 2>through the whole Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC was owned by General Electric,</v>

449
00:18:43.251 --> 00:18:44.084
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge defense contractor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the lefties were left getting their </v>

450
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.990
<v Speaker 2>antiwar message from a fucking defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>contractor,</v>

451
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.023
<v Speaker 2>which is why they fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled down to you because he was </v>

452
00:18:51.111 --> 00:18:53.030
<v Speaker 2>against the war and they kept grits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matthews.</v>

453
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.280
<v Speaker 2>And then they also just fired Ed Schultz</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's against the tpt and comcast</v>

454
00:18:57.281 --> 00:18:59.090
<v Speaker 2>is all for the dpt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

455
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I already said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not liberal.</v>

456
00:19:00.861 --> 00:19:03.920
<v Speaker 2>As soon as Rachel maddow says something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that costs comcast's money,</v>

457
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.813
<v Speaker 2>they will fire her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just an embarrassment to her </v>

458
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:08.150
<v Speaker 2>that they haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

459
00:19:08.151 --> 00:19:10.400
<v Speaker 2>for the record or a has told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say anything I want.</v>

460
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.110
<v Speaker 2>It's all a fencer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>

461
00:19:12.111 --> 00:19:12.944
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it shouldn't be the fairest went </v>

462
00:19:13.641 --> 00:19:15.860
<v Speaker 2>to them and if you watch the channel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I do,</v>

463
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you see that they're corporatists </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

464
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Especially Chris Hayes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's couldn't be worse.</v>

465
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

466
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 1>so my last thought on this is does he </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any chance?</v>

467
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Does Bernie have any chance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

468
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 1>my feeling is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

469
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:29.860
<v Speaker 1>and I know people are going to give me </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit for saying that because if they'll,</v>

470
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say no,</v>

471
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.453
<v Speaker 1>that causes people to get depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and then they're not gonna </v>

472
00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:35.244
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just unfortunately I think that it's </v>

473
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:40.170
<v Speaker 1>very clear to me that the party is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not going to back him.</v>

474
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:41.004
<v Speaker 1>They simply will not back him and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people are talking about Biden </v>

475
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:44.843
<v Speaker 1>because I think hillary probably will </v>
<v Speaker 1>flame out and they're gonna go with </v>

476
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:48.624
<v Speaker 1>Biden and it's like you guys are the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>party that hosts lot of minorities and </v>

477
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:54.290
<v Speaker 1>women and everything else and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to pick the VP who.</v>

478
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Just another old white guy.</v>

479
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.343
<v Speaker 2>Why Dante embrace Martin is because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>is an independent and he railed so hard </v>

480
00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:01.630
<v Speaker 2>against both Democrats.</v>

481
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I think they genuinely think he won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>

482
00:20:03.651 --> 00:20:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think he can't,</v>

483
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.380
<v Speaker 1>that are liberal for someone that far on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left from the northeast,</v>

484
00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:10.880
<v Speaker 1>just can't win the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

485
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it bring us home.</v>

486
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:12.891
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

487
00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:13.724
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Party hasn't rallied around Bernie is </v>

488
00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:17.674
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not in bed with the big money </v>

489
00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:22.720
<v Speaker 2>donors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they read the Democratic Party no</v>

490
00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:25.960
<v Speaker 2>longer responds to their voters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only respond to their donors.</v>

491
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.870
<v Speaker 2>And so their donors are telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of this guy,</v>

492
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get rid of that guy somehow.</v>

493
00:20:30.971 --> 00:20:31.804
<v Speaker 2>They don't want the donors want nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with Bernie because they can't </v>

494
00:20:33.281 --> 00:20:35.170
<v Speaker 2>control them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like the donors don't want anything</v>

495
00:20:35.171 --> 00:20:36.910
<v Speaker 2>to do with Donald Trump because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't control him.</v>

496
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.010
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very much alike.</v>

497
00:20:39.011 --> 00:20:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do live in a banana republic,</v>

498
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.170
<v Speaker 2>like we don't really have a responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

499
00:20:44.171 --> 00:20:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sandy Hook taught us anything.</v>

500
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.073
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent of the people in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted some kind of gun legislation and </v>

501
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 2>we didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll no longer do our representatives</v>

502
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:53.314
<v Speaker 2>represent our interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only represent the donors and </v>

503
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:57.910
<v Speaker 2>that's why Bernie is winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why he gets 30,000</v>

504
00:20:57.911 --> 00:20:59.200
<v Speaker 2>people when he shows up to speak.</v>

505
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.980
<v Speaker 1>That's how you have to segment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

506
00:21:00.981 --> 00:21:03.710
<v Speaker 1>So how do you guys think we can make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>debates better?</v>

507
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Because I've watched both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

508
00:21:05.601 --> 00:21:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I went to the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

509
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.183
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted on the first debate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>technically these things have not even </v>

510
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.104
<v Speaker 1>been debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A debate is where they present an idea </v>

511
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.930
<v Speaker 1>and then two or more people go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth on these same ideas.</v>

512
00:21:17.931 --> 00:21:18.764
<v Speaker 1>But basically what we've seen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderators ask people questions catered </v>

513
00:21:23.001 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 1>to them so that they can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their things.</v>

514
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:26.194
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a jake tapper would focus with Lindsey </v>

515
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Graham on foreign policy because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy guy,</v>

516
00:21:31.521 --> 00:21:33.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a debate.</v>

517
00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:34.980
<v Speaker 1>That's just sort of lobbying up </v>
<v Speaker 1>softball.</v>

518
00:21:34.981 --> 00:21:38.030
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think we can do to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things better?</v>

519
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:38.993
<v Speaker 3>I'm back to let's make it fun and </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining and do it like the voice </v>

520
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.900
<v Speaker 3>comes on and you got three minutes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>

521
00:21:45.901 --> 00:21:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wolf Blitzer,</v>

522
00:21:47.101 --> 00:21:47.934
<v Speaker 3>they all have their back to them and as </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon as he says one thing that they </v>

523
00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:52.200
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they turn around and he's in.</v>

524
00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.410
<v Speaker 1>That's actually not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you mask the voices,</v>

525
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise they'll know.</v>

526
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:56.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

527
00:21:56.781 --> 00:21:58.880
<v Speaker 1>That's just not the worst idea I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>

528
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.923
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

529
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last debate which was on CNN was </v>

530
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:04.144
<v Speaker 2>fantastic because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of getting a journalist to </v>

531
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 2>moderate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hired Eddie Haskell.</v>

532
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 2>He just kept trying to forgive anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pick fights with each other.</v>

533
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Now Donald Trump said that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly.</v>

534
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:16.594
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to say to him?</v>

535
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.080
<v Speaker 1>So you're not jake tapper guys that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me?</v>

536
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

537
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.210
<v Speaker 2>that was probably the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

538
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Jake Tapper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

539
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.303
<v Speaker 2>he just announced that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be start doing fact checking of </v>

540
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:27.154
<v Speaker 2>politicians with the factcheck.org</v>
<v Speaker 2>because apparently at cnn they don't </v>

541
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:32.044
<v Speaker 2>know how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had to hire an outside </v>

542
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:37.120
<v Speaker 2>organization to teach them how to fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>check at CNN.</v>

543
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm jake tapper.</v>

544
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:39.304
<v Speaker 2>Staff really knows what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that is and why there was no </v>

545
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:45.670
<v Speaker 2>real questions and why there was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>followup.</v>

546
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.563
<v Speaker 2>There was no candy Crowley moment at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this debate where they corrected carly </v>

547
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:50.643
<v Speaker 2>Fiorina for being a crazy person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying blatant lies about planned </v>

548
00:22:53.411 --> 00:22:54.244
<v Speaker 2>parenthood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they reason they don't do that </v>

549
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:59.350
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want to alienate any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the viewers that like these people.</v>

550
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 2>So what they'll do is they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

551
00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Jeb Bush said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump said that.</v>

552
00:23:03.161 --> 00:23:04.480
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to say to him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of saying,</v>

553
00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the facts are this,</v>

554
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.040
<v Speaker 2>and you said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you don't do that?</v>

555
00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 2>So they're not doing journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing Eddie Haskell,</v>

556
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.990
<v Speaker 2>ISM and they're trying to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick fights with each other.</v>

557
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do agree with you,</v>

558
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:16.483
<v Speaker 3>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that question needed to be asked to </v>

559
00:23:18.321 --> 00:23:19.154
<v Speaker 3>Carla feared the quest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the face thing that needed to be asked </v>

560
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.570
<v Speaker 3>about trump saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

561
00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 3>calling her out on her looks or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

562
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:28.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is so terrible that it needed to be</v>

563
00:23:28.251 --> 00:23:28.680
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

564
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.513
<v Speaker 1>So I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to be addressed because it was </v>

565
00:23:31.021 --> 00:23:34.770
<v Speaker 1>just another absurdly misogynistic thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trump did,</v>

566
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.113
<v Speaker 1>but interestingly doesn't that then get </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of the play the next day then </v>

567
00:23:39.211 --> 00:23:43.860
<v Speaker 1>anything that might be more important </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as foreign policy or immigration.</v>

568
00:23:43.861 --> 00:23:44.694
<v Speaker 1>I mean really can you think of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>headline the next day that was related </v>

569
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 1>to policy?</v>

570
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:49.873
<v Speaker 3>Important things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's important how a person who is </v>

571
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 3>running for president is treating the </v>
<v Speaker 3>women of this country.</v>

572
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that totally is as important.</v>

573
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

574
00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.193
<v Speaker 2>I totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the GLP did make it clear that they </v>

575
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.103
<v Speaker 2>welcome all women into the gop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the ones who make Donald Trump </v>

576
00:24:04.811 --> 00:24:05.644
<v Speaker 2>wins.</v>

577
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.033
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we haven't had a democratic debate </v>

578
00:24:10.681 --> 00:24:12.930
<v Speaker 1>yet where you have one in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks in Vegas,</v>

579
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said that about Bernie segment,</v>

580
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.150
<v Speaker 1>you know the Democrats were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the big party.</v>

581
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what everyone says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be the big party,</v>

582
00:24:19.801 --> 00:24:22.890
<v Speaker 1>but they've really only got two people </v>
<v Speaker 1>running for all intents and purposes.</v>

583
00:24:22.891 --> 00:24:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and Bernie,</v>

584
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.400
<v Speaker 1>and then there's Jim Webb and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>o'malley.</v>

585
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

586
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's really only two people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's talking about.</v>

587
00:24:29.611 --> 00:24:30.444
<v Speaker 1>So should we give the Republicans a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little credit for at least they have 20 </v>

588
00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:34.644
<v Speaker 1>clowns in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clown car while in the democratic clown </v>

589
00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:37.860
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really only two people.</v>

590
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.053
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin O'malley did come out last week </v>

591
00:24:40.531 --> 00:24:42.270
<v Speaker 2>with a bold proposal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

592
00:24:42.271 --> 00:24:45.120
<v Speaker 2>raise the age of gun ownership to 21 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

593
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.220
<v Speaker 2>and everybody responded by saying who </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck?</v>

594
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.630
<v Speaker 1>But that's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

595
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call something crazy here.</v>

596
00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that that guy who's polling at </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative 60,</v>

597
00:24:55.241 --> 00:24:56.074
<v Speaker 1>that nobody knows who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he has a little bit of a chance </v>

598
00:24:58.901 --> 00:24:59.734
<v Speaker 1>here because I think they're all going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get equal footing and people are so </v>

599
00:25:01.721 --> 00:25:03.430
<v Speaker 1>sick of Hillary on the debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

600
00:25:03.431 --> 00:25:05.100
<v Speaker 1>and I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he'd bring him,</v>

601
00:25:05.101 --> 00:25:07.930
<v Speaker 1>he's a good looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle aged guy and I and I think he's a</v>

602
00:25:07.931 --> 00:25:10.390
<v Speaker 1>pretty decent guy and I think people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly going to go,</v>

603
00:25:10.391 --> 00:25:11.230
<v Speaker 1>who the hell is this guy?</v>

604
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.250
<v Speaker 2>The irony is that it was Howard Dean </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

605
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.413
<v Speaker 2>whose idea was to limit the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic debates because he saw what </v>

606
00:25:17.881 --> 00:25:18.714
<v Speaker 2>happened with all the Republican debates</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time and how they ate each other </v>

607
00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:22.374
<v Speaker 2>and how it was just a clown show and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't want that to happen with the </v>

608
00:25:25.111 --> 00:25:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they made them limit them,</v>

609
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:27.990
<v Speaker 2>but now we realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

610
00:25:27.991 --> 00:25:31.290
<v Speaker 2>there's actually going to be a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate now so maybe we should do more of</v>

611
00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:35.430
<v Speaker 2>these because this is just free </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertising for the Republican Party and</v>

612
00:25:35.431 --> 00:25:36.264
<v Speaker 2>we're not getting ready for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats and people still don't know </v>

613
00:25:37.681 --> 00:25:38.850
<v Speaker 2>where Bernie Sanders is.</v>

614
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what can,</v>

615
00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:43.150
<v Speaker 1>what can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got the election is over a year away,</v>

616
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.013
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do to make these debates </v>

617
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.560
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as the people,</v>

618
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:51.310
<v Speaker 1>like do we have to demand that they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be done on pbs?</v>

619
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:52.144
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's going to be any </v>

620
00:25:52.901 --> 00:25:55.030
<v Speaker 1>of this upcoming year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for years ago some of them were done</v>

621
00:25:55.031 --> 00:25:56.380
<v Speaker 1>at pbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean something.</v>

622
00:25:56.381 --> 00:25:59.590
<v Speaker 1>How do we get it out of the Gotcha thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the.</v>

623
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Does carly have a wrinkle</v>

624
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.550
<v Speaker 3>on a face now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

625
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.433
<v Speaker 3>The answer for that as.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is going to be interesting to </v>

626
00:26:05.861 --> 00:26:09.160
<v Speaker 3>finally see Bernie and Hillary go at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

627
00:26:09.161 --> 00:26:13.030
<v Speaker 3>but how do you make it more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe they need to have someone like</v>

628
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.390
<v Speaker 3>at the Oscars who did the little clips </v>
<v Speaker 3>always beforehand.</v>

629
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.630
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To billy crystal come in and write.</v>

630
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know or I mean what do you.</v>

631
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.143
<v Speaker 2>It used to be that the League of women </v>
<v Speaker 2>voters used to organize the baits and </v>

632
00:26:26.731 --> 00:26:29.670
<v Speaker 2>other people use it and then they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart and they were like,</v>

633
00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:31.950
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't let other people choose.</v>

634
00:26:31.951 --> 00:26:33.960
<v Speaker 2>The people are going to ask us </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

635
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.913
<v Speaker 2>We want to control everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they created this presidential </v>

636
00:26:38.191 --> 00:26:41.460
<v Speaker 2>commission on debates and now so now </v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't any more.</v>

637
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>We League of women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's all controlling everything,</v>

638
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:45.440
<v Speaker 2>which is why they suck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

639
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.313
<v Speaker 2>So somebody has to stand up like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>women or some other big organizations </v>

640
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:50.851
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

641
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:51.684
<v Speaker 2>we want to have our own debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Naacp members saying we're </v>

642
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:55.074
<v Speaker 2>going to have our own debate at our </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and we were inviting people and </v>

643
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 2>then it'll be telling who doesn't show </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

644
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the way they should do it.</v>

645
00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.443
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately we know that the parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parties won't back that they will </v>

646
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.340
<v Speaker 1>because they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Bernie Sanders is show up.</v>

647
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.320
<v Speaker 1>He'll show up and he'll do it a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

648
00:27:08.321 --> 00:27:09.154
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

649
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.023
<v Speaker 1>So let's move on to what I think was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big elephant in the room or </v>

650
00:27:12.251 --> 00:27:13.660
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

651
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Dore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant of it.</v>

652
00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.160
<v Speaker 1>The money in politics thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

653
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.343
<v Speaker 1>seems pretty obvious to me that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple like real issues in America </v>

654
00:27:23.621 --> 00:27:24.454
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The money in politics that's ruined our </v>

655
00:27:25.271 --> 00:27:26.800
<v Speaker 1>political system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got,</v>

656
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness run amok,</v>

657
00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but nobody talked about money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

658
00:27:31.991 --> 00:27:32.824
<v Speaker 1>As I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I might've been the only person </v>

659
00:27:33.671 --> 00:27:37.180
<v Speaker 1>to ask them a question on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we not talk?</v>

660
00:27:37.181 --> 00:27:41.050
<v Speaker 1>We did talk about it wasn't near Mccain </v>
<v Speaker 1>Feingold thing 10 years ago.</v>

661
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.630
<v Speaker 1>We used to sorta talk about it every now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again.</v>

662
00:27:43.631 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Nobody talks about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

663
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.983
<v Speaker 3>Talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand how we allow people </v>

664
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:49.344
<v Speaker 3>to run for president as a candidate when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still owe money from the last time </v>

665
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:53.874
<v Speaker 3>they tried.</v>

666
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.253
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Hillary might be in debt still </v>

667
00:27:57.521 --> 00:27:58.570
<v Speaker 1>from the previous thing.</v>

668
00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.360
<v Speaker 3>If you owe money from the last time you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't get elected done,</v>

669
00:28:01.361 --> 00:28:03.580
<v Speaker 3>you can't run this time until you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid everybody off.</v>

670
00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:08.710
<v Speaker 3>It is striking in outrageous at people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't mention it or talk about it.</v>

671
00:28:08.711 --> 00:28:10.470
<v Speaker 3>I think it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>

672
00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.100
<v Speaker 3>That's the only answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

673
00:28:12.101 --> 00:28:13.810
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you fix that though?</v>

674
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:14.890
<v Speaker 3>How do you fix that?</v>

675
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.823
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did notice that when I asked some of </v>

676
00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:19.250
<v Speaker 1>the campaign people this and even when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked Scott Walker,</v>

677
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.443
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just link a couple of words to get </v>

678
00:28:21.921 --> 00:28:22.754
<v Speaker 1>there to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a sentence and then you move on </v>

679
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.183
<v Speaker 1>because they know they're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be asked this and they know no one </v>

680
00:28:26.991 --> 00:28:27.824
<v Speaker 1>cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I really realized that when </v>

681
00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I asked them that there was a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

682
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.740
<v Speaker 1>that stupid question like nobody cares </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

683
00:28:33.741 --> 00:28:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Asked me the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asked me that question,</v>

684
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

685
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.850
<v Speaker 1>so what do we do about that?</v>

686
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we a wolf-pack.com,</v>

687
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how we,</v>

688
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:43.853
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of orders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the organization I'm a part of </v>

689
00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:46.194
<v Speaker 2>that helps get money out of politics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have to do is you have to pass </v>

690
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 2>a constitutional amendment right to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>money out of politics.</v>

691
00:28:53.341 --> 00:28:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

692
00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you said she's in favor of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't.</v>

693
00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:57.871
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be,</v>

694
00:28:57.871 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 2>that's good to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

695
00:28:59.041 --> 00:28:59.874
<v Speaker 2>the Senate also in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress also passed a resolution to </v>

696
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 2>open debate on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good thing.</v>

697
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.440
<v Speaker 2>And three states has since we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to push this,</v>

698
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I've already passed the California being</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them,</v>

699
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Illinois and I think we have a New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hampshire,</v>

700
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Vermont.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

701
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.220
<v Speaker 2>so that's what you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to get the states,</v>

702
00:29:17.221 --> 00:29:18.054
<v Speaker 2>you have to go at the state level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have much less controlled for </v>

703
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:21.930
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason on the state capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

704
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.450
<v Speaker 2>So we can make an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's my big solution.</v>

705
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:26.430
<v Speaker 2>We have to get money and you can't fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

706
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Why are we still debate in climate </v>
<v Speaker 2>change?</v>

707
00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Because big money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

708
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Why are we still debating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should we drill in the Arctic because of</v>

709
00:29:34.161 --> 00:29:35.050
<v Speaker 2>big money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

710
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Why are we still bombing nonstop for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years in the middle of the big money?</v>

711
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.290
<v Speaker 1>So is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really the crux of that.</v>

712
00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:42.124
<v Speaker 1>The reason we can't get the public to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>ginned up enough to care is because </v>

713
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:47.314
<v Speaker 1>they're getting their information from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very people who are paying for the </v>

714
00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 1>operation to keep them dumb.</v>

715
00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.890
<v Speaker 2>The criminals bought the watchdog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

716
00:29:55.891 --> 00:29:56.724
<v Speaker 2>The watch dog used to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Walter cronkite and 60 minutes and </v>

717
00:30:00.481 --> 00:30:01.500
<v Speaker 2>then they got smart and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

718
00:30:01.501 --> 00:30:04.680
<v Speaker 2>let's just buy them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they bought them and so now the guys</v>

719
00:30:04.681 --> 00:30:07.650
<v Speaker 2>who are working for the people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be exposing,</v>

720
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.360
<v Speaker 2>so that's why they are literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

721
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.171
<v Speaker 2>So that's how you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

722
00:30:10.171 --> 00:30:11.004
<v Speaker 2>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we get it into a rack war that </v>

723
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.400
<v Speaker 2>lasted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get it because the people</v>

724
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:15.323
<v Speaker 2>are working for the defense contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to be exposing defense </v>

725
00:30:17.491 --> 00:30:19.110
<v Speaker 2>contractors and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

726
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.433
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reality where it will ever </v>

727
00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:22.324
<v Speaker 3>turn around.</v>

728
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

729
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I think if we get money out of politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

730
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.970
<v Speaker 2>So it happened before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

731
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:31.390
<v Speaker 2>So Teddy Roosevelt came along and he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antitrust legislation,</v>

732
00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:32.224
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to call them trust back then </v>

733
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 2>because they would take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

734
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.580
<v Speaker 2>that was the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now that's what we need.</v>

735
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:40.180
<v Speaker 2>We need him and then we need FDR.</v>
<v Speaker 2>FDR stood up and said,</v>

736
00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:42.590
<v Speaker 2>never before in the history of America </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the money.</v>

737
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 2>People have been more organized in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred for one candidate,</v>

738
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.400
<v Speaker 2>and I welcome their hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine,</v>

739
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.430
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone saying that today?</v>

740
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Besides Bernie Sanders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

741
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.463
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a little inspiration from you </v>

742
00:30:52.941 --> 00:30:54.440
<v Speaker 1>first because it sounded like it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

743
00:30:54.441 --> 00:30:55.580
<v Speaker 1>but then I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

744
00:30:55.581 --> 00:30:58.700
<v Speaker 1>if we get hillary is president or let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>say we get Jeb Bush.</v>

745
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure they're not making that </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

746
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

747
00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.740
<v Speaker 1>If that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may.</v>

748
00:31:03.741 --> 00:31:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Well never have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy a gun.</v>

749
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:05.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

750
00:31:05.751 --> 00:31:06.584
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

751
00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.260
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about religion and politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then,</v>

752
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.340
<v Speaker 1>because that's the other big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look a Guy Mike Huckabee's up there.</v>

753
00:31:13.341 --> 00:31:14.174
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy that the week before was </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending Kim Davis and everyone knows </v>

754
00:31:17.781 --> 00:31:22.310
<v Speaker 1>about Kim Davis and not giving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage licenses to gay people.</v>

755
00:31:22.311 --> 00:31:25.820
<v Speaker 1>And Mike Huckabee actually defended her </v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying you shouldn't,</v>

756
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

757
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.840
<v Speaker 1>partake in the law that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe is moral.</v>

758
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.310
<v Speaker 1>That is the most ridiculous anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>American thing you could possibly do.</v>

759
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.100
<v Speaker 1>It shows that profound lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of how government works.</v>

760
00:31:37.101 --> 00:31:38.810
<v Speaker 1>At our constitution and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

761
00:31:38.811 --> 00:31:39.890
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's him,</v>

762
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 1>there's crews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Santorum and these guys.</v>

763
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:48.310
<v Speaker 1>And even now a Ben Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do about this conversation?</v>

764
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Religion should have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have separation of church and state.</v>

765
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

766
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.810
<v Speaker 1>what do we do about it?</v>

767
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was googling this topic matter earlier</v>

768
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:02.610
<v Speaker 3>and I saw that the boy scouts don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow atheists in the boy scouts.</v>

769
00:32:02.611 --> 00:32:03.444
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking it's people don't </v>

770
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.223
<v Speaker 3>want to trust other people who aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious or can pretend to be </v>

771
00:32:11.641 --> 00:32:13.170
<v Speaker 3>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

772
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.960
<v Speaker 3>with decisions that are going to impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

773
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I kind of get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand,</v>

774
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.790
<v Speaker 3>have you ever been around?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have aunts that are so religious,</v>

775
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 3>they are evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

776
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Has there ever been around people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

777
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.310
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

778
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.980
<v Speaker 3>I went to Catholic school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

779
00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.140
<v Speaker 3>That's what you and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I look at the Republican,</v>

780
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.180
<v Speaker 3>a spectrum out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the candidates,</v>

781
00:32:36.181 --> 00:32:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

782
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.580
<v Speaker 3>these people evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

783
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.593
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have blinders like this about </v>

784
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 3>religious and how everyone has to follow</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same religion or the same thing that</v>

785
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:50.534
<v Speaker 3>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is just as bad as someone </v>

786
00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:56.270
<v Speaker 3>who has a void of it and I know that</v>

787
00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.320
<v Speaker 1>just as bad as those horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a secular values.</v>

788
00:33:01.921 --> 00:33:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as equally horrible.</v>

789
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.261
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

790
00:33:04.261 --> 00:33:05.094
<v Speaker 1>Is this the irony of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the irony of Republicans that </v>

791
00:33:08.671 --> 00:33:10.770
<v Speaker 1>they say they want small government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

792
00:33:10.771 --> 00:33:11.604
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say they want some other way and </v>

793
00:33:12.211 --> 00:33:14.960
<v Speaker 1>then at the same time they keep jamming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] everyone.</v>

794
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't live those notes.</v>

795
00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you said your question is how do</v>

796
00:33:18.401 --> 00:33:21.340
<v Speaker 2>we get religion out of government in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing is they should be made to go</v>

797
00:33:21.341 --> 00:33:22.174
<v Speaker 2>to an religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People should have to take an irony </v>

798
00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:24.730
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

799
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

800
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Kim Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's thrice divorced,</v>

801
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.610
<v Speaker 2>making a religious stand for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctity of marriage,</v>

802
00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:31.930
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

803
00:33:31.931 --> 00:33:32.764
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now the oath keepers have promised </v>

804
00:33:35.021 --> 00:33:37.840
<v Speaker 2>to defend her and they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lock her up again.</v>

805
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.953
<v Speaker 2>She's so grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She promised to marry three or four of </v>

806
00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:41.740
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

807
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:42.783
<v Speaker 2>And then they played that song right </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it with a tiger and so when she </v>

808
00:33:45.881 --> 00:33:46.714
<v Speaker 2>came out and she and she got in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that because they didn't want her </v>

809
00:33:48.821 --> 00:33:50.320
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Survivor doesn't want to use that song.</v>

810
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.450
<v Speaker 2>But she said she liked that song so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

811
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.070
<v Speaker 2>She's going to play it at our next three</v>
<v Speaker 2>weddings.</v>

812
00:33:54.071 --> 00:33:54.904
<v Speaker 2>The point is day.</v>

813
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of these jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ruined rocky for me.</v>

814
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about Huckabee?</v>

815
00:34:01.861 --> 00:34:04.100
<v Speaker 1>So someone like Huckabee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's supposedly like,</v>

816
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.023
<v Speaker 1>to me this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is proof that he's not running for </v>

817
00:34:06.391 --> 00:34:09.510
<v Speaker 1>president and he's running to run the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>

818
00:34:09.511 --> 00:34:10.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

819
00:34:10.321 --> 00:34:12.310
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wish people would just say that as</v>

820
00:34:12.311 --> 00:34:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I wish almost he could say that and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>

821
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:14.933
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm up on this stage because I do </v>

822
00:34:16.801 --> 00:34:17.634
<v Speaker 1>control or at least want to control a </v>
<v Speaker 1>portion of this country and I want to </v>

823
00:34:21.331 --> 00:34:23.940
<v Speaker 1>keep controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we can be honest about it.</v>

824
00:34:23.941 --> 00:34:25.350
<v Speaker 1>And then he would disappear when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets,</v>

825
00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:26.843
<v Speaker 1>when the is go further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's not really running for </v>

826
00:34:28.951 --> 00:34:29.611
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

827
00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he running his own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That degree of power?</v>

828
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I think you're very perceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave Bliss is.</v>

829
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I think why you have your own show once </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a while and yes,</v>

830
00:34:38.031 --> 00:34:41.030
<v Speaker 2>that is exactly what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's running to get speaking fees.</v>

831
00:34:41.031 --> 00:34:43.470
<v Speaker 2>He's running to be the biggest Christian</v>
<v Speaker 2>onstage.</v>

832
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.700
<v Speaker 2>So non whoever does become president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the Billy Graham.</v>

833
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:47.534
<v Speaker 2>They have to come through him to get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the religious right that they're going </v>

834
00:34:49.111 --> 00:34:50.570
<v Speaker 2>to need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all that.</v>

835
00:34:50.571 --> 00:34:51.404
<v Speaker 2>He's the biggest charlatan of all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because at least Donald Trump who </v>

836
00:34:54.531 --> 00:34:55.364
<v Speaker 2>is a big asshole won't take that extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>step of putting the cross on his sleeve </v>

837
00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:01.544
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a pocket he was and how it can be </v>

838
00:35:02.631 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 2>as complete phony.</v>

839
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And trump.</v>

840
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Not that I ever wanted to defend trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

841
00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:08.240
<v Speaker 1>they asked trump about the gay marriage </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and he said,</v>

842
00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:09.650
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Supreme Court made a decision.</v>

843
00:35:09.651 --> 00:35:10.484
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to abide by the Supreme </v>

844
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shows a better understanding of how</v>

845
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:17.110
<v Speaker 1>government works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Santorum or Huckabee,</v>

846
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.210
<v Speaker 1>who want you to just pick which laws can</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine if we could all just pick.</v>

847
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pay taxes morally.</v>

848
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

849
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Separate but equal.</v>

850
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 2>So that means we can just ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

851
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.530
<v Speaker 2>that's not that sounds right.</v>

852
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.493
<v Speaker 3>But I do like what you're saying about </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's running to get a speaking </v>

853
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:30.944
<v Speaker 3>engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the reality is how much money </v>

854
00:35:33.801 --> 00:35:34.634
<v Speaker 3>is he spending to try to run for </v>
<v Speaker 3>president versus how much you would </v>

855
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.350
<v Speaker 3>actually ever make</v>

856
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 1>as a space spending his own money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

857
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:41.730
<v Speaker 1>So he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

858
00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.593
<v Speaker 1>it's not his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately it's not about the </v>

859
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:45.684
<v Speaker 1>speaking money per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as just the influence that he </v>

860
00:35:47.611 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 1>will just run the Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

861
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Like be the next billy Graham or </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

862
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.140
<v Speaker 1>But I want to backup the saying that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said early about this,</v>

863
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.023
<v Speaker 1>this atheist thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the first two episodes of the </v>

864
00:35:55.681 --> 00:35:56.514
<v Speaker 1>show we had Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's probably the most outspoken </v>

865
00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.900
<v Speaker 1>atheist and Carrie Santa Maria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

866
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:05.400
<v Speaker 1>also an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked a little bit about,</v>

867
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.413
<v Speaker 1>I'm atheist and politics and every poll </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that people would never vote for </v>

868
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:11.250
<v Speaker 1>an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People hate atheist.</v>

869
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.353
<v Speaker 1>Why are we so afraid of secularism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is sort of what you were </v>

870
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 1>saying before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we afraid of people that would,</v>

871
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.310
<v Speaker 1>that would base their decisions on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law of the land and not the imaginary.</v>

872
00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because everyone has this </v>
<v Speaker 3>like ultimate fantasy of the.</v>

873
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.460
<v Speaker 3>You get to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something terrible goes down somewhere.</v>

874
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 3>He has his finger on the button,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

875
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going to happen?</v>

876
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:34.374
<v Speaker 3>You want to know that your president is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be in that dark space in his </v>

877
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:39.090
<v Speaker 3>room before he asked to make some </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible decision like,</v>

878
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:39.924
<v Speaker 3>dear God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want the comfort of knowing it's a </v>

879
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.860
<v Speaker 3>whole facade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fake,</v>

880
00:36:43.861 --> 00:36:45.810
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

881
00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 3>You don't want someone that's just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the line,</v>

882
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 3>the column of good things that'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

883
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 3>This is the column of bad things I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

884
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 3>because people want to be able to hang </v>
<v Speaker 3>hope on a president and,</v>

885
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.420
<v Speaker 3>and as weird as it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what he is,</v>

886
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.410
<v Speaker 3>you don't hang on.</v>

887
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for the fact that I think it's</v>

888
00:37:04.001 --> 00:37:06.260
<v Speaker 1>the same thing with gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

889
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:07.143
<v Speaker 1>people were against gay marriage until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew a gay person and I think </v>

890
00:37:11.621 --> 00:37:13.990
<v Speaker 1>people are afraid of atheists until they</v>
<v Speaker 1>known atheist.</v>

891
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I was against gay marriage to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey married.</v>

892
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay there.</v>

893
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.740
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about it?</v>

894
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:21.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what I really think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

895
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.890
<v Speaker 1>People just don't know atheists and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

896
00:37:23.891 --> 00:37:24.724
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dying.</v>

897
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.173
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of be quitting with devil </v>

898
00:37:26.801 --> 00:37:28.190
<v Speaker 1>worshipers know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

899
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no worshiping nothing,</v>

900
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.330
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly why I've been saying on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show repeatedly.</v>

901
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atheist have to come out.</v>

902
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I think the atheist movement should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

903
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.890
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing that gay people</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did was come out.</v>

904
00:37:38.891 --> 00:37:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's what's next for </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheism.</v>

905
00:37:40.511 --> 00:37:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should start calling ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

906
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the term non theist.</v>

907
00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

908
00:37:45.431 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It sounds better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

909
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:48.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not into the shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

910
00:37:48.281 --> 00:37:49.114
<v Speaker 1>but don't you hate that you even have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>associate with the term doesn't that in </v>

911
00:37:51.311 --> 00:37:52.810
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like then you're in the club,</v>

912
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:54.760
<v Speaker 1>what club would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why me kind of thing.</v>

913
00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

914
00:37:55.841 --> 00:38:00.010
<v Speaker 1>and I don't agree that there is such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as militant atheism.</v>

915
00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree.</v>

916
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.090
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying you're a militant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical person.</v>

917
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I will apply logic to every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

918
00:38:08.381 --> 00:38:12.160
<v Speaker 1>all these atheists that are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>rallies together to hurt people.</v>

919
00:38:12.161 --> 00:38:13.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

920
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.393
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a perfect segue to the next </v>

921
00:38:15.341 --> 00:38:16.174
<v Speaker 1>thing I want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the PC culture that we seem to </v>

922
00:38:17.411 --> 00:38:18.880
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have two comedians.</v>

923
00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.790
<v Speaker 1>This is our job more than anything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to,</v>

924
00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.910
<v Speaker 1>is to get to that line and figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it is and push it.</v>

925
00:38:24.911 --> 00:38:25.744
<v Speaker 1>Maybe cross it every now and again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we live in a very bizarre time </v>

926
00:38:28.511 --> 00:38:29.344
<v Speaker 1>where we have trigger warnings now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these social justice warriors and every </v>

927
00:38:33.491 --> 00:38:37.300
<v Speaker 1>time anyone says anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say something about women they don't</v>

928
00:38:37.301 --> 00:38:38.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they they.</v>

929
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.220
<v Speaker 1>You're now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hate women.</v>

930
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:43.210
<v Speaker 1>You say something about any minority you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like or you say anything about gay</v>

931
00:38:43.211 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You automatically hate all of them.</v>

932
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.083
<v Speaker 1>That we automatically jumped to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that it's based in racism or </v>

933
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:52.570
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially for Comedians.</v>

934
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 1>This is a seriously dangerous slope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

935
00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.440
<v Speaker 2>He knows the worst with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Puerto Ricans.</v>

936
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

938
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's so much about pc </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

939
00:39:05.721 --> 00:39:08.180
<v Speaker 3>I just think everyone has a knee jerk </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction.</v>

940
00:39:08.181 --> 00:39:10.610
<v Speaker 3>People are like this now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are people like this now?</v>

941
00:39:10.611 --> 00:39:11.444
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is so angry and no one just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to enjoy jokes or have fun </v>

942
00:39:15.381 --> 00:39:16.011
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every.</v>

943
00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:16.844
<v Speaker 3>Everything has to be a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now they have the new normal </v>

944
00:39:18.801 --> 00:39:19.634
<v Speaker 3>Barbie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a Barbie doll that has stretch </v>

945
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:25.290
<v Speaker 3>marks and pimples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unnormal Barbie and I just,</v>

946
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:26.703
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't people just have toys and not </v>

947
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:28.923
<v Speaker 3>reading a million things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does everything have to have a 100 </v>

948
00:39:31.821 --> 00:39:36.150
<v Speaker 3>percent purpose or you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be without any humor or anything.</v>

949
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:37.243
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that actually takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>something very special away from </v>

950
00:39:40.401 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 1>childhood that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

951
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.500
<v Speaker 1>I played with Gi Joe or human or </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformers and the imagination,</v>

952
00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I've got to use my imagination to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>up this world and you know,</v>

953
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.770
<v Speaker 1>figure out things that I thought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

954
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:52.783
<v Speaker 1>where now you're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything so realistic for these kids </v>

955
00:39:54.621 --> 00:39:58.910
<v Speaker 1>and have them have every fear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that might upset them,</v>

956
00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.650
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to send a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>robots and by the way,</v>

957
00:40:00.651 --> 00:40:01.401
<v Speaker 1>they're drugged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

958
00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:03.380
<v Speaker 1>They're all on every drug known to man </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>

959
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

960
00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.820
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to send them out into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>world drugged and afraid of everything.</v>

961
00:40:07.821 --> 00:40:09.260
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty dangerous combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

962
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving back to the PC thing,</v>

963
00:40:11.841 --> 00:40:12.674
<v Speaker 2>you are correct that some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are to knee jerk and cry a </v>

964
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.510
<v Speaker 2>racism or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism.</v>

965
00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.420
<v Speaker 2>But there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is racism and there is.</v>

966
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:25.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's like murky right here,</v>

967
00:40:25.971 --> 00:40:26.804
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't want to get into a point </v>

968
00:40:28.191 --> 00:40:29.024
<v Speaker 2>where we just shout so now because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing does a thing where they shop </v>

969
00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.320
<v Speaker 2>every time there actually is racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

970
00:40:33.321 --> 00:40:34.790
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just too PC.</v>

971
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:36.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not being too pc.</v>

972
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:37.483
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

973
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:38.323
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be when the right will say </v>

974
00:40:39.381 --> 00:40:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that Christians are actually the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>under attack in America,</v>

975
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:43.403
<v Speaker 2>which is of course completely or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian is going to have their day in </v>

976
00:40:46.851 --> 00:40:47.720
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

977
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.560
<v Speaker 2>someday they're going to have a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the White House to run things.</v>

978
00:40:51.561 --> 00:40:53.040
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

979
00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:55.370
<v Speaker 2>the thing that Jerry Seinfeld rights for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came up with,</v>

980
00:40:55.371 --> 00:40:57.980
<v Speaker 2>he was complaining about pc culture on </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus.</v>

981
00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I haven't in colleges in a year but I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean in a couple of years,</v>

982
00:41:01.581 --> 00:41:04.970
<v Speaker 2>but I noticed when I used to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges that the higher their tuition,</v>

983
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:06.920
<v Speaker 2>the more freedom I got to say whatever I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>

984
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.660
<v Speaker 2>And it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

985
00:41:08.661 --> 00:41:10.070
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the lower the tuition,</v>

986
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:10.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the DM or the kids or </v>

987
00:41:11.661 --> 00:41:12.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

988
00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I went to a shoe that's very politically</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>

989
00:41:14.691 --> 00:41:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's politically incorrect.</v>

990
00:41:16.011 --> 00:41:19.660
<v Speaker 2>So I went to a suny school and I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb guy so I can say that and uh,</v>

991
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't look up where I went.</v>

992
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Went to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is it sucked.</v>

993
00:41:25.431 --> 00:41:26.680
<v Speaker 2>George Bush went there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

994
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trigger war.</v>

995
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:28.683
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

996
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first for,</v>

997
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.113
<v Speaker 2>of course dancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be someone who reads </v>

998
00:41:32.511 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 2>something and it's going to fuck them </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

999
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Will you can't pass a law about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1000
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 2>that's their own problem they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with.</v>

1001
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you know when I hear what I hear a </v>
<v Speaker 2>car horns,</v>

1002
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:41.234
<v Speaker 2>I freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't pass a law that says nobody can </v>

1003
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:43.940
<v Speaker 2>beat their horn anymore.</v>

1004
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the bigger fear.</v>

1005
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I used to fear that the first amendment </v>
<v Speaker 1>would disappear,</v>

1006
00:41:48.931 --> 00:41:50.760
<v Speaker 1>that the government would take our free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

1007
00:41:50.761 --> 00:41:51.594
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm starting to fear now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I am no big fan of the </v>

1008
00:41:53.701 --> 00:41:54.534
<v Speaker 1>government in any capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm starting to fear now is that </v>

1009
00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.190
<v Speaker 1>ultimately we're just going to take our </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms away.</v>

1010
00:41:59.191 --> 00:42:00.024
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get so afraid of saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and I see this happen all the </v>

1011
00:42:02.401 --> 00:42:03.930
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I get emails,</v>

1012
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.360
<v Speaker 1>not that I'm the most politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect person there is,</v>

1013
00:42:06.361 --> 00:42:07.194
<v Speaker 1>but I get emails now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People saying that I'm saying things </v>

1014
00:42:08.731 --> 00:42:09.564
<v Speaker 1>that they wish they could say and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that people are censoring </v>

1015
00:42:12.721 --> 00:42:13.554
<v Speaker 1>themselves already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I fear that I fear the self </v>

1016
00:42:15.721 --> 00:42:16.554
<v Speaker 1>censorship because of all this more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fear that the government's going to </v>

1017
00:42:20.641 --> 00:42:22.470
<v Speaker 1>come in and take away our right to free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

1018
00:42:22.471 --> 00:42:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you.</v>

1019
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:23.873
<v Speaker 1>Where do you fall on that?</v>

1020
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 3>All?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say this.</v>

1021
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:30.440
<v Speaker 3>I was just working vegas last weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one set where I was having.</v>

1022
00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.293
<v Speaker 3>It was a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crowd was tight and a guy was </v>

1023
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:36.800
<v Speaker 3>sitting with his arms crossed and I for </v>
<v Speaker 3>15 years I've always said,</v>

1024
00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:38.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know our endoscopes.</v>

1025
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to let them go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>

1026
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.233
<v Speaker 3>three guys sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys where's the girls and all that </v>

1027
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:44.001
<v Speaker 3>were that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1028
00:42:44.001 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 3>that is totally hacky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it Kinda gets the crowd,</v>

1029
00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:47.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going when you're in the mood.</v>

1030
00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.920
<v Speaker 3>But now people aren't buying into those </v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes and it was a realization of wow,</v>

1031
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.210
<v Speaker 3>people really rpc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good thing.</v>

1032
00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:00.780
<v Speaker 3>So I think there is a legitimate reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be pc.</v>

1033
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:05.460
<v Speaker 3>We're growing as people and and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are things we don't accept anymore.</v>

1034
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.313
<v Speaker 3>We don't accept racism anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't accept making jokes about gays </v>

1035
00:43:08.571 --> 00:43:10.160
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a good thing.</v>

1036
00:43:10.161 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 3>I think the comedians that say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1037
00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:15.170
<v Speaker 3>it's too pc to pc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might be correct,</v>

1038
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:20.171
<v Speaker 3>but in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you need to change to the idea.</v>

1039
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.553
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 1>Silverman said something to that effect </v>

1040
00:43:24.451 --> 00:43:25.284
<v Speaker 1>this week and in an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think she was directing it at </v>

1041
00:43:27.481 --> 00:43:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld because Seinfeld basically was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1042
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to make this gay joke about a </v>

1043
00:43:32.101 --> 00:43:33.540
<v Speaker 1>French king and his loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:43:33.541 --> 00:43:36.000
<v Speaker 1>his hand like this and now they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too offensive.</v>

1045
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.210
<v Speaker 1>But I would always be on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you to call Seinfeld.</v>

1046
00:43:39.211 --> 00:43:40.044
<v Speaker 1>Politically incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he thinks about </v>

1047
00:43:41.131 --> 00:43:43.650
<v Speaker 1>anything either thinks about anything.</v>

1048
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear what he said about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cotton ball?</v>

1049
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1050
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my,</v>

1051
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:48.500
<v Speaker 2>my weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my final,</v>

1052
00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:49.334
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful final thought about this </v>

1053
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>because there's comes a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1054
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:52.904
<v Speaker 2>Like so now we've come a long way with </v>
<v Speaker 2>how gay people are treated in our </v>

1055
00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:55.874
<v Speaker 2>society in a positive way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's guys who were born at a </v>

1056
00:43:58.551 --> 00:44:00.860
<v Speaker 2>certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Alec Baldwin,</v>

1057
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.723
<v Speaker 2>they grew up using gay terms as slurs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and insults and then when that lizard </v>

1058
00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:07.880
<v Speaker 2>brain gets activated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're angry at someone,</v>

1059
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:09.170
<v Speaker 2>those things come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1060
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.710
<v Speaker 2>And so Alec Baldwin got in trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling a guy a cock sucking faggot.</v>

1061
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he said he called him a cock sucking</v>

1062
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.090
<v Speaker 2>bedhead because apparently cocksuckers </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender neutral,</v>

1063
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 2>but no one swears like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>

1064
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:21.554
<v Speaker 2>Nobody says a $4,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swear word and then follows it up with </v>

1065
00:44:23.011 --> 00:44:24.770
<v Speaker 2>the cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody goes,</v>

1066
00:44:24.771 --> 00:44:26.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mother fucking farks narco.</v>

1067
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1068
00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:29.930
<v Speaker 2>So that's good people.</v>

1069
00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of a leash if you grew up.</v>

1070
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:33.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if he apologizes or our lies </v>

1071
00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.540
<v Speaker 2>are lies about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I haven't.</v>

1072
00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Baldwin did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1073
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.160
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he apologizes.</v>

1074
00:44:40.161 --> 00:44:40.994
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad said racist things when I was </v>

1075
00:44:42.681 --> 00:44:45.500
<v Speaker 3>growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad would never do it now,</v>

1076
00:44:45.501 --> 00:44:46.334
<v Speaker 3>but he should get bull connor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I was growing up as a 27 year </v>

1077
00:44:50.451 --> 00:44:51.284
<v Speaker 3>old man or a 30 year old man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said stuff and my brother made would </v>

1078
00:44:53.631 --> 00:44:54.464
<v Speaker 3>be like director and now he would never </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that because everyone grows at a </v>

1079
00:44:57.501 --> 00:44:58.760
<v Speaker 3>different rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1080
00:44:58.761 --> 00:45:01.880
<v Speaker 3>people are learning at different ages </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know.</v>

1081
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1082
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:05.840
<v Speaker 3>So I apologize at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1083
00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that the,</v>

1084
00:45:07.641 --> 00:45:11.480
<v Speaker 1>the right way to end something with </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians would be to talk about counter</v>

1085
00:45:11.481 --> 00:45:12.314
<v Speaker 1>culture a little bit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterculture is what standup grew out </v>

1086
00:45:15.161 --> 00:45:15.790
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1087
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:18.400
<v Speaker 1>It used to be cool to fight the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1088
00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:21.460
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like it's not cool to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system anymore.</v>

1089
00:45:21.461 --> 00:45:24.640
<v Speaker 1>You're thought of as crazy or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

1090
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it has a lot to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most comics are liberal.</v>

1091
00:45:28.511 --> 00:45:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Most comics really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at the beginning,</v>

1092
00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.620
<v Speaker 1>really liked Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody would say,</v>

1093
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:33.463
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to make jokes about this guy </v>

1094
00:45:34.811 --> 00:45:38.710
<v Speaker 1>because he's rational and speaks clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he is not making all the grammatical</v>

1095
00:45:38.711 --> 00:45:40.570
<v Speaker 1>errors that Bush was making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1096
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.673
<v Speaker 1>now it's changed and I think people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily like Obama as much or </v>

1097
00:45:44.771 --> 00:45:46.750
<v Speaker 1>at least people on the left that field </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's,</v>

1098
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been more right wing.</v>

1099
00:45:48.131 --> 00:45:48.964
<v Speaker 1>I think certainly that's what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't have a real counterculture </v>

1100
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.750
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we need a Republican in office to</v>

1101
00:45:55.751 --> 00:46:00.751
<v Speaker 1>have a true counterculture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that actually help the country?</v>

1102
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:05.890
<v Speaker 1>People have someone that I believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that they actually stand for</v>

1103
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 2>the argument that would strengthen the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument has been made that Barack Obama</v>

1104
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:10.883
<v Speaker 2>being the head of the government right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now splits the opposition because </v>

1105
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:14.634
<v Speaker 2>they're the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should be opposing him about the </v>

1106
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:18.660
<v Speaker 2>indefinite detention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>TPP,</v>

1107
00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff that Syria war with.</v>

1108
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 2>You and I are on the same page on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should.</v>

1109
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:27.743
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By Barack Obama being the head of the </v>

1110
00:46:29.251 --> 00:46:30.084
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he splits the opposition because half </v>

1111
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:32.094
<v Speaker 2>the people are loyalty and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other half the people are telling the </v>

1112
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:35.394
<v Speaker 2>truth or wanting to push back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest against a terror radical </v>

1113
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:40.050
<v Speaker 2>government are bullshit that they see in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>

1114
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.080
<v Speaker 2>And so it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what's happening and that</v>

1115
00:46:43.081 --> 00:46:45.140
<v Speaker 2>is what happened and that's why there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>no counterculture.</v>

1116
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Good enough for you to pick up on it.</v>

1117
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I get a couple every episode I get one </v>
<v Speaker 1>or two bring,</v>

1118
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.670
<v Speaker 1>bring us home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it up.</v>

1119
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:51.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1120
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I was watching Bill Maher the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>night and he was of course making fun of</v>

1121
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:55.434
<v Speaker 3>Republicans and George Pataki was on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and it's gotten to the point </v>

1122
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:59.790
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1123
00:46:59.791 --> 00:47:00.624
<v Speaker 3>you want to have one Republican in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mix when you're talking politics and </v>

1124
00:47:04.171 --> 00:47:05.760
<v Speaker 3>doing the counterculture thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

1125
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:06.893
<v Speaker 3>But even George Pataki's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well my poverty and it's just an </v>

1126
00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:16.650
<v Speaker 3>indication of we've just all moved to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right,</v>

1127
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:17.793
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we do need a Republican in </v>

1128
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:22.540
<v Speaker 1>office to wake up the people to actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize what's important.</v>

1129
00:47:22.541 --> 00:47:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1130
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.640
<v Speaker 1>and it would at least be good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>

1131
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.151
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1132
00:47:25.151 --> 00:47:27.250
<v Speaker 1>On that note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank Felicia Michael's,</v>
