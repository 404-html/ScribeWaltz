1
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's official.</v>

2
00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>We are entering the age of unenlightened</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant my friend,</v>

3
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>a true feminist in the best sense of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

4
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:13.024
<v Speaker 1>and a fearless defender of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina Hoff sommers was invited to </v>

5
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 1>speak at Lewis and Clark law school this</v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's what happened when she began her </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Christina Christina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>victim mentality.</v>

8
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Microaggressions are real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

9
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

10
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.973
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

11
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Putting aside the creepiness of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comb,</v>

12
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 1>like repetitive chanting from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protesters.</v>

13
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Their use of free speech actually isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>a use of free speech at all.</v>

14
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>While of course they have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protest your right to exercise.</v>

15
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:40.814
<v Speaker 1>Your free speech doesn't come at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expense of someone else's right to </v>

16
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so.</v>

17
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>What this means is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can peacefully protest outside of an</v>

18
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:50.784
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can silently protest inside of an </v>

19
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:54.074
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hold all the signs you want and </v>

20
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>you can encourage others to join your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>

21
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>You cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

22
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>use your freedoms to trample on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedoms of others.</v>

23
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.963
<v Speaker 1>This chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again took place before Christina </v>

24
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:07.904
<v Speaker 1>had even begun to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reminded me of when I was at Ucla with </v>

25
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:11.744
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos about two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protesters screen spit through garbage </v>

26
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>cans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled fire alarms,</v>

27
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>and even called him bomb threats before </v>
<v Speaker 1>we even took the stage.</v>

28
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.543
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps most egregiously though was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of students who linked arms to </v>

29
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>create a human wall to stop us and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers from even going inside the venue</v>

30
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they aren't against walls,</v>

31
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:34.664
<v Speaker 1>they just don't like trump's wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina has continued through the </v>

32
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 1>chanting and the protestors then broke </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in song.</v>

33
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 2>We've gone side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which side are you on?</v>

34
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Fred's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which side are you on?</v>

35
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Quite a catchy tune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you say?</v>

36
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina Hoff.</v>

37
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:10.404
<v Speaker 1>Sommers is in a fascist at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just an old school liberal who </v>

38
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:16.950
<v Speaker 1>dare challenge Modern Day leftism </v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically,</v>

39
00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:21.030
<v Speaker 1>bs people so keen on fighting the fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism in their minds,</v>

40
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:21.864
<v Speaker 1>don't understand that they themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the ones who are actually using </v>

41
00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 1>fascist tactics of silencing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drowning out their opponents until there</v>

42
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:33.480
<v Speaker 1>is no opposition remaining at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're still confused,</v>

43
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:34.314
<v Speaker 1>here's a simple definition of fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascism is a form of radical </v>

44
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.510
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian nationalism characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by dictatorial power,</v>

45
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 1>forcible suppression of opposition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Control of industry and commerce,</v>

46
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:50.820
<v Speaker 1>which came to prominence in early 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century Europe.</v>

47
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Christina Hoff sommers</v>
<v Speaker 1>is for dictatorial power?</v>

48
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Is she for forcible suppression of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition?</v>

49
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.733
<v Speaker 1>To top it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she even works at the American </v>

50
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Enterprise Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is against control of industry and</v>

51
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 1>commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

52
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:05.454
<v Speaker 1>just think for a moment if the idea is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these students were espousing were </v>

53
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:09.294
<v Speaker 1>the set of ideas and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually would be for dictatorial </v>

54
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:13.494
<v Speaker 1>control as they believed their cause is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most just and their opponents are </v>

55
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:18.090
<v Speaker 1>simply evil.</v>

56
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.990
<v Speaker 1>How do you think it would be going for </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissent and opposition in their system?</v>

57
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.123
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most insidious piece of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cultural Marxism that we see spreading </v>

58
00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:27.204
<v Speaker 1>on college campuses these days is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is using the freedoms that are </v>

59
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:34.800
<v Speaker 1>democratic capitalist society has </v>
<v Speaker 1>against itself.</v>

60
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.963
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would never offer these same </v>

61
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>protections to minority voices in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dystopian future that it would bring.</v>

62
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.893
<v Speaker 1>While this event thankfully wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly as violent as when Milo went to </v>

63
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.280
<v Speaker 1>uc Berkeley and the school burned down </v>
<v Speaker 1>or when it took $600,000</v>

64
00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:54.180
<v Speaker 1>of security to ensure that Ben Shapiro </v>
<v Speaker 1>could speak there without threat.</v>

65
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.313
<v Speaker 1>This display at Lewis and Clark is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>another reminder of how the backwards </v>

66
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:00.264
<v Speaker 1>thinking of Cultural Marxism is coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all dissenters cloaked in the mask </v>

67
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:05.634
<v Speaker 1>of tolerance and diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These incidences are happening all over </v>

68
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.313
<v Speaker 1>colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the country and turning places </v>

69
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:12.774
<v Speaker 1>of higher learning into places where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just getting high on </v>

70
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:17.280
<v Speaker 1>intersectionality.</v>

71
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.683
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this story really only broke on right </v>

72
00:05:20.301 --> 00:05:21.134
<v Speaker 1>leaning blogs and was only shared by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>usual suspects who continually defend </v>

73
00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As of recording this,</v>

74
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen any left leaning websites</v>
<v Speaker 1>that covered it.</v>

75
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.770
<v Speaker 1>The reason for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

76
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:33.540
<v Speaker 1>is twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one hand,</v>

77
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>when you can win arguments by silencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your opponents,</v>

78
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:38.820
<v Speaker 1>your job is pretty easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also,</v>

79
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good actors on the left,</v>

80
00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:46.410
<v Speaker 1>which I still believe there are some who</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to call out events like this.</v>

81
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:47.244
<v Speaker 1>Rarely do because they know that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same tactics of smearing and silencing </v>

82
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:52.224
<v Speaker 1>will eventually be used against them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there'll be purged from their </v>

83
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>former home just as former guests of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine like Bret Weinstein,</v>

84
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Laura Kipnis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Shepherd,</v>

85
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:05.801
<v Speaker 1>and others who dare speak out against </v>
<v Speaker 1>this tyrannical fo diversity movement.</v>

86
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>The silver lining though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

87
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>is that the more that people like Brett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura,</v>

88
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.873
<v Speaker 1>and others speak out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more room may give for people like </v>

89
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 1>you to do the exact same in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Berkeley,</v>

90
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:17.294
<v Speaker 1>I spoke there yesterday with Heather </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald and Steve Simpson and I'll be </v>

91
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>speaking at many other colleges in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming months.</v>

92
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Come join me wherever I may be an asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>me as many hard questions in the q and a</v>

93
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:27.434
<v Speaker 1>as you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ask only one thing which is that if </v>

94
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:29.984
<v Speaker 1>you sing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please make it a little snappier than </v>

95
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>what we just heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cover of journey,</v>

96
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.304
<v Speaker 1>fleetwood Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even Frank Sinatra would be </v>

97
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:36.644
<v Speaker 1>preferable.</v>

98
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Joining me today is the senior editor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Atlantic or contributor on MSNBC and</v>

99
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>the author of the new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump ocracy,</v>

100
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.190
<v Speaker 1>the corruption of the American republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

101
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>and welcome to the Rubin report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for having me.</v>

102
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to have you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted you on for a couple of years.</v>

103
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I think at this point you were a tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy to track down,</v>

104
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 1>but we made it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm find-able hiding yet.</v>

105
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>You're not in hiding yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't be maybe by the end of this</v>

106
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>interview because I let my guests talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd never know.</v>

107
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the twitter formula.</v>

108
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.314
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like 140 characters away from </v>

109
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 1>career self-immolation yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:19.630
<v Speaker 1>we've got about 60 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see about emulation immediately.</v>

111
00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of the things I want to talk to</v>

112
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:21.881
<v Speaker 1>you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought your,</v>

113
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>your personal history is interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually when I see you on television,</v>

114
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the day to day </v>
<v Speaker 1>machinations of politics.</v>

115
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>You are Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

116
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>I find that I like Canadians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just everyone does.</v>

117
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Why are you people so agreeable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're so passive aggressive,</v>

118
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up,</v>

119
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

120
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.383
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

121
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.823
<v Speaker 3>we have a place in Prince Edward County,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about two and a half east of </v>

122
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two and half hours east of Toronto where</v>

123
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.830
<v Speaker 3>my wife and I and our children are spent</v>
<v Speaker 3>summers now for almost three decades.</v>

124
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

125
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Canada's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

126
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

127
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.870
<v Speaker 3>is a kind of mirror image of the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States with some things,</v>

128
00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:03.360
<v Speaker 3>omitted things intensified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

129
00:08:03.361 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Speaker 3>and I think it offers Americans often a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>

130
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wha what if a examination of the,</v>

131
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 3>of what the United States might have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been under different circumstances.</v>

132
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.763
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think's omitted and what do </v>

133
00:08:14.341 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you think is intensified?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

134
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 3>so a candidate didn't have the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>south.</v>

135
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.890
<v Speaker 3>It didn't have slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have a civil war.</v>

136
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.933
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada had a peaceful separation from </v>

137
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't have the,</v>

138
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.810
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have the kind of citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>military traditions.</v>

139
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.970
<v Speaker 3>Canadians have a very different attitude</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards guns.</v>

140
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

141
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.160
<v Speaker 3>my neighbors in Prince Edward County,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

142
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.610
<v Speaker 3>all have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not all but many have long guns,</v>

143
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.260
<v Speaker 3>hunting pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shotguns,</v>

144
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.333
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of having a handgun or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>military style weapon is a very alien </v>

145
00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:46.630
<v Speaker 3>idea for Canadians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

146
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.660
<v Speaker 1>You think some of the Canadian attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also that there's a lot of geographic</v>

147
00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:54.660
<v Speaker 1>space and not that many people actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

148
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.271
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:08:55.271 --> 00:08:55.821
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it,</v>

150
00:08:55.821 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

151
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 3>can be Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be kinda spooky at night.</v>

152
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are great cities and Canadian </v>

153
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Canada is much more urbanized place in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>

154
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Canadians are more likely to live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto,</v>

155
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Calgary,</v>

156
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Edmonton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montreal,</v>

157
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 3>those places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

158
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.120
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

159
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a line from a poem.</v>

160
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:14.424
<v Speaker 3>The wild is always there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even when you live in the center of </v>

161
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 3>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be mauled by a lion.</v>

162
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.343
<v Speaker 3>You can head off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can start driving and pretty soon </v>

163
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.660
<v Speaker 3>you're in the wild.</v>

164
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

165
00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So your mom was on the Canadian </v>

<v Speaker 3>Corporation.</v>

168

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

171

<v Speaker 3>learn from as a member of the Canadian </v>

<v Speaker 3>Senate.</v>

173
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.713
<v Speaker 3>Conservative Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

174
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.460
<v Speaker 3>my late mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barbara from was the host.</v>

176
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 3>I was just testing you on your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>biography.</v>

177
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.401
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was,</v>

178
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a radio interview on a show called as it</v>

179
00:09:58.081 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 3>happens for a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

180
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

181
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 3>was the founder of a show called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>journal,</v>

182
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:02.634
<v Speaker 3>which was one of those face to face TV </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows at a time when satellite in </v>

183
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.210
<v Speaker 3>satellite communication was quite knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>she died in 1992 at the age of 54.</v>

184
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Was Your family always political?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

185
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like probably right.</v>

186
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family was interested in politics.</v>

187
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.160
<v Speaker 3>My late father was a businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a,</v>

188
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.120
<v Speaker 3>not involved in the political world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a lot of distance from,</v>

189
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 3>from politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

190
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.973
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

191
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 3>my parents dinner table was a place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a high pressure environment.</v>

192
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.440
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

193
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 3>they thought deeply about things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were not ideological.</v>

194
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.533
<v Speaker 3>And one of the places where I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean learn to think was around that </v>

195
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:38.440
<v Speaker 3>dinner table because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

196
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:39.853
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

197
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 3>my mother is very skeptical about </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

198
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 3>including her own children and the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

199
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 3>when you were saying something she </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't like,</v>

200
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 3>but she would never argue with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

201
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.613
<v Speaker 3>you just set marching these two lines of</v>
<v Speaker 3>interrogatory questions and you would </v>

202
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:53.394
<v Speaker 3>eventually realized I'm caught between </v>
<v Speaker 3>these two lines and she would force you </v>

203
00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 3>to think more deeply about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not just political things but uh,</v>

204
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 3>but everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you do that?</v>

205
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Why do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that's funny?</v>

206
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.673
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

207
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.590
<v Speaker 3>it made you a more conscious person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

208
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 3>and I try to live up to that and the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>I raise my own children,</v>

209
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:12.603
<v Speaker 3>you never try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try never to tell them what to do or </v>

210
00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:15.840
<v Speaker 3>what they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to think,</v>

211
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:16.674
<v Speaker 3>but instead to challenge them to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to think more deeply and not just </v>

212
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 3>about the big things but everything.</v>

213
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.673
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally missing in society right </v>

214
00:11:25.841 --> 00:11:26.141
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

215
00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it's what I try to bring to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

216
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:29.104
<v Speaker 1>I try to let my guest talk even when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with them and maybe poke and </v>

217
00:11:32.171 --> 00:11:34.570
<v Speaker 1>prod them in ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn a little bit more,</v>

218
00:11:34.571 --> 00:11:35.404
<v Speaker 1>but that everyone in the media these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days is just pounding at each other and </v>

219
00:11:39.251 --> 00:11:40.084
<v Speaker 1>hitting each other and trying to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other instead of sort of going </v>

220
00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:44.134
<v Speaker 1>along that journey with you and figuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>out why you think that way and more </v>

221
00:11:46.841 --> 00:11:48.310
<v Speaker 1>importantly how you think.</v>

222
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.990
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just human nature.</v>

223
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

224
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.600
<v Speaker 3>I think it's human nature to be tough on</v>
<v Speaker 3>others and soft on ourselves and uh,</v>

225
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.020
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real discipline and um,</v>

226
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>

227
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:01.804
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should be soft on others and </v>

228
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 3>tough on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's an interesting story.</v>

229
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:10.531
<v Speaker 3>I want to get this totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were 14 you volunteered for the</v>

230
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Ontario New Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

231
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.270
<v Speaker 3>So far so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So far so good.</v>

232
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 3>And for those who don't follow Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics as closely.</v>

233
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 3>So the Ontario MD,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the NDP is the left party in Canada,</v>

234
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a multiparty system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

235
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.113
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a candidate of course has a </v>

236
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 3>parliamentary system and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>provincial election and I was interested</v>

237
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 3>in seeing how politics worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't,</v>

238
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.363
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really have political ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was interested in campaigns and I </v>

239
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.780
<v Speaker 3>volunteered on that campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on that campaign,</v>

240
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.790
<v Speaker 3>you're 14 years old and on your commute </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're reading the Gulag archipelago?</v>

241
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

242
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.840
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a bus,</v>

243
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.470
<v Speaker 3>subway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>streetcar to go.</v>

244
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.100
<v Speaker 3>It was really something for a volunteer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

245
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:48.934
<v Speaker 3>It was summer holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my mother had given me as a </v>

246
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:51.484
<v Speaker 3>birthday present,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the paperback edition of the Gulag </v>

247
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.353
<v Speaker 3>Archipelago and urged me to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I had a lot of time on that </v>

248
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:00.970
<v Speaker 3>commute and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had,</v>

249
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.680
<v Speaker 3>it hit me like a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

250
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.761
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

251
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean my family in know are,</v>

252
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 3>were not my parents got out of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family,</v>

253
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 3>my family's got out of Europe before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>

254
00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:16.640
<v Speaker 3>but they left people behind and so in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Polish.</v>

255
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.840
<v Speaker 3>So most of my father's family were </v>
<v Speaker 3>annihilated in the Holocaust and a very.</v>

256
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 3>So that was something he was always very</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious in my mind.</v>

257
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.590
<v Speaker 3>And then here was this other story that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I had not heard so much about it.</v>

258
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.453
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

259
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shaped me.</v>

260
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.930
<v Speaker 3>How does that shape a 14 year old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

261
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.813
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

262
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.343
<v Speaker 3>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes you aware of is that human </v>

263
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:40.240
<v Speaker 3>history is very tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

264
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.283
<v Speaker 3>that you can't really rely that power </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be abused and it makes you begin to </v>

265
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:47.170
<v Speaker 3>think very hard about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

266
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:48.004
<v Speaker 3>how do we build a society?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there I was on the Toronto subway </v>

267
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:51.394
<v Speaker 3>system in a society that really worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it forces you to think most </v>

268
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 3>societies aren't like this in most </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies.</v>

269
00:13:56.201 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 3>People are exposed to random terror and </v>
<v Speaker 3>too dictatorial power.</v>

270
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.173
<v Speaker 3>How do you make societies that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that work in the protect people and </v>

271
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:06.260
<v Speaker 3>respect human dignity and human freedom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

272
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.220
<v Speaker 3>so I began and of course at 14 you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>no answers,</v>

273
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 3>but you made you become interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the question.</v>

274
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 3>And what you also know is that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

275
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I have a great scheme for humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just requires a few prison camps.</v>

276
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.061
<v Speaker 3>You learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

277
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not such a good scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

278
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Although they usually don't tell you it </v>
<v Speaker 3>requires prison gifts.</v>

279
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:28.210
<v Speaker 3>It usually tells you it requires a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of good things,</v>

280
00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:28.841
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

281
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:31.560
<v Speaker 3>isn't that the real trick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it generally.</v>

282
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 3>But it tells you at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm at you.</v>

283
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:37.320
<v Speaker 3>There are warnings early on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

284
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.670
<v Speaker 3>their warnings early on in any utopian </v>
<v Speaker 3>project like that.</v>

285
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.110
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

286
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.073
<v Speaker 3>break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>break some eggs here to make her an </v>

287
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Omelet at first year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

288
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.480
<v Speaker 3>At first the eggs or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

289
00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 3>and at first the eggs are kind of small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

290
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first.</v>

291
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 3>But you can tell those steps and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that,</v>

292
00:14:56.901 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

293
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>

294
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.423
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at what's happening on campuses </v>

295
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 3>with such alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

296
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.843
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously those are the people who are </v>

297
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 3>shouting down people on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have police forces,</v>

298
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.800
<v Speaker 1>but they've made it pretty clear how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they ever did have a police force,</v>

299
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.540
<v Speaker 1>how they use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

300
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.003
<v Speaker 1>So when I first came across you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably maybe 10 years </v>

301
00:15:21.271 --> 00:15:22.104
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were on realtime a lot and I would </v>

302
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:26.280
<v Speaker 1>say I would just see you on different </v>
<v Speaker 1>television and it was probably when,</v>

303
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.210
<v Speaker 1>for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a little more left than maybe I am</v>

304
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.340
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

305
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.293
<v Speaker 1>or at least the whole overton window has</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shifted that it's hard to put </v>

306
00:15:35.521 --> 00:15:37.500
<v Speaker 1>anyone on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the traditional map anymore,</v>

307
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.513
<v Speaker 1>but I always sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always struck me as like a sensible </v>

308
00:15:40.411 --> 00:15:42.600
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never watched you and was like,</v>

309
00:15:42.601 --> 00:15:43.434
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy I disagree with on the </v>

310
00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:45.150
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:50.010
<v Speaker 1>in some like crazed way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does conservatism because you,</v>

312
00:15:50.011 --> 00:15:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you are a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

313
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.150
<v Speaker 1>I would say I would use the adjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am conservative.</v>

314
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I stopped using the noun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A conservative.</v>

315
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.983
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting distinction and </v>

316
00:15:59.431 --> 00:16:01.560
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to me relative to so many</v>

317
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 1>things changing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does conservatism generally meet?</v>

318
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.443
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it starts with the way our </v>

319
00:16:08.161 --> 00:16:10.560
<v Speaker 3>brains are built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are people who,</v>

320
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.673
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are more conscious of risk and their </v>

321
00:16:13.381 --> 00:16:17.190
<v Speaker 3>people are less conscious of risk that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who hanker for change,</v>

322
00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:21.270
<v Speaker 3>there are people who are ready to stick </v>
<v Speaker 3>with president evils rather than try new</v>

323
00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:23.970
<v Speaker 3>ones and that's just a matter of brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemistry.</v>

324
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.333
<v Speaker 3>Then when people with those different </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain chemistry approach the problems </v>

325
00:16:29.971 --> 00:16:33.120
<v Speaker 3>with society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start building systems of ideas.</v>

326
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.380
<v Speaker 3>So the reason I stopped using the phrase</v>
<v Speaker 3>a conservative and stopped talking about</v>

327
00:16:37.381 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 3>the conservative movement is what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would've called conservatives.</v>

328
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:42.374
<v Speaker 3>And when I came out of college in 1982 </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a set of answers to the problems in </v>

329
00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:48.180
<v Speaker 3>the 19 seventies and eighties inflation </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime,</v>

330
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Soviet menace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the disorder in American life.</v>

331
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.793
<v Speaker 3>I'm sluggish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Productivity growth and the </v>

332
00:16:54.331 --> 00:16:55.164
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives have those days had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>series of policy recommendations for </v>

333
00:16:57.511 --> 00:16:58.344
<v Speaker 3>those problems.</v>

334
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.500
<v Speaker 3>And by and large they worked and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>result was that the problems either were</v>

335
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.620
<v Speaker 3>overcome or anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so reduced insignificance.</v>

336
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.830
<v Speaker 3>They stopped being the most important </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems that Americans cared about.</v>

337
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.580
<v Speaker 3>New problems came to the fore and about </v>
<v Speaker 3>those new problems,</v>

338
00:17:14.581 --> 00:17:19.581
<v Speaker 3>conservatives had the same old answers </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had back in 1982 and it became a</v>

339
00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:20.574
<v Speaker 3>kind of fetish that if lower taxes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right way to respond to low </v>

340
00:17:26.401 --> 00:17:27.234
<v Speaker 3>productivity growth in 1982,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then if you had completely different </v>

341
00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:34.980
<v Speaker 3>problems in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then obviously still lower taxes.</v>

342
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.933
<v Speaker 3>Must be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Must work just as well as they did with </v>

343
00:17:37.981 --> 00:17:40.380
<v Speaker 3>a completely different set of problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1982.</v>

344
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

345
00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I think what has happened is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative movement,</v>

346
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.550
<v Speaker 3>conservative politics is a fossil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

347
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting in that it reveal,</v>

348
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:51.204
<v Speaker 3>it's like an earthing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some piece of rock from a different </v>

349
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 3>geological era.</v>

350
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.990
<v Speaker 3>It tells you something about what people</v>
<v Speaker 3>had on their minds in 1982.</v>

351
00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.123
<v Speaker 3>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to solve the problems of </v>

352
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 3>2018,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so helpful.</v>

353
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when people say that are </v>

354
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:08.760
<v Speaker 3>conservatives now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that have any particular meaning to</v>

355
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:09.211
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

356
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I guess there is the set that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about from [inaudible] 82 that's</v>

357
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:13.820
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

358
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.130
<v Speaker 3>what the answers are then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that seems very different from now.</v>

359
00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:17.964
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're obviously gonna spend a lot of </v>

360
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:20.880
<v Speaker 3>time talking about trump and that really</v>
<v Speaker 3>has flipped this on it.</v>

361
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.433
<v Speaker 3>This is what has made trump possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why the conservative movement </v>

362
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:29.391
<v Speaker 3>has sort of worked itself out of a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the actual content of conservatism,</v>

363
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.523
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is conservatism have to say about </v>

364
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 3>the opioid epidemic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it have to say about,</v>

365
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

366
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.090
<v Speaker 3>the great recession.</v>

367
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.923
<v Speaker 3>What does it have to say about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse in life expectancy among non </v>

368
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 3>college Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it have to say about America's</v>

369
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:47.334
<v Speaker 3>place in the world in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a world in which we're no longer </v>

370
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 3>competing with an ideological nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>superpower of the Soviet Union,</v>

371
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:53.274
<v Speaker 3>but with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

372
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 3>with these opportunistic actors that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have like Russia and China,</v>

373
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.953
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as conservatism has become more useless </v>

374
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.270
<v Speaker 3>to help those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

375
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 3>what has been left behind is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude.</v>

376
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.520
<v Speaker 3>What conservatism I think means to most </v>
<v Speaker 3>people say I'm a conservative because it</v>

377
00:19:08.521 --> 00:19:10.440
<v Speaker 3>means anti leftism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out what the,</v>

378
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.230
<v Speaker 3>what the American left is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>at any given moment,</v>

379
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.843
<v Speaker 3>and not only think the opposite of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually make your opposition to </v>

380
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That group of people,</v>

381
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 3>the organizing principle of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

382
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of defining principle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically you're defining principle.</v>

383
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Now what that does is first it makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does a couple things.</v>

384
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.633
<v Speaker 3>First,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes oppositionists it means you're </v>

385
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:34.914
<v Speaker 3>always against never four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the second thing it means is you </v>

386
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:40.770
<v Speaker 3>never have the initiative because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what you think about anything</v>

387
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.843
<v Speaker 3>until somebody else tells you first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's one of the reasons </v>

388
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 3>why conservatives were so vulnerable to </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

389
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.753
<v Speaker 3>is that you had an intellectual with </v>
<v Speaker 3>state that was largely untended and </v>

390
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.823
<v Speaker 3>falling into disrepair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Donald trump came and kicked the </v>

391
00:19:57.841 --> 00:19:58.674
<v Speaker 3>door down and moved in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were there any candidates that you like </v>

392
00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:06.370
<v Speaker 3>that of that crew before trump came in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wreck the whole thing up?</v>

393
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there've been a lot of,</v>

394
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

395
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I've almost always supported,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well until 2069,</v>

396
00:20:11.301 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 3>always supported the Republican nominee </v>
<v Speaker 3>for president.</v>

397
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.350
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought there were,</v>

398
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.363
<v Speaker 3>there have been a lot of people who have</v>
<v Speaker 3>had real promise to make a good </v>

399
00:20:20.581 --> 00:20:22.470
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitt Romney would have made a very,</v>

400
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 3>very good president.</v>

401
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Conservatism's problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Republican isn't a problem,</v>

402
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:27.624
<v Speaker 3>has been that you take people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have real promise as leaders and you </v>

403
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:37.490
<v Speaker 3>then connect them to a program that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't win a democratic election.</v>

404
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Know since the end of the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives want the,</v>

405
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.873
<v Speaker 3>the Republican nominee for president has</v>
<v Speaker 3>won a majority of the popular vote </v>

406
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:51.220
<v Speaker 3>exactly once and that was in 2004 in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of nine slash 11.</v>

407
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

408
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.933
<v Speaker 3>it's no longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no longer a national majority </v>

409
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.510
<v Speaker 3>for what Republicans are offering and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what has happened.</v>

410
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.350
<v Speaker 3>And it's no surprise because when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

411
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.193
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our big ideas to take the medicare </v>

412
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:03.934
<v Speaker 3>guarantee away from everybody under 55 </v>
<v Speaker 3>to put Medicaid on the path toward </v>

413
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:08.404
<v Speaker 3>extinction and to use all of that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>finance more tax cuts like those that </v>

414
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:12.724
<v Speaker 3>worked in the 19 eighties in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different set of </v>

415
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:19.240
<v Speaker 3>circumstances that you're not talking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>or about me.</v>

416
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:20.663
<v Speaker 3>I'm so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have been committed to an </v>

417
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.820
<v Speaker 3>unworkable program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what has happened then,</v>

418
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been that as Republicans have lost,</v>

419
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 3>the parties become more desperate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more vulnerable.</v>

420
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.253
<v Speaker 3>But what has also happened is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have had an increasingly self-conscious </v>

421
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 3>move and the conservative world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of the trump ocracy,</v>

422
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk about in the book to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

423
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.300
<v Speaker 3>if we can't win a majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

424
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.063
<v Speaker 3>what we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to cope with that by </v>

425
00:21:52.721 --> 00:21:56.110
<v Speaker 3>redefining who the proper people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're going to define the country.</v>

426
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.123
<v Speaker 3>We're going to shrink our definition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are the people and divide the </v>

427
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:03.010
<v Speaker 3>country between the people and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and the p.</v>

428
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.970
<v Speaker 3>and if we have a majority of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all we care about and we're going</v>

429
00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:06.804
<v Speaker 3>to try to find ways to prevent those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people from participating and even </v>

430
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:10.090
<v Speaker 3>voting.</v>

431
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:10.923
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of things here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting you mentioned taxes </v>

432
00:22:12.441 --> 00:22:14.300
<v Speaker 1>a couple of times and generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

433
00:22:14.301 --> 00:22:18.050
<v Speaker 1>when I have conservative sit across from</v>
<v Speaker 1>me there for tax cuts no matter what.</v>

434
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.913
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was the 82 crew basically </v>

435
00:22:21.261 --> 00:22:22.094
<v Speaker 1>that was born and then this fossil </v>
<v Speaker 1>remained and people are always for it </v>

436
00:22:24.331 --> 00:22:25.120
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

437
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.560
<v Speaker 1>it's rare to sit across from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

438
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.513
<v Speaker 1>And you're basically saying that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are instances at least where the tax </v>

439
00:22:31.971 --> 00:22:33.110
<v Speaker 1>cuts are not a problem.</v>

440
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

441
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.510
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the really damaging things,</v>

442
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.450
<v Speaker 3>societies have states states need </v>
<v Speaker 3>revenue.</v>

443
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

444
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>

445
00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.330
<v Speaker 3>there are things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are ways,</v>

446
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States might not need so much</v>

447
00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:49.830
<v Speaker 3>tax money if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

448
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.733
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't spend twice as twice as much </v>

449
00:22:52.801 --> 00:22:56.370
<v Speaker 3>per person on healthcare as everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else in the world.</v>

450
00:22:56.371 --> 00:22:58.790
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the actual dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States spends on,</v>

451
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.680
<v Speaker 3>on pro health provision for terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>results,</v>

452
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very expensive.</v>

453
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.253
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives by and large are not </v>

454
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.680
<v Speaker 3>interested in getting their fingers into</v>
<v Speaker 3>that problem.</v>

455
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.063
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the government needs revenue and it </v>

456
00:23:12.061 --> 00:23:15.600
<v Speaker 3>has to be funded and part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fossilization happens.</v>

457
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.980
<v Speaker 3>Conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say you say,</v>

458
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.830
<v Speaker 3>we've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm whatever it is.</v>

459
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.540
<v Speaker 3>And the concern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

460
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.080
<v Speaker 3>if I can solve it with a tax cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm for doing something.</v>

461
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:29.220
<v Speaker 3>If I can only solve it by having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending increase of that,</v>

462
00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:30.054
<v Speaker 3>I won't do anything.</v>

463
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.520
<v Speaker 3>What then happens is cynical operators </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

464
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.873
<v Speaker 3>what if we take our spending increase </v>
<v Speaker 3>and instead of doing it through an </v>

465
00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:40.860
<v Speaker 3>appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do it through a tax credit.</v>

466
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.600
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

467
00:23:42.601 --> 00:23:43.434
<v Speaker 3>then I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the result is that wasn't the </v>

468
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 3>problem is housing or higher education </v>
<v Speaker 3>or caring for disabled children,</v>

469
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 3>that conservatives can be sold a </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution in the form of a tax credit,</v>

470
00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 3>which is usually the least efficient way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of solving a problem.</v>

471
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:05.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the result is that you get this kind</v>

472
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:05.954
<v Speaker 3>of malformed state where the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States has a really big and expensive </v>

473
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:09.854
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's financed and especially in </v>

474
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:14.300
<v Speaker 3>efficient ways and it addresses problems</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially inefficient ways.</v>

475
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.440
<v Speaker 1>So is the first part there though that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody actually cut spending,</v>

476
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:19.274
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had Ben Shapiro in here a bunch of </v>

477
00:24:20.181 --> 00:24:21.014
<v Speaker 1>times and that's what he talks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can keep raising taxes forever </v>

478
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:24.314
<v Speaker 1>and ever and ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that really we have this just giant </v>

479
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 1>monstrosity of a government that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly inefficient.</v>

480
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean even healthcare side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just everything,</v>

481
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:37.271
<v Speaker 1>all the mid level bureaus and regulators</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just this massive federal government</v>

482
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:38.594
<v Speaker 1>that was never supposed to get so big </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we never actually really look at </v>

483
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 1>how much of that we could chop away at </v>
<v Speaker 1>were then if we did a little of that,</v>

484
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:48.650
<v Speaker 1>we could have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of relevant conversations about</v>

485
00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 1>tax cuts that you're talking about.</v>

486
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Well that's partly true and partly not </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>

487
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.273
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the government spend its money </v>

488
00:24:58.391 --> 00:25:02.800
<v Speaker 3>on defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Medicare,</v>

489
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Medicaid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social security.</v>

490
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I think that's those things together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's about 80 percent.</v>

491
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

492
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the government,</v>

493
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:14.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

494
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:15.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

495
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I think it's true that dollar for </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar,</v>

496
00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:20.980
<v Speaker 3>the US government is less efficient than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that of other countries.</v>

497
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly because of the inheritance of not</v>

498
00:25:23.771 --> 00:25:24.604
<v Speaker 3>having a proper civil service that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that president starts off by </v>

499
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:30.370
<v Speaker 3>appointing the top 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs in the civil service.</v>

500
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.463
<v Speaker 3>So it's highly political and you get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people who shouldn't basically </v>

501
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.720
<v Speaker 3>have no background in government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what they're doing and things</v>

502
00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:39.700
<v Speaker 3>are not done in a very efficient way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

503
00:25:39.701 --> 00:25:40.534
<v Speaker 3>the power of Congress means there are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people were always trying to put </v>

504
00:25:43.901 --> 00:25:46.220
<v Speaker 3>in some special benefit and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen that don't make.</v>

505
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.850
<v Speaker 3>So you have military bases in places </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they shouldn't be.</v>

506
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.140
<v Speaker 3>But if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

507
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 3>this is why I say conservatism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsolete if you want to reduce the state</v>

508
00:25:56.901 --> 00:25:58.150
<v Speaker 3>share of expense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really,</v>

509
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean not just by repackaging things as</v>
<v Speaker 3>tax that are,</v>

510
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that um,</v>

511
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways we,</v>

512
00:26:05.321 --> 00:26:06.154
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fund the care of disabled children is </v>

513
00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:09.544
<v Speaker 3>through a series of tax credits that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not labeled as expenditures but really </v>

514
00:26:13.421 --> 00:26:16.510
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do something by Medicare and</v>

515
00:26:16.511 --> 00:26:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Medicaid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the conservative,</v>

516
00:26:17.821 --> 00:26:18.910
<v Speaker 3>the idea has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

517
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:19.744
<v Speaker 3>well the answer is we're going to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>away Medicare and Medicaid from people </v>

518
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.153
<v Speaker 3>and the reason that the Obama period has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been such a crisis and the period </v>

519
00:26:27.311 --> 00:26:28.144
<v Speaker 3>afterwards is the defeat over the defeat</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the conservative attempt to repeal </v>

520
00:26:33.851 --> 00:26:34.684
<v Speaker 3>the affordable care act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to pass the Ryan plan means the </v>

521
00:26:37.781 --> 00:26:38.614
<v Speaker 3>conservatives have to face a world in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which the United States has joined the </v>

522
00:26:41.231 --> 00:26:42.064
<v Speaker 3>other developed countries and having </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like or something closer to a </v>

523
00:26:45.301 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 3>universal healthcare guarantee.</v>

524
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:47.603
<v Speaker 3>The old idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll save money just by not covering </v>

525
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:50.274
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not going to be workable in the </v>

526
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:53.934
<v Speaker 3>politics of the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that means you have to actually pay </v>

527
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:57.984
<v Speaker 3>attention to how Medicare works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have to say how while covering </v>

528
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:04.770
<v Speaker 3>everybody do we squeeze costs out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and that requires a commitment to</v>

529
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:05.604
<v Speaker 3>policy detail that conservatives don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to do is they like the sweeping </v>

530
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 3>comment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just need to cut all this waste.</v>

531
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.790
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say,</v>

532
00:27:14.791 --> 00:27:16.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is the waste of Medicare?</v>

533
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:17.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer is,</v>

534
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:18.690
<v Speaker 3>would the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

535
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 3>overpays for all of these services,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

536
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.690
<v Speaker 3>per unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

537
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.673
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors make more money in the United </v>

538
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.460
<v Speaker 3>States than they do in other places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a,</v>

539
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.610
<v Speaker 3>you have these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

540
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:33.223
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also have this problem if you </v>

541
00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 3>have a sicker population than not people</v>
<v Speaker 3>do in other countries.</v>

542
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Americans die earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're less likely to wear seatbelts.</v>

543
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have more gun accidents.</v>

544
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.223
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to delve to deal with this </v>

545
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:45.804
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to delve into detail in a way </v>

546
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:47.574
<v Speaker 3>that the conservative preference for </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology over factual specificity makes </v>

547
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 3>conservatives not very useful at.</v>

548
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Is anyone good at that these days </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

549
00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Really like really saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

550
00:28:00.051 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the real grass root </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement on both sides,</v>

551
00:28:02.811 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean Bernie was pretty extreme left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trump was w,</v>

552
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:07.580
<v Speaker 1>whatever I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to call extreme right,</v>

553
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.560
<v Speaker 1>but what we'll get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you call that,</v>

554
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.510
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the wrecking of the system.</v>

555
00:28:11.511 --> 00:28:13.180
<v Speaker 1>So you had these two competing forces.</v>

556
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.063
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of political messianism </v>

557
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.720
<v Speaker 3>that's a really important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here I'm here.</v>

558
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Let me put a set of looking at what at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the two sides.</v>

559
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.193
<v Speaker 3>If you were to take the 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the United States who know </v>

560
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 3>most about Medicare and Medicaid are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred who know most about Medicare and</v>

561
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:33.621
<v Speaker 3>Medicaid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing 90 of the hundred and 9,990</v>

562
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 3>of the thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not 900,000</v>

563
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.303
<v Speaker 3>would be people of the center left </v>
<v Speaker 3>because conservatives just don't care </v>

564
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.860
<v Speaker 3>about that kind of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they're always at a disadvantage.</v>

565
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.753
<v Speaker 1>So is it that they don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't think the government </v>

566
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:53.130
<v Speaker 1>should be involved in it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental worst.</v>

567
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

568
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.573
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the job of the government </v>

569
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:56.080
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

570
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.913
<v Speaker 3>but they know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so every once in a while somebody will </v>

571
00:28:58.721 --> 00:28:59.554
<v Speaker 3>put his head above the parapet and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the government should be </v>

572
00:29:01.061 --> 00:29:02.590
<v Speaker 3>providing healthcare for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

573
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.873
<v Speaker 3>You lose an election that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is how Donald Trump became the </v>

574
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:07.000
<v Speaker 3>republican nominee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

575
00:29:07.001 --> 00:29:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Paul Ryan does not think the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>should provide healthcare to everybody.</v>

576
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.800
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the Republican primary </v>
<v Speaker 3>voter thinks the gut.</v>

577
00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government should provide healthcare</v>

578
00:29:16.031 --> 00:29:16.864
<v Speaker 3>to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they should provide healthcare to </v>

579
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.330
<v Speaker 3>everyone like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

580
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.530
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

581
00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:23.523
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should provide healthcare to all </v>

582
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.673
<v Speaker 3>the over 65.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should provide healthcare to all </v>

583
00:29:26.171 --> 00:29:28.300
<v Speaker 3>the veterans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once you do that,</v>

584
00:29:28.301 --> 00:29:31.090
<v Speaker 3>you're into a very big program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you're saying government should</v>

585
00:29:31.091 --> 00:29:31.924
<v Speaker 3>provide healthcare to all the over 65.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's where most of the spending </v>

586
00:29:34.301 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 3>takes place anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

587
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.273
<v Speaker 1>nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an ideological difference with </v>

588
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:39.044
<v Speaker 1>maybe the Paul Ryan approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you think it's a legitimate of </v>

589
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>looking at the</v>

590
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.873
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

591
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.610
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to put words in your mouth,</v>

592
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 3>but I don't understand what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a way to think,</v>

593
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.903
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

594
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could argue that point,</v>

595
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.423
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a way that a political </v>
<v Speaker 3>party wants to compete for power in the </v>

596
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.750
<v Speaker 3>United States can think because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>voters won't accept it.</v>

597
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.850
<v Speaker 3>So what ends up happening is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans have a bunch of commitment,</v>

598
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:04.773
<v Speaker 3>they have a bunch of theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 3>commitments and a bunch of operational </v>

599
00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:10.900
<v Speaker 3>commitments and those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't line up,</v>

600
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:12.003
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in fact the Republican Party does </v>

601
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:15.514
<v Speaker 3>maintain Medicare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does make maintain medicaid and it </v>

602
00:30:17.641 --> 00:30:20.560
<v Speaker 3>tries to find little economies usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>not very efficient ways,</v>

603
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.563
<v Speaker 3>but the result is because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>care about how those problems work and </v>

604
00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:28.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not psychically committed to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no one there saying we're going</v>

605
00:30:28.341 --> 00:30:29.174
<v Speaker 3>to cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to.</v>

606
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.470
<v Speaker 3>How is it that Germany and France and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Switzerland,</v>

607
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 3>the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

608
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.493
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cover more people have longer life </v>

609
00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:40.270
<v Speaker 3>expectancies and spend less.</v>

610
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

611
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.293
<v Speaker 3>the difference between what the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States spends the difference of the </v>

612
00:30:47.021 --> 00:30:47.854
<v Speaker 3>American spending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American economy and healthcare and </v>

613
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:51.790
<v Speaker 3>that of the other developed countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about three,</v>

614
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.850
<v Speaker 3>three or four points of GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is bigger than the defense budget.</v>

615
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 3>So what does that say then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just about.</v>

616
00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 3>We don't even have to make this about </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative per se.</v>

617
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 3>What does that say about our system?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a guy came up,</v>

618
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 3>let's say a Republican nominee came up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and really was talking about that.</v>

619
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.500
<v Speaker 3>I talk that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ins and outs.</v>

620
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:09.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what,</v>

621
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.200
<v Speaker 3>let's just look at 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

622
00:31:11.201 --> 00:31:12.034
<v Speaker 3>he would have been clubbed over the head</v>
<v Speaker 3>by trauma and they still the trump </v>

623
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:18.830
<v Speaker 3>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump said trump is a.</v>

624
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.710
<v Speaker 3>was a great disco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>

625
00:31:20.711 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 3>This is what I mean by the hollowness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So trump set,</v>

626
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.023
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to protect Medicare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to protect Medicaid trump </v>

627
00:31:27.671 --> 00:31:29.920
<v Speaker 3>campaign as the guy who's going to.</v>

628
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.903
<v Speaker 3>Who was the first Republican who really </v>
<v Speaker 3>made his peace with the American social </v>

629
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:36.034
<v Speaker 3>insurance system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When conservatives said trump wasn't a </v>

630
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:38.374
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were right and that's why he beat </v>

631
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:41.734
<v Speaker 3>them inside their own party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump begins by beating the republican </v>

632
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:46.270
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd been.</v>

633
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.810
<v Speaker 3>He begins by defeating Fox News and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bending all of them to his will.</v>

634
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Now he had no idea what he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

635
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.700
<v Speaker 3>He had no plan for executing any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

636
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.833
<v Speaker 3>but he do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that's really true because I </v>

637
00:31:56.891 --> 00:31:57.724
<v Speaker 3>hear this with a lot of people that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had either no idea what he was doing or </v>

638
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:04.480
<v Speaker 3>no plan or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who has no idea.</v>

639
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 3>He reveals that every day he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

640
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.450
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what does that say about all of us?</v>

641
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.790
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if one of the.</v>

642
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 3>One of the interviewers had said during </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Mr Trump,</v>

643
00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 3>you say you're going to preserve </v>
<v Speaker 3>Medicare and Medicaid.</v>

644
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.920
<v Speaker 3>What does Medicare do and what does </v>
<v Speaker 3>Medicaid do and what's the difference?</v>

645
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.113
<v Speaker 3>I will bet you I'm the amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Republican Party are going to </v>

646
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.260
<v Speaker 3>corruptly put in his pockets of Maro </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lago,</v>

647
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.850
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't have answered that </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

648
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that.</v>

649
00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:37.000
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a video before the election saying</v>

650
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 3>if you want to stump trump asking him </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the three branches of government</v>

651
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.023
<v Speaker 1>are and what they're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was asked what the three elements of </v>

652
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:44.770
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear triad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

653
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that kind of stuff.</v>

654
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I do agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this thing about sort of,</v>

655
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.860
<v Speaker 1>there was no plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no point in some way.</v>

656
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Even if even if I can intellectually get</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with you,</v>

657
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:57.900
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he duped by me.</v>

658
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.470
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say it's pretty scary to</v>

659
00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:04.850
<v Speaker 1>think that someone who had no plan dupe </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us like that,</v>

660
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 1>that inherently seems like a planet at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some level because we're sort of talking</v>

661
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:09.200
<v Speaker 1>about plans at different levels.</v>

662
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.033
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don Donald trump is one of the great </v>

663
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:13.790
<v Speaker 3>scam artists of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He scammed the people trump university.</v>

664
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:15.403
<v Speaker 3>He and the scan was possible because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the disillusionment of so many people </v>

665
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.790
<v Speaker 3>with a responsible politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>

666
00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.130
<v Speaker 3>when he intuited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

667
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he dumped trump has certain talents</v>

668
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:33.390
<v Speaker 3>and geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

669
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.273
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is a genius at finding the weakness </v>

670
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:36.913
<v Speaker 3>in things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he understood the weakness in the </v>

671
00:33:38.431 --> 00:33:39.264
<v Speaker 3>institutional Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that they were offering a </v>

672
00:33:41.601 --> 00:33:42.434
<v Speaker 3>message that their own voters hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have a lot of detail on that in </v>

673
00:33:45.561 --> 00:33:49.100
<v Speaker 3>the book about how when you actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed Republican voters,</v>

674
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Republican primary voters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Paul Ryan wanted to do,</v>

675
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 3>we just recoiled from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's gonna take away my medicare,</v>

676
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:57.890
<v Speaker 3>he's going to take away my mother's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nursing home.</v>

677
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.170
<v Speaker 3>That's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the famous Ryan plant.</v>

678
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.750
<v Speaker 3>So Donald Trump understood that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That and what he then understood as well</v>

679
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:10.930
<v Speaker 3>was that in the absence of a program </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this anti leftism that can become a</v>

680
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:12.254
<v Speaker 3>conservative conservatism was this was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>series of resentments and rages that </v>

681
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 3>we're waiting for somebody who could </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate who,</v>

682
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.850
<v Speaker 3>who raged and presented as powerfully as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>

683
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the previous Republican nominees with </v>

684
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 3>sometimes tap these feelings trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>channel them,</v>

685
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't share them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump shares them.</v>

686
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before we go fully into drop and then</v>

687
00:34:37.301 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 1>we're going to spend the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview on trump.</v>

688
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I just wanna talk a little bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern Democrats and the left in general</v>

689
00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:45.490
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of the,</v>

690
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 1>the feeling that he was going for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a pretty legit feeling on</v>

691
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 1>what's happened with the left related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech and the endless hysteria and</v>

692
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:55.400
<v Speaker 1>everyone's a bigot and a racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

693
00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

694
00:34:56.751 --> 00:35:00.270
<v Speaker 1>That feeling I think is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

695
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.070
<v Speaker 1>do you see that as a legit feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

696
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.400
<v Speaker 1>but in our group therapy that feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are legitimate.</v>

697
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not even feeling.</v>

698
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:11.054
<v Speaker 1>I see it as a legit reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that he was talking about </v>

699
00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 1>there is a legit reality.</v>

700
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.123
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will take this w what behind behind </v>

701
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:22.120
<v Speaker 3>all of those things you described is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>new fact and the politics,</v>

702
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 3>the United States in the past 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years,</v>

703
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.553
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that we are moving into a </v>

704
00:35:27.401 --> 00:35:31.780
<v Speaker 3>period of intense intensifying ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition for power,</v>

705
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.070
<v Speaker 3>for money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for the right to say that,</v>

706
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.983
<v Speaker 3>what to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to define what it means to be an </v>

707
00:35:36.191 --> 00:35:37.024
<v Speaker 3>American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the country's made this big gamble </v>

708
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 3>on changing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And across the developed world,</v>

709
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.060
<v Speaker 3>countries like the United States have </v>
<v Speaker 3>made similar gambles.</v>

710
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.123
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proportion of the foreign born in </v>

711
00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Sweden is now as high as in the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

712
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:53.274
<v Speaker 3>The proportion of foreign born in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany's nearly as high as in the </v>

713
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.363
<v Speaker 3>United States that are having massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with their all immigration is </v>

714
00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.100
<v Speaker 3>always a source of massive social </v>
<v Speaker 3>tension.</v>

715
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.053
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do a lot of the immigration happened </v>

716
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:05.994
<v Speaker 3>without anybody ever consciously </v>
<v Speaker 3>intending it and without much of a </v>

717
00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:09.930
<v Speaker 3>debate over it.</v>

718
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.093
<v Speaker 3>And with a refusal to tally costs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits in an accurate way so these </v>

719
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:17.214
<v Speaker 3>countries have been changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you have is then a series of </v>

720
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:25.010
<v Speaker 3>new demands and new resentments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the,</v>

721
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.693
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons that the conservatism</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up with the so out of date is </v>

722
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:30.303
<v Speaker 3>look back in 1985.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The argument between Liberals and </v>

723
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 3>conservatives was basically an argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the economy that,</v>

724
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is true,</v>

725
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:41.220
<v Speaker 3>not just in every developed country we'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

726
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:42.103
<v Speaker 3>you had a party of the people who worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>for wages and the party of the people </v>

727
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:47.180
<v Speaker 3>who own capital assets and work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>salads.</v>

728
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.060
<v Speaker 3>The left were the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose jobs are supported by taxes.</v>

729
00:36:51.061 --> 00:36:53.300
<v Speaker 3>The other people's jobs are supported by</v>
<v Speaker 3>profits.</v>

730
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.080
<v Speaker 3>If you're in management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were on the right.</v>

731
00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:56.670
<v Speaker 3>If you are in a union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are on the left,</v>

732
00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:01.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not to sound sexist about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but essentially your relationship to the</v>

733
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:01.854
<v Speaker 3>means of production was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was this the organizing principle of </v>

734
00:37:05.491 --> 00:37:06.324
<v Speaker 3>politics?</v>

735
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:07.613
<v Speaker 3>What also happened in 1995 was it people</v>
<v Speaker 3>remembered that this kind of politics </v>

736
00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:15.310
<v Speaker 3>could spiral out of control and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen it happened in the 19 thirties and,</v>

737
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.730
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could get fascist movements,</v>

738
00:37:17.731 --> 00:37:22.380
<v Speaker 3>you could get communist movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there were attempts to temper the</v>

739
00:37:22.381 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 3>competition between the wage people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the salary people between the owners and</v>

740
00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:26.700
<v Speaker 3>the workers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

741
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:27.534
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

742
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.380
<v Speaker 3>and so you had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had kind of a continent.</v>

743
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.253
<v Speaker 3>The left accepted a market economy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right excepted to social insurance </v>

744
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:36.060
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what the argument was about.</v>

745
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.630
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we've run on now for </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite some time.</v>

746
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.080
<v Speaker 3>But that has ceased with the collapse of</v>
<v Speaker 3>socialism.</v>

747
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.060
<v Speaker 3>That argument ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

748
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.083
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the modern left is not really a </v>

749
00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:50.530
<v Speaker 3>socialist movement anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>

750
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean people will sometimes use the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word they will have,</v>

751
00:37:53.011 --> 00:37:53.844
<v Speaker 3>but I mean back in 1950 there are people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who really thought that if the </v>

752
00:37:57.841 --> 00:37:58.674
<v Speaker 3>government owned the banks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the banks would make better lending </v>

753
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 3>decisions than they did.</v>

754
00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.310
<v Speaker 3>Then they would have their private.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one thinks that now.</v>

755
00:38:05.311 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think really.</v>

756
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.143
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that there's plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the left that we'll just sort </v>

757
00:38:10.471 --> 00:38:11.304
<v Speaker 3>of incrementally get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get 330 million people in the </v>

758
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so somebody who thinks every.</v>

759
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that if that.</v>

760
00:38:16.291 --> 00:38:18.500
<v Speaker 3>If Bernie was president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that eventually the EU.</v>

761
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.880
<v Speaker 3>I think the creeping movement of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

762
00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Elizabeth Warren,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that do they want to movement?</v>

763
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I think Elizabeth Warren does not want </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government to own the banks.</v>

764
00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:26.004
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she.</v>

765
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.843
<v Speaker 3>I believe that Elizabeth Warren is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government should own the steel </v>

766
00:38:28.861 --> 00:38:29.694
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't believe that government </v>

767
00:38:30.451 --> 00:38:33.060
<v Speaker 3>should own the commanding heights of </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

768
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure she does not bladder that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about owning,</v>

769
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.063
<v Speaker 3>but what about just controlling it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where in effect it's </v>

770
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.590
<v Speaker 3>ownership.</v>

771
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you.</v>

772
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:40.203
<v Speaker 3>I know she thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she thinks they should </v>

773
00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:42.670
<v Speaker 3>manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

774
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she believes in a social market economy.</v>

775
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.833
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were to say to her what is the </v>

776
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:50.040
<v Speaker 3>best run country on earth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She bringing,</v>

777
00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 3>always used to say Denmark was the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>one country.</v>

778
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.043
<v Speaker 3>Denmark is a free market society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got a bigger social insurance </v>

779
00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:56.164
<v Speaker 3>system in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that because the reason he </v>

780
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 3>said that was it was never serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer because he didn't stop caring.</v>

781
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:07.110
<v Speaker 3>But that's not what politics is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What politics is about is in 1985.</v>

782
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.823
<v Speaker 3>If I knew how you made your living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could probably guess how you voted </v>

783
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:13.503
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I know where your grandparents come </v>

784
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:17.590
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how you vote.</v>

785
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 3>So if your grandparents did not belong </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the local ethnic majority,</v>

786
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 3>whether in the United States or Germany </v>
<v Speaker 3>or Britain,</v>

787
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:24.070
<v Speaker 3>you are in the party.</v>

788
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.610
<v Speaker 3>What used to be the lift if your </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandparents do belong,</v>

789
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.481
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

790
00:39:28.481 --> 00:39:30.540
<v Speaker 3>or did belong to the local ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of your,</v>

791
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.890
<v Speaker 3>what is the power of Party of the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>Houston?</v>

792
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.083
<v Speaker 3>And that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however you make your living however </v>

793
00:39:35.591 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 3>much or little money you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was not true in former days.</v>

794
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:40.263
<v Speaker 3>So you have this politics of ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition and that's why politics as </v>

795
00:39:43.511 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why politics are so much more</v>

796
00:39:44.771 --> 00:39:48.880
<v Speaker 3>very long because in the end you with </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

797
00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:51.220
<v Speaker 3>you can always split the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

798
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 3>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you take 20 percent?</v>

799
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.660
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you take 23 percent when?</v>

800
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>28 percent.</v>

801
00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a deal.</v>

802
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.320
<v Speaker 3>But when you're competing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean to be an American?</v>

803
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.050
<v Speaker 3>We haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who gets to define Americanness?</v>

804
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:08.203
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't found a way to split the </v>

805
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:11.950
<v Speaker 3>difference on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And until we do,</v>

806
00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:13.270
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very little politics.</v>

807
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.103
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>

808
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.273
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

809
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.113
<v Speaker 3>when the Sarah payloads and others talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what it means to be a real </v>

810
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:21.280
<v Speaker 3>American and some things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real American,</v>

811
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:22.114
<v Speaker 3>other things are not looking for a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to claim ethnic legitimation that we </v>

812
00:40:28.331 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We may not have the numbers anymore,</v>

813
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 3>but we still define the country and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of the things that's going on.</v>

814
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 3>That's what these political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 3>battles are all about.</v>

815
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:36.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

816
00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:38.840
<v Speaker 3>it's always true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

817
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.073
<v Speaker 3>that there are things people don't say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always things that people don't </v>

818
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:43.654
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if they're free to set their </v>

819
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:45.183
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't say,</v>

820
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.133
<v Speaker 3>how does that happen though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There things that you don't say and who </v>

821
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:50.374
<v Speaker 3>gets to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we're struggling over </v>

822
00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:55.110
<v Speaker 3>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're calling political correctness</v>

823
00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 3>as people saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There used to be a set of rules,</v>

824
00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 3>a of taboos.</v>

825
00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.410
<v Speaker 3>We have a new set of tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want the old taboos to be unto Bu and</v>

826
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:03.244
<v Speaker 3>we want to impose the new Tibu and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the receiving end of that say </v>

827
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:08.560
<v Speaker 3>we like our old taboos and we don't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>these new taboos.</v>

828
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:09.423
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where Donald Trump is coming </v>

829
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:12.874
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an,</v>

830
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.310
<v Speaker 3>if that's a real dispute is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's important,</v>

831
00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:18.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's new and it's dangerous and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know how to manage it.</v>

832
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 3>And we have this deeply opportunistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>actor who's taking advantage of it.</v>

833
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So before we fully dive into that then,</v>

834
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:29.350
<v Speaker 3>what does this show you that our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our brand of multiculturalism,</v>

835
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:32.470
<v Speaker 3>which has worked better than virtually </v>
<v Speaker 3>any state,</v>

836
00:41:32.471 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>European state</v>

837
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v Speaker 1>are our melting pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this tell you that the experiment </v>

838
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 1>is starting to fail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

839
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 1>is this the litmus test for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

840
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what it sounds like.</v>

841
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.473
<v Speaker 1>First American melting pot never worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as Americans told themselves it </v>

842
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:49.610
<v Speaker 1>did in other states.</v>

843
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

844
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:54.523
<v Speaker 3>has had a lot of civic conflict and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>history and not just the civil war and </v>

845
00:41:58.761 --> 00:41:59.594
<v Speaker 3>then later 19th century to the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent labor relations anywhere on </v>

846
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:03.614
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those were often about ethnicity </v>

847
00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.533
<v Speaker 3>that the strykers would be from one </v>
<v Speaker 3>group and the police police who shot </v>

848
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:14.440
<v Speaker 3>them would be from a different group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the strikes will be broken by strike</v>

849
00:42:14.441 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 3>breakers who are from a third group yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

850
00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.093
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but multiculturalism is difficult to do </v>

851
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:21.913
<v Speaker 3>and it's especially difficult to do when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have moved out of the age of mass </v>

852
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:26.600
<v Speaker 3>production and was one thing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing in,</v>

853
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.600
<v Speaker 3>you needed a lot of bodies to run a </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern economy.</v>

854
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:34.040
<v Speaker 3>You don't need so many bodies today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

855
00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.060
<v Speaker 3>and we also live in a world in which </v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas before,</v>

856
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:41.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a lot of pretty average sized</v>

857
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:41.924
<v Speaker 3>rewards today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in a world in which there are </v>

858
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.720
<v Speaker 3>gigantic rewards and not such great </v>
<v Speaker 3>rewards.</v>

859
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.613
<v Speaker 3>And the average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the average person gets is not as </v>

860
00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:54.530
<v Speaker 3>attractive relatively speaking as it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>two generations ago.</v>

861
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.080
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

862
00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Let's dive into this trump guy because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that everything we've talked about</v>

863
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.013
<v Speaker 1>for the first half year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of your answers now are sort of </v>

864
00:43:02.141 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 1>directly related to this guy who saw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness but not to the</v>

865
00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.850
<v Speaker 3>personality of this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to the whole system.</v>

866
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

867
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.400
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take one last attempt to do it on a</v>

868
00:43:11.401 --> 00:43:12.450
<v Speaker 3>wider lens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll go,</v>

869
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:15.530
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

870
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 4>I imagine</v>

871
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:23.050
<v Speaker 3>somebody standing on a timeline and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>center of the timeline is 1990 and uh,</v>

872
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:26.210
<v Speaker 3>they go forward 25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2015,</v>

873
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.310
<v Speaker 3>and maybe they go to sleep and they wake</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

874
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Who are the most important politicians </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the country when they go to sleep?</v>

875
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Bush and Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are the most important politician in</v>

876
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 3>the country in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush and Clinton,</v>

877
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.340
<v Speaker 3>what are they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq and healthcare.</v>

878
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.613
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go back 25 years from 1990 to 1965 </v>

879
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.480
<v Speaker 3>and it's a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an afl cio.</v>

880
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were riots in the cities.</v>

881
00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:49.190
<v Speaker 3>There are liberal Republicans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Segregationist Democrats.</v>

882
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:51.103
<v Speaker 3>So we have had this frozen politics for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time and it was ready to be </v>

883
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:56.060
<v Speaker 3>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Donald Trump,</v>

884
00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 3>the existing Republican party couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>cope with it.</v>

885
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:01.250
<v Speaker 3>And Donald Trump did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He smash the system open.</v>

886
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:06.190
<v Speaker 3>So he's created some opportunities for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>new kind of political arrange,</v>

887
00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 3>an arrangement because the old one had </v>
<v Speaker 3>become so stale.</v>

888
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.230
<v Speaker 3>But what he's also done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the theme of the book,</v>

889
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.070
<v Speaker 3>is He's raising questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just about the way we do politics,</v>

890
00:44:16.071 --> 00:44:16.904
<v Speaker 3>but rather the whole political system </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he is a deeply authoritarian </v>

891
00:44:19.971 --> 00:44:24.080
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His project is authoritarian and the way</v>

892
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:27.230
<v Speaker 3>he governs is not compatible with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule of law society.</v>

893
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It was going to happen one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

894
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's</v>

895
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.813
<v Speaker 3>fair to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where is he so unique or that </v>

896
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:36.980
<v Speaker 3>personality trait or that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

897
00:44:36.981 --> 00:44:37.814
<v Speaker 3>the type of person that would be willing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it is so unique that we have like </v>

898
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like figures all over the western world.</v>

899
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

900
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.863
<v Speaker 3>we have a global crisis of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean unique to our American </v>

901
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:50.664
<v Speaker 3>system because there was no one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though Bernie was actually talking </v>

902
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:53.364
<v Speaker 3>about rattling the system the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why there was some </v>

903
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 3>crossover with their audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have people in,</v>

904
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's geared builders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is Marine Le Pen,</v>

905
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.990
<v Speaker 3>there's the alternative for Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just,</v>

906
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:05.933
<v Speaker 3>we're recording.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a few days before people see </v>

907
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:09.174
<v Speaker 3>this program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an election in Italy in which </v>

908
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:11.424
<v Speaker 3>the traditional parties were swept aside</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I kind of joke party the five star </v>

909
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:18.060
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was founded by a comedian and,</v>

910
00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:19.180
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

911
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.090
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

912
00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.550
<v Speaker 3>an authoritarian populist party of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left is now in league with,</v>

913
00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.483
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of neo fascist party and we are </v>

914
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:26.514
<v Speaker 3>seeing the breakdown of the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties of the center driven by slow </v>

915
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 3>growth and ethnic competition.</v>

916
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:32.843
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying was it gonna </v>

917
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.230
<v Speaker 3>happen no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if trump had lost this election,</v>

918
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:38.310
<v Speaker 3>trump never rode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So nothing is going to happen,</v>

919
00:45:38.311 --> 00:45:40.890
<v Speaker 3>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People make choices.</v>

920
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.053
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

921
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.710
<v Speaker 3>at the darkest moments in American </v>
<v Speaker 3>history in 1930 to 18,</v>

922
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:47.990
<v Speaker 3>60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

923
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.373
<v Speaker 3>political parties and political </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements converged on programs that </v>

924
00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:52.554
<v Speaker 3>were constitutional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were liberal in the broadest sense </v>

925
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:55.524
<v Speaker 3>of the term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they found leaders who wanted to </v>

926
00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:02.250
<v Speaker 3>uphold the American tradition and change</v>
<v Speaker 3>it enough that it could continue,</v>

927
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:03.263
<v Speaker 3>but without violating its assets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This time it's as if huey long had </v>

928
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 3>become president 1932,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Franklin Delanor Roosevelt.</v>

929
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let,</v>

930
00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.793
<v Speaker 3>let's just do like a couple minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia so that we can get to that </v>

931
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:17.160
<v Speaker 3>because we can't talk about trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>without talking about Russia.</v>

932
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.013
<v Speaker 3>You tweet a lot about Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you write about Russia like </v>

933
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:20.454
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about.</v>

934
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Do you absolutely believe that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself orchestrated or coordinated some</v>

935
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 3>of this stuff with the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>government?</v>

936
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.420
<v Speaker 3>There remain many secrets in the Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>story or there's no mystery,</v>

937
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:39.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact modalities of how the exchange</v>

938
00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:43.370
<v Speaker 3>happened that remain uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here,</v>

939
00:46:43.371 --> 00:46:44.204
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here is what I think I do know and I </v>

940
00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:47.730
<v Speaker 3>think what unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

941
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.073
<v Speaker 3>we know that Russia wanted Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be president and even more badly </v>

942
00:46:51.691 --> 00:46:53.550
<v Speaker 3>wanted Hillary Clinton not to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>precedent.</v>

943
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that they intervened in an,</v>

944
00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.390
<v Speaker 3>in a massive way and an industrial scale</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're learning more and more all the</v>

945
00:47:00.391 --> 00:47:01.224
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big was to hurt Hillary Clinton </v>

946
00:47:02.201 --> 00:47:03.034
<v Speaker 3>first in the Democratic primaries to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help Donald Trump first in the </v>

947
00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:06.574
<v Speaker 3>republican primaries and then in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>general election to help trump it </v>

948
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Clinton's expenses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you give me just for people that are</v>

949
00:47:11.251 --> 00:47:13.350
<v Speaker 3>playing total category?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are the examples of that?</v>

950
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me.</v>

951
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Here's the most dramatic example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

952
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wiki leaks tropes are dumped in ways</v>

953
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:26.480
<v Speaker 3>exactly timed to help Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trump people were expecting the last</v>

954
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 3>wiki leaks stump of the election in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first week of October.</v>

955
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:31.264
<v Speaker 3>They knew it was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They expected to Donna about October </v>

956
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 3>fourth or fifth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't come that day.</v>

957
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was dumped on October seventh,</v>

958
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:38.883
<v Speaker 3>within an hour of the access Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 3>tape being broken by David Fahrenthold </v>

959
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:43.040
<v Speaker 3>of the Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

960
00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.190
<v Speaker 3>the Russians or whoever controls wiki </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaks,</v>

961
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:47.980
<v Speaker 3>which I believe is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in Mike Pompeo.</v>

962
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 3>The head of the CIA believes is weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Links is a cut out for the Russians have</v>

963
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:53.614
<v Speaker 3>not directly controlled by them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They time their last Wiki leaks dump to </v>

964
00:47:57.311 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 3>help Donald Trump should he have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis in the election.</v>

965
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.860
<v Speaker 3>And it did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

966
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.570
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

967
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.271
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the book,</v>

968
00:48:04.271 --> 00:48:07.160
<v Speaker 3>I sort of gave the minute by minute tick</v>
<v Speaker 3>tock where you see it seats,</v>

969
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

970
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:09.130
<v Speaker 3>the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that help</v>

971
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.720
<v Speaker 1>God is the real question of whether the </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign itself was coordinating that or</v>

972
00:48:14.721 --> 00:48:16.560
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do all sorts of things with other,</v>

973
00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:19.040
<v Speaker 1>with foreign governments and elections </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all kinds of stuff.</v>

974
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:19.903
<v Speaker 1>So whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the campaign actually was </v>

975
00:48:21.291 --> 00:48:23.120
<v Speaker 1>coordinating it with a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

976
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.910
<v Speaker 1>which obviously we've done illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that Donald,</v>

977
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.940
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to them just doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to work out for trump</v>

978
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.760
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Hakone Americans.</v>

979
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Email is a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big crime.</v>

980
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.233
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know that a crime has been </v>

981
00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:39.370
<v Speaker 3>committed against Americans by you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by a foreign government,</v>

982
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 3>you would be annoyed about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you aspire to be present.</v>

983
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:45.910
<v Speaker 3>United States the idea that Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we don't know to what degree yet.</v>

984
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.250
<v Speaker 3>We don't know to what degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>

985
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:49.084
<v Speaker 3>people on his campaign work in regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth communication with the </v>

986
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:52.654
<v Speaker 3>Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he stood on a stage and in June of </v>

987
00:48:55.691 --> 00:49:00.670
<v Speaker 3>2016 and welcomed the Russians breaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>American law to steal his opponents.</v>

988
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:01.533
<v Speaker 3>Email to his advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His son took a meeting with people who </v>

989
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:07.990
<v Speaker 3>are offering him Russian hacked </v>
<v Speaker 3>information on Hillary Clinton.</v>

990
00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.930
<v Speaker 3>They didn't do at the meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russians didn't deliver,</v>

991
00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know it</v>

992
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:14.803
<v Speaker 1>well when we say the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to clarify between the </v>

993
00:49:16.341 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 1>government and just other actors because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone says the Russians as it,</v>

994
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.480
<v Speaker 3>the lawyer one monolithic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the true,</v>

995
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.433
<v Speaker 3>the lawyer who was at the meeting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody with intense Kremlin </v>

996
00:49:25.241 --> 00:49:26.074
<v Speaker 3>connections and who advertise that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>had criminal connections that she said </v>

997
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:30.083
<v Speaker 3>in the famous email to don Jr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russian government wants to elect </v>

998
00:49:32.621 --> 00:49:33.454
<v Speaker 3>your father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have information from the Russian </v>

999
00:49:34.961 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could help your campaign.</v>

1000
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:37.510
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

1001
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:39.220
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially in the summer.</v>

1002
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:41.103
<v Speaker 3>I am telling you that if an emissary </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the Russian government had </v>

1003
00:49:44.711 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 3>approached George W dot Bush in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>election of 2000 and said,</v>

1004
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.840
<v Speaker 3>I have information on Al Gore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll help you.</v>

1005
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:51.813
<v Speaker 3>There wouldn't have been a meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would know a phone call to the FBI </v>

1006
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:54.603
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there might even have been a phone </v>

1007
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 3>call to the Gore campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys should know about this.</v>

1008
00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:58.840
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1009
00:49:58.841 --> 00:49:59.674
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1010
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.293
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you believe that without question </v>

1011
00:50:02.341 --> 00:50:03.180
<v Speaker 1>there was coordinate?</v>

1012
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.233
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1013
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.253
<v Speaker 3>I believe the Russians helped and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that Donald Trump is not a </v>

1014
00:50:08.711 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 3>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on video.</v>

1015
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:10.890
<v Speaker 3>You can look it up now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump,</v>

1016
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.800
<v Speaker 3>welcome to help and was ready to accept </v>
<v Speaker 3>the help,</v>

1017
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.533
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a profit it from the help and that </v>

1018
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.433
<v Speaker 3>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I believe it made a difference in </v>

1019
00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:22.654
<v Speaker 3>the election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe also that there were Russian </v>

1020
00:50:24.341 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 3>attempts as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not successful to interfere with</v>

1021
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:30.710
<v Speaker 3>the actual mechanics of voting in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of states.</v>

1022
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I don't know.</v>

1023
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:33.583
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether information regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>information flowed back from the United </v>

1024
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.890
<v Speaker 3>States to Russia after don junior is </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting.</v>

1025
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:40.933
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether the Russian </v>

1026
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.273
<v Speaker 3>operation to influence the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>election benefited from any kind of </v>

1027
00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 3>information provided by American </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterparts.</v>

1028
00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:48.974
<v Speaker 3>Those are things we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I do know is that Donald Trump did </v>

1029
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:53.204
<v Speaker 3>not act patriotically and he did not act</v>
<v Speaker 3>with respect to the American political </v>

1030
00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:57.410
<v Speaker 3>system and I will never get past that.</v>

1031
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the Democrats have any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same dirt on their hands?</v>

1032
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:03.890
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

1033
00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1034
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not been bad.</v>

1035
00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1036
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.710
<v Speaker 3>they did many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1037
00:51:08.711 --> 00:51:09.950
<v Speaker 3>they did many things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1038
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.290
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Hillary Clinton found,</v>

1039
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:13.263
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a South American beauty queen who </v>

1040
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:19.730
<v Speaker 3>is offended by Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I,</v>

1041
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.833
<v Speaker 3>is it possible the Clinton campaign paid</v>
<v Speaker 3>her money for her story as that's </v>

1042
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.020
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a difference between there.</v>

1043
00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:28.203
<v Speaker 3>I really do that there's a bright line </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between the usual operations </v>

1044
00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:36.650
<v Speaker 3>of American politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be pretty rough and accepting,</v>

1045
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:37.484
<v Speaker 3>help from the client,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the clandestine service of a foreign </v>

1046
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:41.680
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wayne,</v>

1047
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.370
<v Speaker 3>give you another example to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

1048
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:44.643
<v Speaker 3>So in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was no secret that gearhard </v>

1049
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Schroeder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany and Jacques Chirac,</v>

1050
00:51:49.221 --> 00:51:50.054
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>France would dearly love to see John </v>

1051
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Kerry beat George W dot Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made that very clear.</v>

1052
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.820
<v Speaker 3>They gave interviews.</v>

1053
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are very clear,</v>

1054
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.983
<v Speaker 3>they are just counting the minutes until</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush was gone and it was also clear in </v>

1055
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:08.231
<v Speaker 3>2012 that Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferred a net romney to Obama.</v>

1056
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Either your allies have opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1057
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.940
<v Speaker 3>None of those elections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did we have hostile foreign states?</v>

1058
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

1059
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actors like that,</v>

1060
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.100
<v Speaker 3>working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not through talking to journalists,</v>

1061
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:26.510
<v Speaker 3>but through clandestine intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>services to help one candidate and heard</v>

1062
00:52:26.511 --> 00:52:31.511
<v Speaker 3>another and have it all be visible and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the candidate who was helped except</v>

1063
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:37.120
<v Speaker 3>the help and imagine if if ran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tried to intervene in 2012 against or</v>

1064
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:41.600
<v Speaker 3>for Obama or Romney and one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>candidates had said,</v>

1065
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:42.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ryan,</v>

1066
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.200
<v Speaker 3>if you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you for the help.</v>

1067
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Inconceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what trump did.</v>

1068
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.950
<v Speaker 3>He did it on video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a mystery so.</v>

1069
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.823
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to really talk about the </v>

1070
00:52:53.901 --> 00:52:55.550
<v Speaker 3>presidency and sort of the decisions in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1071
00:52:55.551 --> 00:52:58.760
<v Speaker 3>but to sort of get us to some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ending with this.</v>

1072
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.770
<v Speaker 3>If this all unfurls way I think you </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspect it will unfurl.</v>

1073
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean I definitely would be for been </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved.</v>

1074
00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:08.913
<v Speaker 3>This is where it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's start with the part that I'm </v>

1075
00:53:10.611 --> 00:53:11.444
<v Speaker 3>struggling with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is if we take all of the people </v>

1076
00:53:12.531 --> 00:53:13.364
<v Speaker 3>that talk about all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me what we're talking about </v>

1077
00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:15.531
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1078
00:53:15.531 --> 00:53:16.364
<v Speaker 3>well you impeach trump and then really </v>
<v Speaker 3>then we have to do something which is </v>

1079
00:53:18.861 --> 00:53:19.694
<v Speaker 3>unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is most likely pence knew </v>

1080
00:53:21.711 --> 00:53:23.990
<v Speaker 3>something and now you have to take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole administration out.</v>

1081
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.033
<v Speaker 3>Now we suddenly have Paul Ryan as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president or we have a Redo of the </v>

1082
00:53:27.931 --> 00:53:30.490
<v Speaker 3>election and then we're really at war </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Russia.</v>

1083
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 3>How trump has already changed this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So no pre heat.</v>

1084
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:35.603
<v Speaker 3>The Russia part of this is just one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that have happened in no </v>

1085
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.890
<v Speaker 3>presidents is Lyndon Johnson has </v>
<v Speaker 3>operated a business while president.</v>

1086
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:45.703
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No president in my memory has directed </v>

1087
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:49.824
<v Speaker 3>his party's funds into his own personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About 80 percent of the money that the </v>

1088
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.013
<v Speaker 3>Republican Party and spend on events I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>in last year was paid at a Donald Trump </v>

1089
00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:59.334
<v Speaker 3>branded resort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like when they're holding </v>

1090
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:05.870
<v Speaker 3>meetings at more or with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine sent me this clip,</v>

1091
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:07.104
<v Speaker 3>George Schultz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was secretary of state under Ronald </v>

1092
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:09.223
<v Speaker 3>Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been an important executive maybe </v>

1093
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.390
<v Speaker 3>ceo at Bechtel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the giant engineering firm,</v>

1094
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 3>and that his confirmation hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was asked Mr Schultz after you become</v>

1095
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:17.484
<v Speaker 3>secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would your relationship be with </v>

1096
00:54:18.661 --> 00:54:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Bechtel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1097
00:54:20.071 --> 00:54:21.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only one possible answer.</v>

1098
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1099
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:25.660
<v Speaker 3>That was the standard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1100
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:31.250
<v Speaker 3>so when you have is an attack on every </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical norm of the US government,</v>

1101
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:33.083
<v Speaker 3>both financial and national security and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sea and half the country is being </v>

1102
00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:39.300
<v Speaker 3>born along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the discussions we're having,</v>

1103
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:44.780
<v Speaker 3>our discussions that I prompt in nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 2013 as recently as that.</v>

1104
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.033
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someday we'll be having these </v>

1105
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:48.000
<v Speaker 3>discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People think,</v>

1106
00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:48.834
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will be so far gone even to </v>

1107
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 3>contemplate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is an unprocessable.</v>

1108
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.193
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we heading toward an impeachment </v>

1109
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:56.063
<v Speaker 3>crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what were the crisis we're </v>

1110
00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.550
<v Speaker 3>heading toward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's what I really,</v>

1111
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.340
<v Speaker 3>one of my deepest worries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>

1112
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:05.603
<v Speaker 3>there's a good chance we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrive at this place that Mueller is </v>

1113
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:08.124
<v Speaker 3>going to report if he's assuming he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not fired and he's going to discover a </v>

1114
00:55:10.651 --> 00:55:11.484
<v Speaker 3>lot of things that are violations of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>law done by mid level and even upper </v>

1115
00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:15.714
<v Speaker 3>level people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he may discover some financial </v>

1116
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:19.464
<v Speaker 3>malpractices or a lot of laws about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like declaring you're a foreign </v>

1117
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:22.883
<v Speaker 3>agent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are technical rules about </v>

1118
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.580
<v Speaker 3>campaign finance and he will discover or</v>
<v Speaker 3>may infractions of those.</v>

1119
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.103
<v Speaker 3>But the core thing and the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter that people like near concerned </v>

1120
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:35.790
<v Speaker 3>about is probably not illegal.</v>

1121
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:37.043
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not illegal for an </v>
<v Speaker 3>American politician to work with a </v>

1122
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:40.321
<v Speaker 3>hostile foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1123
00:55:40.321 --> 00:55:41.154
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't such a law and it's hard to </v>

1124
00:55:41.791 --> 00:55:46.791
<v Speaker 3>imagine what such law would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so where we may be a year and a half</v>

1125
00:55:46.891 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 3>from now is confronting this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump worked in some way.</v>

1126
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:53.010
<v Speaker 3>We may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not predicting this,</v>

1127
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:53.844
<v Speaker 3>I'm just hypothesizing worked in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>way with a hostile foreign intelligence </v>

1128
00:55:56.731 --> 00:55:57.564
<v Speaker 3>service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he himself broken a law and doing </v>

1129
00:55:59.641 --> 00:56:02.040
<v Speaker 3>that and now the country's going to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to process,</v>

1130
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:03.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to deal with that.</v>

1131
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.823
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to be part of what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in this new era which is </v>

1132
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.090
<v Speaker 3>ripping apart the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1133
00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.053
<v Speaker 3>the cords that bind us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things that makes a </v>

1134
00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:17.130
<v Speaker 3>country is the assumption how your </v>
<v Speaker 3>connections to your fellow Americans,</v>

1135
00:56:17.131 --> 00:56:18.480
<v Speaker 3>however much you may disagree with them.</v>

1136
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:19.763
<v Speaker 3>And however you may have a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>color skin or have a different accent </v>

1137
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:23.124
<v Speaker 3>from you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bond is more powerful than the </v>

1138
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:26.764
<v Speaker 3>bonds outside the border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as American politics becomes </v>

1139
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.670
<v Speaker 3>emphasized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people were saying,</v>

1140
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.133
<v Speaker 3>my connections with this global movement</v>
<v Speaker 3>of reactionary populace forces are more </v>

1141
00:56:40.961 --> 00:56:41.794
<v Speaker 3>powerful than my bonds to fellow </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans have different skin and </v>

1142
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:48.100
<v Speaker 3>different accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

1143
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.420
<v Speaker 3>unless you could show me that Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump literally broke a federal criminal</v>

1144
00:56:52.421 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 3>statute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind what he did.</v>

1145
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:58.023
<v Speaker 3>So how do we get out of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we get out of either that </v>

1146
00:56:59.981 --> 00:57:00.814
<v Speaker 3>inevitability or do doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just ended up literally fighting on the </v>

1147
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.193
<v Speaker 3>street?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way we get out of it is we have to </v>

1148
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 3>venue American nationhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1149
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.200
<v Speaker 3>and so we have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we get out of this,</v>

1150
00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:18.213
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some are going to sound pretty liberal </v>

1151
00:57:19.181 --> 00:57:20.440
<v Speaker 3>and some are going to sound pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>

1152
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I believe we need a lot less immigration</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's,</v>

1153
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.650
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to make a nation.</v>

1154
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've taken on a lot of new people.</v>

1155
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1156
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a naturalized citizen myself.</v>

1157
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:34.240
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in Canada and my family is </v>
<v Speaker 3>from eastern Europe.</v>

1158
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 3>Making nations is hard and time </v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming.</v>

1159
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:38.913
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the conservative part of the </v>

1160
00:57:40.181 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 3>part you need to say that sounds pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>trumpy it actually,</v>

1161
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:44.203
<v Speaker 3>you'll have the whole left and at </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually every Democrat against you </v>

1162
00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:49.210
<v Speaker 3>that you need a thicker social insurance</v>
<v Speaker 3>network.</v>

1163
00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need,</v>

1164
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:53.950
<v Speaker 3>you need a real healthcare system </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what we have to deal with,</v>

1165
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:55.143
<v Speaker 3>we have to deal with the crisis in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expect we have to care for each other </v>

1166
00:57:57.821 --> 00:57:58.700
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1167
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:03.310
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we went through in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole second Obama term,</v>

1168
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:07.690
<v Speaker 3>people who didn't graduate from college </v>
<v Speaker 3>living less long than their parents,</v>

1169
00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.030
<v Speaker 3>which literally did not happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Depression.</v>

1170
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.900
<v Speaker 3>And not only did nobody do anything but </v>
<v Speaker 3>no one even noticed.</v>

1171
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:17.200
<v Speaker 3>This was founded by pair of economists </v>
<v Speaker 3>who happened to look at some data.</v>

1172
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:19.270
<v Speaker 3>There's no one was paying a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to this.</v>

1173
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:20.403
<v Speaker 3>The opioid epidemic erupted with no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Washington paying much attention to </v>

1174
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:25.390
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1175
00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:26.860
<v Speaker 3>we need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1176
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.693
<v Speaker 3>we're going to need to build a stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stronger sense of national identity </v>

1177
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be a different kind of</v>

1178
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 3>national identity is not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Palin's America,</v>

1179
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:38.403
<v Speaker 3>but we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to find some way of </v>

1180
00:58:39.131 --> 00:58:40.830
<v Speaker 3>agreeing what it means to be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>American,</v>

1181
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:43.320
<v Speaker 3>what it means not to be an American or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1182
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:46.480
<v Speaker 3>the inherent problem there that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught now between trump and sort of the</v>

1183
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:47.314
<v Speaker 3>democrats that love identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And neither one of those is giving us </v>

1184
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:51.010
<v Speaker 3>the answer to that.</v>

1185
00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:52.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is the voice?</v>

1186
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:53.014
<v Speaker 3>That's where is the political voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's saying exactly what you just </v>

1187
00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:55.601
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1188
00:58:55.601 --> 00:58:58.090
<v Speaker 3>we've been here before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1189
00:58:58.570 --> 00:58:59.403
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that melting pot story that you were </v>

1190
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:05.611
<v Speaker 3>told it wasn't true at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a myth we created later.</v>

1191
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the United States entered World War</v>

1192
00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:10.653
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest minority in the country was </v>

1193
00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:14.590
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest with German speaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans.</v>

1194
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:15.873
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was real doubt about what the </v>

1195
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.153
<v Speaker 3>United States would be able to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany in the first world war because </v>

1196
00:59:19.421 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 3>the German Americans might be disloyal </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the country went on a ramp,</v>

1197
00:59:22.551 --> 00:59:24.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean a band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>German language,</v>

1198
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:26.540
<v Speaker 3>newspapers that suppressed German </v>
<v Speaker 3>language schools.</v>

1199
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:31.750
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't a melting pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a harsh and rancorous process.</v>

1200
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:37.040
<v Speaker 3>And the United States had in the 19th in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the immediate aftermath of world war,</v>

1201
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:37.874
<v Speaker 3>one of pogroms in American cities that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were very against by white Americans </v>

1202
00:59:42.171 --> 00:59:46.880
<v Speaker 3>against blocks that were deadlier than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the antisemitic programs that took place</v>

1203
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:47.743
<v Speaker 3>under the czar.</v>

1204
00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1205
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 3>those were facts of our history and </v>
<v Speaker 3>other that we built.</v>

1206
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:54.063
<v Speaker 3>But I'm in the years after World War Two</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for half a century after a strong </v>

1207
00:59:58.791 --> 00:59:59.624
<v Speaker 3>sense of national identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to do that state building and </v>

1208
01:00:01.911 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 3>nation building process again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of it's going to not look.</v>

1209
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.600
<v Speaker 3>I is going to look out partly liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly conservative.</v>

1210
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.593
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be a new politics for </v>

1211
01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:13.590
<v Speaker 3>a new century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that people are going that.</v>

1212
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:16.310
<v Speaker 3>And if anyone is standing around saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1213
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:20.780
<v Speaker 3>I think I prefer the problems of 1982 so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can have the solutions of 1982.</v>

1214
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:22.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just not helping.</v>

1215
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>What would you say to the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>

1216
01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and this is a little bit more where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall in all of this,</v>

1217
01:00:27.931 --> 01:00:28.764
<v Speaker 1>that the government is just not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to any of these things that I </v>

1218
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>hear you on all of these problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>without question,</v>

1219
01:00:34.171 --> 01:00:35.830
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1220
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>but that to me at this point that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you're talking about,</v>

1221
01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>he's showing me the government no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>functions this,</v>

1222
01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:42.953
<v Speaker 1>the federal government specifically no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer functions in a way that it can </v>

1223
01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:46.524
<v Speaker 1>cope or deal with any of these things we</v>
<v Speaker 1>get then bad actors that want to wreck </v>

1224
01:00:49.681 --> 01:00:50.514
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we get these mid level management </v>

1225
01:00:52.141 --> 01:00:52.974
<v Speaker 1>people that never really do anything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could look at virtually every </v>

1226
01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>member of Congress that all the answers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're asking for,</v>

1227
01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I would argue have almost nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the government.</v>

1228
01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:03.563
<v Speaker 1>And that there's other ways now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because of the Internet and </v>

1229
01:01:05.701 --> 01:01:06.534
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other ways that we can connect </v>

1230
01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and build things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

1231
01:01:10.201 --> 01:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Elon musk is the guy that's getting us </v>
<v Speaker 1>into space.</v>

1232
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Warren Buffet's working on an alternate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1233
01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>healthcare plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1234
01:01:17.071 --> 01:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>like that there's just other ways to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and that,</v>

1235
01:01:19.651 --> 01:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>those machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't work anymore.</v>

1236
01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:23.483
<v Speaker 1>Looks something.</v>

1237
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.473
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the great social </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformations have in the American </v>

1238
01:01:27.241 --> 01:01:28.074
<v Speaker 3>history is different from that of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries in this way that oftentimes </v>

1239
01:01:31.681 --> 01:01:35.250
<v Speaker 3>the way the country is addressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most effective cultural change in my</v>

1240
01:01:35.251 --> 01:01:37.830
<v Speaker 3>lifetime was prompt with mothers against</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk driving.</v>

1241
01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that changed Americans' attitudes.</v>

1242
01:01:40.951 --> 01:01:42.340
<v Speaker 3>They changed laws to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1243
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.800
<v Speaker 3>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state has a role.</v>

1244
01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1245
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:45.503
<v Speaker 3>I think for things like the gun debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that I think that is going to be </v>

1246
01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:49.404
<v Speaker 3>ultimately addressed if it is addressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>not by state action brought by private </v>

1247
01:01:51.901 --> 01:01:53.580
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is whatever the laws are.</v>

1248
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.533
<v Speaker 3>Just if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have kids and you care about </v>

1249
01:01:55.381 --> 01:01:56.640
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a gun in the house,</v>

1250
01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.880
<v Speaker 3>you know that justice mothers against </v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk driving change.</v>

1251
01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:02.760
<v Speaker 3>The idea that it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk driving was funny too.</v>

1252
01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:03.594
<v Speaker 3>The idea that it was not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have to change the idea that if </v>

1253
01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:07.980
<v Speaker 3>you're a responsible parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your arm to,</v>

1254
01:02:07.981 --> 01:02:08.814
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new better understanding that if </v>

1255
01:02:10.951 --> 01:02:14.230
<v Speaker 3>you're armed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not a responsible parent a,</v>

1256
01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:15.730
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1257
01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>the Conservatives won't be happy here </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say.</v>

1258
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1259
01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>A lot won't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1260
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.300
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just happens to be.</v>

1261
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:22.543
<v Speaker 3>What's the saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The facts don't care about your </v>

1262
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:26.760
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fact.</v>

1263
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

1264
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I think ben would argue with that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we can do that,</v>

1265
01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:33.520
<v Speaker 1>but we will be sensitive feelings.</v>

1266
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.913
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1267
01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.733
<v Speaker 3>but then of course you had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government has to do this and it's true </v>

1268
01:02:40.961 --> 01:02:42.640
<v Speaker 3>that dollar for dollar and pound for </v>
<v Speaker 3>pound,</v>

1269
01:02:42.641 --> 01:02:45.700
<v Speaker 3>the American government has always been </v>
<v Speaker 3>less effective than other governments.</v>

1270
01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:46.893
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes it's more effective and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's less effective or things </v>

1271
01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.940
<v Speaker 3>that the government is going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1272
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:52.883
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the government doesn't have to </v>

1273
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:56.500
<v Speaker 3>administer the healthcare system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would hope it wouldn't.</v>

1274
01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a role for the profit motive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>for competition.</v>

1275
01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:00.723
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that we're going to accept </v>
<v Speaker 3>a country in which large numbers of </v>

1276
01:03:04.721 --> 01:03:08.800
<v Speaker 3>Americans are uncovered are outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare system and um,</v>

1277
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:11.950
<v Speaker 3>that people literally die because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

1278
01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:12.843
<v Speaker 3>they can't afford dental care and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>teeth fester and fester and gets into </v>

1279
01:03:15.251 --> 01:03:18.490
<v Speaker 3>their body and it kills them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That has to change.</v>

1280
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.580
<v Speaker 3>And that the role of the state is part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1281
01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.713
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to have a new ethic of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationhood without higher border and </v>

1282
01:03:26.081 --> 01:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>more mutual care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1283
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:29.103
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course governments going to be part </v>

1284
01:03:29.531 --> 01:03:30.580
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

1285
01:03:30.581 --> 01:03:32.800
<v Speaker 3>not that that only the federal </v>
<v Speaker 3>government because a lot of the.</v>

1286
01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:33.634
<v Speaker 3>I mean the country is big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a running California is </v>

1287
01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:36.853
<v Speaker 3>challenged enough.</v>

1288
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:42.020
<v Speaker 1>So since you don't say you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative specifically anymore,</v>

1289
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if people are listening and going,</v>

1290
01:03:44.671 --> 01:03:45.504
<v Speaker 1>I get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit of both because </v>

1291
01:03:46.321 --> 01:03:47.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of big government here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1292
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.713
<v Speaker 1>I know you're saying you would prefer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government not have to do health </v>

1293
01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:51.331
<v Speaker 1>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

1294
01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1295
01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of all over the place right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1296
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:53.904
<v Speaker 1>Which I think a lot of people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the situation we're in </v>

1297
01:03:56.551 --> 01:03:57.960
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1298
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>what do you call that now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that.</v>

1299
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.193
<v Speaker 1>And I only ask about labels because </v>
<v Speaker 1>although they're becoming increasingly </v>

1300
01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:05.640
<v Speaker 1>meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it helps people go,</v>

1301
01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:07.140
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my starting point.</v>

1302
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1303
01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.793
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a label for it because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think this is one of those moments in </v>

1304
01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:14.580
<v Speaker 3>American history where you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something new.</v>

1305
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1306
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:18.810
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for 25 years after the civil war,</v>

1307
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.823
<v Speaker 3>Americans kept arguing both about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war and about its financial </v>

1308
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.124
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they began to notice that in </v>

1309
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:26.364
<v Speaker 3>the aftermath that they had these big </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities grow up that were intensely </v>

1310
01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:29.544
<v Speaker 3>corruptly governed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a new new movements came along </v>

1311
01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.300
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1312
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:36.443
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the legacy of the civil </v>

1313
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:41.970
<v Speaker 3>wars is resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still not fully resolved.</v>

1314
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:45.030
<v Speaker 3>But in the meantime we have to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we get streetcars in New York?</v>

1315
01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:46.810
<v Speaker 3>How do we get the water clean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1316
01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.753
<v Speaker 3>how do we make sure that the older men </v>
<v Speaker 3>are and aren't taking bribes and that </v>

1317
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:52.860
<v Speaker 3>new political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at first they weren't,</v>

1318
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.820
<v Speaker 3>they just knew what the problems were </v>
<v Speaker 3>and as they worked on the problems,</v>

1319
01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 3>they develop labels to describe what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were doing.</v>

1320
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 3>But first you start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the ways that,</v>

1321
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially on the right,</v>

1322
01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.300
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways that we go wrong,</v>

1323
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:07.403
<v Speaker 3>it's a new problem is presented to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and instead of looking at the problem </v>

1324
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:12.350
<v Speaker 3>studying it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we reach for volume of the Talmud and we</v>

1325
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.193
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did rabbi I'm Russell Kirk say </v>

1326
01:05:15.691 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>about this three quarters of a century </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago?</v>

1327
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he never talked about it,</v>

1328
01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 3>therefore we can't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel good about this.</v>

1329
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.873
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like you've presented it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple of interesting ideas that I </v>

1330
01:05:25.651 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 3>haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I haven't quite talked about here.</v>

1331
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 3>And you're coming at it from different </v>
<v Speaker 3>angles.</v>

1332
01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Is there anyone that's doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically?</v>

1333
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:32.014
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are the people that you right now </v>

1334
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:34.210
<v Speaker 3>think are making?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing it right now.</v>

1335
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.170
<v Speaker 3>You and I and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

1336
01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:39.603
<v Speaker 3>look there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of things that come out </v>

1337
01:05:40.331 --> 01:05:42.310
<v Speaker 3>of the trump era that are actually good.</v>

1338
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.500
<v Speaker 3>They're prefers gifts that he's given </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1339
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.693
<v Speaker 3>One of them is by lying all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's helped us understand how important </v>

1340
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:49.384
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people tell the truth when you know </v>

1341
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.680
<v Speaker 3>you're concerned about what goes on on </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus.</v>

1342
01:05:53.681 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 3>You know the phrase post-truth began as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a compliment,</v>

1343
01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.150
<v Speaker 3>not a criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It began by,</v>

1344
01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.193
<v Speaker 3>by people who wanted to overthrow </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian truth structures and open </v>

1345
01:06:02.121 --> 01:06:02.954
<v Speaker 3>the way to many multiple truths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they discovered that when you do </v>

1346
01:06:05.441 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 3>that in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get the opposite of truth,</v>

1347
01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 3>isn't truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opposite of truth is lying.</v>

1348
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.340
<v Speaker 3>We've seen rising levels of civic </v>
<v Speaker 3>engagement and we,</v>

1349
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I think we are seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially among the young,</v>

1350
01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.550
<v Speaker 3>a sense that the political categories </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've inherited are obsolete.</v>

1351
01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have to start looking at </v>

1352
01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:22.920
<v Speaker 3>problems a new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1353
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:28.320
<v Speaker 3>and that they have to be begin with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems and then develop the solutions.</v>

1354
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 3>And then people will disagree with a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>party system will come from is,</v>

1355
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:34.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we really contemplate,</v>

1356
01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:37.060
<v Speaker 3>how do we improve the health outcomes of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our fellow citizens?</v>

1357
01:06:37.061 --> 01:06:37.894
<v Speaker 3>How do we deal with drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we deal with a declining life </v>

1358
01:06:39.701 --> 01:06:41.620
<v Speaker 3>expectancy of those who don't go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>college,</v>

1359
01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:43.803
<v Speaker 3>they're going to disagree and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll find like minded groups and </v>

1360
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.220
<v Speaker 3>they'll end up inside the Republican and</v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic parties.</v>

1361
01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Those institutions will always be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The content will change.</v>

1362
01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.000
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and along the way we'll find new names,</v>

1363
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:56.703
<v Speaker 3>but anyone politically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I appreciate the compliment and </v>

1364
01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:02.290
<v Speaker 3>I think there are some people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make some sense these days,</v>

1365
01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:02.871
<v Speaker 3>but really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1366
01:07:02.871 --> 01:07:03.704
<v Speaker 3>do you think anyone politically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it will start at the state </v>

1367
01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:06.304
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1368
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the mayor here in Los Angeles as</v>

1369
01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:09.484
<v Speaker 3>an example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's trying to figure out how </v>

1370
01:07:10.601 --> 01:07:11.680
<v Speaker 3>things work.</v>

1371
01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Andrew Cuomo in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in kind of a bully,</v>

1372
01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:15.423
<v Speaker 3>but he cares about why does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does it cost three times as much or </v>

1373
01:07:18.761 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is to build a subway in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York as in London.</v>

1374
01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1375
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:23.973
<v Speaker 3>so I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the regeneration of the American </v>

1376
01:07:26.351 --> 01:07:27.184
<v Speaker 3>political system has always come from </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities and states and I think that will </v>

1377
01:07:30.731 --> 01:07:35.050
<v Speaker 3>be even more true in the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A man here in California,</v>

1378
01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:35.973
<v Speaker 3>what you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a revival of political </v>

1379
01:07:37.061 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1380
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:41.510
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I stay a </v>
<v Speaker 3>registered Republican is you.</v>

1381
01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.413
<v Speaker 3>I look at California and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens when you get a one </v>

1382
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.170
<v Speaker 3>party state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get factional politics.</v>

1383
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:50.800
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mitigate the problems of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnically driven politics.</v>

1384
01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:52.960
<v Speaker 3>It makes them worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're gonna need,</v>

1385
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:57.280
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna need two party competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to need a new solutions.</v>

1386
01:07:57.281 --> 01:07:59.230
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I try to do in my work is to</v>

1387
01:07:59.231 --> 01:08:00.720
<v Speaker 3>try to offer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1388
01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.000
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of a more useful kind of</v>

1389
01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:05.770
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because,</v>

1390
01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:06.843
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what I tried to do with </v>

1391
01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:08.184
<v Speaker 3>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even last week I had Mike </v>

1392
01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:11.480
<v Speaker 3>shellenberger on who's running as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrat,</v>

1393
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:12.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1394
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 3>he's more of an old school Democrat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's into nuclear power and all sorts</v>

1395
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.240
<v Speaker 1>of new ideas and using technology to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve our problems running against Gavin</v>

1396
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>newsome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is,</v>

1397
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 1>who's the hero of the left than he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks he's too left.</v>

1398
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:24.343
<v Speaker 1>And then this week I have you on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss your frustrations with the </v>

1399
01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

1400
01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>This is what we have to keep doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

1401
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:31.430
<v Speaker 1>that's all we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1402
01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was.</v>

1403
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:33.853
<v Speaker 1>And as long and we have to defend our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to do that and defend that both </v>

1404
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:39.884
<v Speaker 1>against those who would use violence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>against those who would use corruption </v>

1405
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>to try to shut down proper discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1406
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:47.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect ending right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for though,</v>

1407
01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect we'll do this again.</v>

1409
01:08:50.661 --> 01:08:51.494
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get ben in here and we'll do that </v>

1410
01:08:52.371 --> 01:08:53.204
<v Speaker 1>little facts over feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we get a couple of other </v>

1411
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:57.530
<v Speaker 1>people in here to to mix up some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas for more.</v>

1412
