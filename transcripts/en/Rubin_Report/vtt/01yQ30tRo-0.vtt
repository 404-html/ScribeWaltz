1
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.943
<v Speaker 1>Our last direct message before Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump is sworn in as the 45th president </v>

3
00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:11.624
<v Speaker 1>of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to half of the media and </v>

4
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.384
<v Speaker 1>countless celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>January 20th will be the beginning of </v>

5
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:17.174
<v Speaker 1>the Armageddon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to trump supporters and lots </v>

6
00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>of anime avatars on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>January 20th will be the single greatest</v>

7
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 1>day in world history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I however,</v>

8
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:26.774
<v Speaker 1>think that the truth lies somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the bloviation of Michael Moore </v>

9
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:30.704
<v Speaker 1>and the memes of pepe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The frog in the space between these two </v>

10
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:35.864
<v Speaker 1>extremes is some incredibly fertile </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground for those of us who want to make </v>

11
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>this country sane again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

12
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:42.044
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time you felt that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so much going on that was </v>

13
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>changing the world all around us all at </v>
<v Speaker 1>once?</v>

14
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.613
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're thinking back to eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago when Barack Obama ran on hope </v>

15
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:51.824
<v Speaker 1>and change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually think that there's more </v>

16
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>opportunity right now than there was.</v>

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Then we can debate whether Obama was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good president or not.</v>

18
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.863
<v Speaker 1>I'd say pretty much yes on domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy and basically no on the </v>

19
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>international front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of actual change,</v>

20
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>did much really changed or did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system just keeps chugging along.</v>

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have much of a problem with that</v>

22
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>system chugging along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For all its faults,</v>

23
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:14.984
<v Speaker 1>our system is still a pretty great one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if change was what you wanted eight </v>

24
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:19.664
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really sure that's what you got </v>

25
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.503
<v Speaker 1>with trump though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can be no doubt that change is </v>

26
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.084
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything about trump from the way he </v>

27
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:28.364
<v Speaker 1>debated his tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cabinet picks have been different </v>

28
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:31.964
<v Speaker 1>than anything before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not like any of his tactics are </v>

29
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:35.504
<v Speaker 1>his choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't argue that change isn't </v>

30
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This very second,</v>

31
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't like the change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

32
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>it is your duty as a citizen to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>your voice heard.</v>

33
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.843
<v Speaker 1>Get out their protests or volunteer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be part of the process with which you </v>

34
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>are so upset right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

35
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're happy,</v>

36
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>trump won and you think he's the answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to political correctness and the rest of</v>

37
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>society's ills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're about to be tested to.</v>

38
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.933
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to be against political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness and for free speech when </v>

39
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:05.924
<v Speaker 1>you're in the opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes real character to be </v>

40
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:09.164
<v Speaker 1>against political correctness and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech when it's your guy that the </v>

41
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:15.770
<v Speaker 1>words are aimed at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that most of you who watched the</v>

42
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:16.604
<v Speaker 1>show aren't really on either one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these teams and instead care more about </v>

43
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>principles then party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

44
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I really believe it's not just you </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this channel who believed this,</v>

45
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.403
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty much everyone out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>who isn't on the Democratic or </v>

46
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:30.584
<v Speaker 1>Republican payroll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many republicans made it clear they </v>

47
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.720
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't work with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which lead to gridlock,</v>

48
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>which led to trump.</v>

49
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.993
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many Democrats are making it clear that </v>

50
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:40.034
<v Speaker 1>they won't work with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really just makes them as bad as </v>

51
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:44.264
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans they have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about for the past eight </v>

52
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't how our system is supposed to</v>

53
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:50.354
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By constantly being held hostage by two </v>

54
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:53.444
<v Speaker 1>parties who care more about stopping the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other one from succeeding than doing </v>

55
00:02:56.841 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>anything positive in themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is clearly where we are.</v>

56
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why change,</v>

57
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>real change is needed now more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

58
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.633
<v Speaker 1>The change shouldn't be about whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>you vote for a Democrat or vote for a </v>

59
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it should be about how much power</v>

60
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>we give any of these people to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>our lives.</v>

61
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.643
<v Speaker 1>Violent protests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which unfortunately I think we're going </v>

62
00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>to have more and more of will only bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>more authoritarianism and state power.</v>

63
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>We need to change attitudes and win the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle of ideas,</v>

64
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>not just the battle of the day.</v>

65
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.753
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've spent the last year and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a half talking about having honest </v>

66
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>conversations and dealing with difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>topics.</v>

67
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Every time we forego real debate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>silence our opponents,</v>

68
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>we spawn a new set of people who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>come in with easy answers.</v>

69
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.213
<v Speaker 1>This is the space that the true bigots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and actual authoritarians will flourish </v>

70
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:49.684
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if they're far </v>

71
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:51.694
<v Speaker 1>leftists who want to silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Critics are far rightists who want to </v>

72
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>kick out immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want conversation,</v>

73
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.294
<v Speaker 1>they want control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also why I'm completely convinced </v>

74
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>that a new center is developing faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>than even we realized traditional labels</v>

75
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:06.814
<v Speaker 1>are becoming increasingly meaningless as</v>
<v Speaker 1>people realize that the battle is no </v>

76
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>longer democrat versus Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor is it us verse them.</v>

77
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>The battle lines are now those who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly for freedom versus those who would</v>

78
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>stifle it in the name of tolerance or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of security.</v>

79
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.343
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to the Internet though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rising group of voices who are </v>

80
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:26.314
<v Speaker 1>calling out this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to win some of these </v>

81
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>battles and if trump has taught us </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

82
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.320
<v Speaker 1>people like a winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Alright Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won.</v>

84
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.524
<v Speaker 1>So now it's time to do some real </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews and respond to some real </v>

85
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a chair for you right there.</v>

86
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 1>So while maybe I've lost the left or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left has lost me,</v>

87
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I now see that fertile ground that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to start planting some seeds.</v>

88
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.423
<v Speaker 1>These seeds will not only be to grow new</v>
<v Speaker 1>alliances with liberals and </v>

89
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even Marxists and progressives,</v>

90
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I have no desire to silence them or any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people I disagree with.</v>

91
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.034
<v Speaker 1>I want to continue to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas which will help us avoid that </v>

92
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>whole pesky armageddon thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned earlier.</v>

93
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.743
<v Speaker 1>We can do this together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by d platforming and through </v>

94
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:14.284
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by consistently showing that the </v>

95
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:17.314
<v Speaker 1>ideas of freedom and liberty and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights of the individual are the best </v>

96
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>way to attain a society that values true</v>
<v Speaker 1>human equality.</v>

97
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week is author radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>host and is Dennis prager.</v>

98
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.513
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks before the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at an event for his youtube </v>

99
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prager university,</v>

100
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.193
<v Speaker 1>and I heard Dennis his keynote speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard Dennis speak through his </v>

101
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>conservative Lens about how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful experiment that is America and</v>

102
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>his deep concern for the future of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

103
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>While I know we have our disagreements </v>
<v Speaker 1>about religion,</v>

104
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion,</v>

105
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:50.884
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see dentists as someone I can build a </v>

106
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>bridge with because he'll honestly tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>me what he believes and I'll do the same</v>

107
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>for every liberal that he may convert to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism.</v>

108
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.534
<v Speaker 1>I think I can convert just as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives to liberalism and as I </v>

109
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:06.704
<v Speaker 1>said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these labels are becoming more and more </v>

110
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.134
<v Speaker 1>meaningless by the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if we agree on every </v>

111
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:12.524
<v Speaker 1>little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What matters is that will defend the </v>

112
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>other person's right to liberty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

113
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.583
<v Speaker 1>As we enter this new phase of change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be up to us as to whether the </v>

114
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>change is positive or negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our system is stronger than one man,</v>

115
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.773
<v Speaker 1>but one man can change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's trade hope and change for the </v>

116
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>courage of our convictions and let the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chips fall where they may.</v>

117
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Joining me this week is an author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nationally syndicated radio host,</v>

118
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:46.690
<v Speaker 1>a columnist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the creator of Prager University,</v>

119
00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:48.850
<v Speaker 1>right here on the youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis prager.</v>

120
00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Rubin report</v>

121
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.680
<v Speaker 2>to be with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so somehow we've only met once,</v>

122
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:54.514
<v Speaker 2>although I feel that we're in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>space and that I know you sort of just </v>

123
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:02.110
<v Speaker 2>through your public self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the one time we met we were on Larry</v>

124
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.670
<v Speaker 2>King's show on my own home aura and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

125
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.543
<v Speaker 2>they bring you on as the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they brought me on as the liberal </v>

126
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.473
<v Speaker 2>and I think it was a little bit around </v>
<v Speaker 2>my kind of waking up to what was </v>

127
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:16.600
<v Speaker 2>happening with the left and we kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreed on a lot.</v>

128
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Not on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we agreed on a lot.</v>

129
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that odd that sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can agree with a liberal because you are</v>

130
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:24.731
<v Speaker 2>a conservative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

131
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree with a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't agree with a leftist.</v>

132
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.823
<v Speaker 2>I make the distinction between liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>left constantly because it needs to be </v>

133
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:37.150
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left is an enemy of liberalism and I</v>

134
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.910
<v Speaker 2>love liberalism on cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conservative.</v>

135
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.270
<v Speaker 2>But the irony is I don't know pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of any value that I changed since I</v>

136
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.410
<v Speaker 2>was a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

137
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born in New York,</v>

138
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.800
<v Speaker 2>but a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a Jew,</v>

139
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.430
<v Speaker 2>see Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's exactly,</v>

140
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of democratic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Riley's.</v>

141
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a given to me.</v>

142
00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:09.220
<v Speaker 2>You were all those three things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

143
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I always say on my birth certificate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had,</v>

144
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:13.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the days when you still had gender,</v>

145
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.100
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Male,</v>

146
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political affiliation,</v>

147
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.650
<v Speaker 2>liberal or Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was just a given.</v>

148
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.160
<v Speaker 2>But I haven't changed my values that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left has taken over the word liberal.</v>

149
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.473
<v Speaker 2>And so therefore I consider those values</v>
<v Speaker 2>inimical to everything liberalism stood </v>

150
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:33.484
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I've been </v>

151
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:35.524
<v Speaker 2>saying is that lately defending my </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal values is becoming a </v>

152
00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 2>conservative position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I suspect that's what,</v>

153
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.120
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

154
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.670
<v Speaker 2>What you felt when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did that change for you?</v>

155
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:47.110
<v Speaker 2>So we changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

156
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.900
<v Speaker 2>there were two seminal issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I was not on the left when,</v>

157
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.293
<v Speaker 2>during the Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I was in college and I knew </v>

158
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 2>communism was evil and my life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>devoted to fighting evil.</v>

159
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 2>That's what I care about more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

160
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I hate people who hurt people </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliberately.</v>

161
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I hate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want them destroyed.</v>

162
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 2>I want evil destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

163
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I have not wavered in that passion since</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school.</v>

164
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 2>That's all I really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

165
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I care about a million things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's my greatest care.</v>

166
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I want to destroy evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi-Ism,</v>

167
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 2>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamism,</v>

168
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 2>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

169
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:32.040
<v Speaker 2>and the left didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left hated Nazis,</v>

170
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't hate communists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it meant they didn't hate evil.</v>

171
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's my first realization that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't on the left.</v>

172
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.113
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still thought I was a liberal but </v>

173
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 2>not on the left.</v>

174
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.700
<v Speaker 2>And then Ronald Reagan came and in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence it all turned for me and then I</v>

175
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:50.934
<v Speaker 2>became a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was a government is not the </v>

176
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the problem.</v>

177
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was an epiphany and I thought </v>

178
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.833
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are truths that are so real that </v>

179
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:05.304
<v Speaker 2>if you have an open mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take more than five seconds </v>

180
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:08.964
<v Speaker 2>to realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that necessarily make you a </v>

181
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 2>republican or does that really just make</v>
<v Speaker 2>you a classical liberal?</v>

182
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:15.384
<v Speaker 2>And I know I always say on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to use a lot of these terms that </v>

183
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:22.701
<v Speaker 2>I think are starting to lose meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need them just to have labels.</v>

184
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

185
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:25.530
<v Speaker 2>So what made you then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

186
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 2>well now I'm a Republican because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could use that Reagan quote and say,</v>

187
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a classical liberal.</v>

188
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 2>It's individually in limited government.</v>

189
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the home for classical liberalism is</v>

190
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 2>the Republican party to the extent that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not big government people,</v>

191
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 2>which George W Bush was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

192
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.263
<v Speaker 2>but the only home between Democrats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans for limited government </v>

193
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 2>people is the Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you sense that changing now?</v>

194
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we're gonna have to talk a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit about trump here.</v>

195
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.703
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at first maybe you weren't </v>

196
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:58.660
<v Speaker 2>supporting him and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressionally were.</v>

197
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.120
<v Speaker 2>And then I think basically you supported</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

198
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:00.691
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

199
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:01.501
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

200
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

201
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.043
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud to say all the time will tell </v>

202
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 2>whether I will be proud to say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was thoroughly consistent.</v>

203
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I was opposed to him the most among all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans.</v>

204
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.553
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote piece after piece in </v>
<v Speaker 2>National Review Town Hall and other </v>

205
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:22.530
<v Speaker 2>places where my column appears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wa,</v>

206
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I was anti trump as anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wrote from my first column,</v>

207
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 2>if he wins the nomination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will vote for him.</v>

208
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:32.783
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thinking was clear in retrospect was </v>

209
00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:38.240
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

210
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept giving this analogy.</v>

211
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.323
<v Speaker 2>If you have two doors over one door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says man eating lion and over the </v>

212
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:52.041
<v Speaker 2>other it says maybe a man I will open </v>
<v Speaker 2>the maybe a man eating lion.</v>

213
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.333
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it as a big dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this really was more of a reflection </v>

214
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 2>of your feelings on hillary than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

215
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.673
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

216
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that feelings on the left,</v>

217
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.720
<v Speaker 2>defeating the left is as great a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>urgency as defeating Islam.</v>

218
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two,</v>

219
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.443
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies of Western civilization as we </v>

220
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:16.894
<v Speaker 2>know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say that I would sadness there </v>

221
00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:22.490
<v Speaker 2>were a lot of Nice people on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

222
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 2>the probably not that many Nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamicists all the grid that.</v>

223
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.543
<v Speaker 2>But there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This wouldn't be too thrilled about </v>

224
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:29.171
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

225
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 2>they would not go to Brooklyn born Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

226
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.850
<v Speaker 2>the left wouldn't be too thrilled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the seat.</v>

227
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.870
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get into a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

228
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it sincerely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

229
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 2>look at what they're doing to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

230
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 2>The university is now becoming a fishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick place literally,</v>

231
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

232
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.240
<v Speaker 2>with the old semi cuase I violent </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppression of dissenting voices.</v>

233
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it is the only place the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left runs without opposition.</v>

234
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 2>So when the left is free to do what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants,</v>

235
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.550
<v Speaker 2>just look at your local university and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see what's happening.</v>

236
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.983
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then</v>

237
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:08.190
<v Speaker 3>what's happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is in the mind?</v>

238
00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:10.770
<v Speaker 3>And I was around these people a lot for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time and I don't know that I have</v>

239
00:13:10.771 --> 00:13:13.110
<v Speaker 3>the right answer to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is happening,</v>

240
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:13.944
<v Speaker 3>where they have created this system of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what now I'm calling the oppression </v>

241
00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Olympics where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hood is the highest virtue that you</v>

242
00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:20.844
<v Speaker 3>can have and we have to place </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's victim hood below yours </v>

243
00:13:23.461 --> 00:13:25.170
<v Speaker 3>because that means you're better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and all that stuff.</v>

244
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.150
<v Speaker 3>What happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

245
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.380
<v Speaker 3>where did this come from?</v>

246
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.433
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one,</v>

247
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

248
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:31.114
<v Speaker 2>and it's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Analyzing the left has been as complex </v>

249
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 2>to me as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

250
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 2>the search for string theory is among </v>
<v Speaker 2>physicists.</v>

251
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.833
<v Speaker 2>It because it's so emotional that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't the logical consistency for one </v>

252
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:46.654
<v Speaker 2>answer to your question is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left does not divide the world </v>

253
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 2>between good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

254
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the left doesn't.</v>

255
00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 2>The left divides up between rich and </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor and strong and weak,</v>

256
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:00.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

257
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:01.471
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

258
00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 2>or victim and victimizer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get,</v>

259
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't get your strength from being </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

260
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.880
<v Speaker 2>You get your strength from being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim,</v>

261
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.940
<v Speaker 2>from being the underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason the leftist,</v>

262
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.823
<v Speaker 2>Pro Palestinian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone with a moral compass that works </v>

263
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.743
<v Speaker 2>some of the time knows that there was no</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison between Israel and the </v>

264
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:28.561
<v Speaker 2>Palestinians morally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the left routes for the Palestinians</v>

265
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 2>because not because they don't measure </v>
<v Speaker 2>by good and bad,</v>

266
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>they measure by weakened strong black </v>
<v Speaker 2>and white,</v>

267
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 2>west and non west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first world and third world,</v>

268
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.733
<v Speaker 2>but not good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big factor that's taking </v>

269
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:45.334
<v Speaker 2>place on the campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you define good and evil before </v>

270
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Speaker 2>you go the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way you do?</v>

271
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a trick issue.</v>

272
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.203
<v Speaker 2>A good is treating people decently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is having an openness to a opposing </v>

273
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:00.830
<v Speaker 2>views without suppressing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

274
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.530
<v Speaker 2>is not building concentration camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>

275
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.240
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not rocket science.</v>

276
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

277
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So last time I saw you was at a prager </v>

278
00:15:12.631 --> 00:15:13.464
<v Speaker 3>university event and you gave the </v>
<v Speaker 3>keynote speech was the keynote speech </v>

279
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.263
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was right before the election and I </v>

280
00:15:20.431 --> 00:15:24.870
<v Speaker 3>sensed that you actually do want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build some bridges with these people,</v>

281
00:15:24.871 --> 00:15:28.410
<v Speaker 3>which is probably partially why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why were sitting down that you weren't.</v>

282
00:15:28.411 --> 00:15:31.950
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think you were really clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like what's happening with the</v>

283
00:15:31.951 --> 00:15:32.784
<v Speaker 3>modern left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do sense that you're trying to </v>

284
00:15:34.081 --> 00:15:35.640
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to reach out to some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people,</v>

285
00:15:35.641 --> 00:15:37.890
<v Speaker 3>which is what you're doing with prager </v>
<v Speaker 3>u.</v>

286
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.700
<v Speaker 3>are you seeing any real attraction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>waking some of these people up?</v>

287
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.863
<v Speaker 2>All the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're waking people up because </v>

288
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.653
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not one of the 150 prager university </v>

289
00:15:48.901 --> 00:15:50.410
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all journal,</v>

290
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.760
<v Speaker 2>five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just some burly fine fingers.</v>

291
00:15:53.761 --> 00:15:58.761
<v Speaker 2>Give them not one of them yells at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

292
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.910
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here is our position,</v>

293
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.273
<v Speaker 2>here is the reason and here are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts behind it and have a wonderful </v>

294
00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:08.934
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So isn't it funny that that became not </v>

295
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.591
<v Speaker 2>the norm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

296
00:16:13.591 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>people say to me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Love Your Show because you Aka people.</v>

297
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.220
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

298
00:16:17.221 --> 00:16:19.080
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know why get that's funny.</v>

299
00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:19.914
<v Speaker 2>You should say that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcasting 33 years and the most </v>

300
00:16:24.421 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 2>common among the most common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it is the most,</v>

301
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:30.330
<v Speaker 2>or it's among the most common reactions </v>
<v Speaker 2>I get.</v>

302
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.531
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

303
00:16:31.531 --> 00:16:34.470
<v Speaker 2>what I really love about your show is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're calm.</v>

304
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:35.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never yell.</v>

305
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.223
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do yell about four times a year where </v>

306
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.040
<v Speaker 2>something will get me so angry maybe six</v>
<v Speaker 2>times a year.</v>

307
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.380
<v Speaker 2>And I always apologize because I read </v>
<v Speaker 2>readers,</v>

308
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.273
<v Speaker 2>listeners tell me we love it when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>yell because it's so rare and they </v>

309
00:16:55.501 --> 00:16:56.610
<v Speaker 2>realize you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

00:16:56.611 --> 00:16:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you can really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can prick me and I'll bleed.</v>

311
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.400
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

312
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.820
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't stand yelling.</v>

313
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:03.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well to me it's sort of like a well </v>

314
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:06.670
<v Speaker 3>placed fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't say it that often.</v>

315
00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Even just saying it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably haven't said it on air and in</v>

316
00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:10.354
<v Speaker 3>quite some time,</v>

317
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.890
<v Speaker 2>but that I brought it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

318
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.990
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you the way you,</v>

319
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

320
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.983
<v Speaker 3>rage me here that you've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you feel like you have made some </v>

321
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:17.554
<v Speaker 3>traction because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hearing from people that are </v>

322
00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:20.471
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

323
00:17:20.471 --> 00:17:21.280
<v Speaker 3>there's some.</v>

324
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.510
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is a problem veet veet.</v>

325
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

326
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.100
<v Speaker 2>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

327
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.353
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

328
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.550
<v Speaker 2>when you're not taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are indoctrinated.</v>

329
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.940
<v Speaker 2>The indoctrination of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of American kids begin so early.</v>

330
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:44.370
<v Speaker 2>You're taught now in third grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are taught in,</v>

331
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:48.040
<v Speaker 2>in many of the states about carbon </v>
<v Speaker 2>emissions.</v>

332
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.413
<v Speaker 2>They don't show them a Bjorn Lomborg </v>
<v Speaker 2>video saying that we're wasting </v>

333
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 2>trillions of dollars to lower the </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature by a fraction of a degree.</v>

334
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 2>They don't show them because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe there are other sides.</v>

335
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:08.150
<v Speaker 2>There are truth tellers and deniers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are truth tellers are anti science.</v>

336
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.140
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things was I studied leftism.</v>

337
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 2>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

338
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:13.314
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I studied communist affairs marks </v>

339
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:15.954
<v Speaker 2>leftism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that they have </v>

340
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.600
<v Speaker 2>always excelled at is one word </v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissals of their ideological enemies.</v>

341
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 2>So Stalin Trotsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trotsky the father of Bolshevism.</v>

342
00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:32.490
<v Speaker 2>He called him a fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Trotsky was a fascist.</v>

343
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 2>There was no need to debate Trotsky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You call him a fascist and then have him</v>

344
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 2>killed with an ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick that.</v>

345
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:40.764
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in a nutshell what the left six </v>

346
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:45.080
<v Speaker 2>herb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist intolerant,</v>

347
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 2>xenophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobic,</v>

348
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

349
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:47.904
<v Speaker 2>bigoted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no need to think on the left </v>

350
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.040
<v Speaker 2>because you have a one word dismissal of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your opponents.</v>

351
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

352
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.263
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so far I know that 90 percent of my </v>

353
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:56.820
<v Speaker 3>audience listening to this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

354
00:18:56.821 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this prager guy for conservative.</v>

355
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this makes sense.</v>

356
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

357
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.170
<v Speaker 3>you're hitting the keys that I hit here </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

358
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 3>So what about on something like science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>

359
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.863
<v Speaker 3>you just mentioned sight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This seems to me where the Republicans </v>

360
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 3>and the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't add up.</v>

361
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.870
<v Speaker 3>We're still debating evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're debating climate science.</v>

362
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:16.704
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've brought climate scientists in here </v>

363
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 3>who have said in unison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically they agree by the way I've had</v>

364
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Alex Epstein is books right there,</v>

365
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.793
<v Speaker 2>a moral case for fossil fuels and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to talk to him as well and he </v>

366
00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:30.320
<v Speaker 2>takes it from a different angle and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to have those</v>

367
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.050
<v Speaker 3>compensation and I don't pretend to know</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything so.</v>

368
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.133
<v Speaker 3>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But science to me is one of the things </v>

369
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 3>where the right has just</v>

370
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.183
<v Speaker 2>no gone by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those things where the </v>

371
00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 2>left has effectively demonized the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

372
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Our position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met somebody on the right who</v>

373
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 2>said the science is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not solid evolution,</v>

374
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:52.231
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

375
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:52.681
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

376
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:56.160
<v Speaker 2>so you're wanting to evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So evolution is very complex issue.</v>

377
00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

378
00:19:57.421 --> 00:19:58.254
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a particular ax to grind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I happen to believe in God and my </v>

379
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:05.010
<v Speaker 2>position for most of my life was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God created evolution.</v>

380
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I have no issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So concurrently,</v>

381
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.773
<v Speaker 2>that's not my position any longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I simply know more science and </v>

382
00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:18.450
<v Speaker 2>that if the science on evolution is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>nearly as established as people think it</v>

383
00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:20.420
<v Speaker 2>is because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

384
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:21.263
<v Speaker 2>the paleontologists themselves are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>so certain that it occurred in anywhere </v>

385
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.930
<v Speaker 2>near the way they believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two,</v>

386
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.040
<v Speaker 2>two quick things on that one is of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course I just,</v>

387
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.820
<v Speaker 2>it's just needs to be stated that </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution has zero explanation.</v>

388
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none for the creation of life.</v>

389
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.693
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no evolutionary jump between </v>

390
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.363
<v Speaker 2>inorganic and organic and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they acknowledge that they just say </v>

391
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 2>one day they'll find one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't one.</v>

392
00:20:55.030 --> 00:21:00.030
<v Speaker 2>So the evolutionist has nothing to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the origin of life.</v>

393
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:01.743
<v Speaker 2>They have something to say about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>origin of species species once life </v>

394
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 2>begins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a big difference.</v>

395
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.320
<v Speaker 2>The second part is they don't have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say even on the origin of species.</v>

396
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.553
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at there was this thing </v>

397
00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 2>called the Cambrian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it the Cambrian?</v>

398
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.270
<v Speaker 2>My wife knows she's going crazy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in the other one.</v>

399
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.340
<v Speaker 2>She's the real maven on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

400
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 2>the k onto an IFA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cambrian explosion.</v>

401
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:29.770
<v Speaker 2>That's an explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 2>This was when vast numbers of species or</v>
<v Speaker 2>rose,</v>

403
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 2>but much too quickly for evolution to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have accounted for them.</v>

404
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.250
<v Speaker 2>And there were so many qualified </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists who have taken this on.</v>

405
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

406
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 2>even the famous Harvard paleontologist </v>
<v Speaker 2>is passed away,</v>

407
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose name eludes me for the moment,</v>

408
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:51.310
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote about this.</v>

409
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 2>He was an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an atheist or agnostic,</v>

410
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:54.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said he had punctuated evolution </v>

411
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 2>where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is almost an oxymoron because it,</v>

412
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

413
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just things per day.</v>

414
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

415
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.120
<v Speaker 2>my only point is that it's not as clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they make.</v>

416
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody says to you,</v>

417
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that the world was </v>
<v Speaker 2>created in billions of years,</v>

418
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.130
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

419
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:26.190
<v Speaker 2>the world was created in six days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 hour periods,</v>

420
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:27.364
<v Speaker 2>cold days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a rejection of the science on </v>

421
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.940
<v Speaker 2>the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

422
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:31.803
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm glad you're making that function </v>

423
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:33.664
<v Speaker 2>because we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of us are evolutionary </v>

424
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.110
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can say as much as we know.</v>

425
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.591
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

426
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 2>just for the record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just today,</v>

427
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:40.894
<v Speaker 2>I had an interview with Jerry Coyne </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a world renowned and evolutionary </v>

428
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:45.124
<v Speaker 2>biologists who would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure take issue with some of the </v>

429
00:22:46.931 --> 00:22:47.764
<v Speaker 2>things you're saying here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have to bicker over those </v>

430
00:22:50.141 --> 00:22:50.974
<v Speaker 2>little things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're juggling when someone looks </v>

431
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.240
<v Speaker 2>at the literal six day thing and here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here,</v>

432
00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say forgive me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

433
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

434
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 2>let's get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a hoot if somebody believes</v>

435
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 2>God created the world in 60 slash 24 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour periods.</v>

436
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I care if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they reject vaccines,</v>

437
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.170
<v Speaker 2>if they don't give blood transfusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

438
00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:14.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what people believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care how people behave.</v>

439
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.430
<v Speaker 2>This a very important principle in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

440
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.500
<v Speaker 2>So if you happen to believe that God </v>
<v Speaker 2>created the world,</v>

441
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:25.930
<v Speaker 2>which I don't because the science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gates it.</v>

442
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 2>But if you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe that the Bible is,</v>

443
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 2>is divine and all that good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

444
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.940
<v Speaker 2>but nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

445
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.033
<v Speaker 2>if you do believe that it here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is possible to be a professor of </v>

446
00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:46.610
<v Speaker 2>medicine and believe God created the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world in six days.</v>

447
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.223
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds oxymoronic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't religious belief is </v>

448
00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 2>religious belief and scientific belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scientific belief for many people.</v>

449
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.793
<v Speaker 2>I like to reconcile them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some just say I'm not reconciling </v>

450
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what it says.</v>

451
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:06.350
<v Speaker 2>I take it and now I would like to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to my,</v>

452
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical lab police to do a research on,</v>

453
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on cancer.</v>

454
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>

455
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 2>in some way though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that reconciliation sort of splitting</v>

456
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 2>the difference of what you truly believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

457
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Dennis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

458
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in science and religion.</v>

459
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there's a conflict at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

460
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Truth is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a Hebrew saying,</v>

461
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:29.450
<v Speaker 2>the signature of God is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something is true,</v>

462
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I must believe it because it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am religiously obligated to believe it</v>

463
00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:36.490
<v Speaker 2>if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

464
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.513
<v Speaker 2>So if a doctor for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you had to have heart surgery </v>

465
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:42.330
<v Speaker 2>or something and you had two doctors to </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose from and,</v>

466
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.040
<v Speaker 2>and they had the same exact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.430
<v Speaker 2>medical background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them said,</v>

468
00:24:46.431 --> 00:24:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I believe in evolution and science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

469
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:49.881
<v Speaker 2>The other guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

470
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:50.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth was created in six days and </v>

471
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 2>guy I would flip a coin so that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have absolutely no role because they can</v>

472
00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.633
<v Speaker 2>compartmentalize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because I can not </v>

473
00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:06.830
<v Speaker 2>compartmentalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can because I know.</v>

474
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the interesting thing,</v>

475
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.130
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of orthodox Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

476
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a religious Jew but not orthodox,</v>

477
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of.</v>

478
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.070
<v Speaker 2>So I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a no ax to grind.</v>

479
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.240
<v Speaker 2>There were a lot of orthodox Jews who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doctors who are physicists,</v>

480
00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:25.070
<v Speaker 2>who are chemists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologists.</v>

481
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.233
<v Speaker 2>How was that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believed the tourists from God and </v>

482
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:33.170
<v Speaker 2>they then go to the lab and do wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific work.</v>

483
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 2>So obviously they've lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live with both.</v>

484
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that say about humans in </v>

485
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:39.404
<v Speaker 2>general?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we're just able to live with </v>

486
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Commonwealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orion?</v>

487
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.030
<v Speaker 2>I have an interesting theory on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

488
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.580
<v Speaker 2>this is why the left scares me more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

489
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

490
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.623
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leftist scared by religious </v>

491
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

492
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not scared by religious Christians </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

493
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

494
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I emphasize them.</v>

495
00:25:57.021 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got your prager u card.</v>

496
00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it said Merry Christmas.</v>

497
00:26:00.321 --> 00:26:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I freaked out and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:26:01.781 --> 00:26:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I sent the letter to the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>

499
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I know that not only we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were interviewed,</v>

500
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.040
<v Speaker 2>told us you sent them a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

501
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fear that they have is not,</v>

502
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 2>is not comparable.</v>

503
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.320
<v Speaker 2>And here is the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's my theory.</v>

504
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human being clearly needs to beliefs</v>

505
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.793
<v Speaker 2>some non rational things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that is part of what the </v>

506
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:33.941
<v Speaker 2>human mind must have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the religious person,</v>

507
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.280
<v Speaker 2>the healthy and I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

508
00:26:37.281 --> 00:26:38.114
<v Speaker 2>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy,</v>

509
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 2>nonreligious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apples and apples.</v>

510
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:45.370
<v Speaker 2>The healthy religious person confines </v>
<v Speaker 2>his non rational thought to religiosity.</v>

511
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.510
<v Speaker 2>The secular person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have the non rational,</v>

512
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.570
<v Speaker 2>they're much scarier because that is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>about splitting of cs or,</v>

513
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.790
<v Speaker 2>or Jesus walking on water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about real life.</v>

514
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 2>The amount of the non rational that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed on the left,</v>

515
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.023
<v Speaker 2>that is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically a non rational in the </v>

516
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 2>religious realm is not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary.</v>

517
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe you murder people.</v>

518
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 2>You get 72 virgins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That scary.</v>

519
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of people that believe</v>

520
00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.740
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he used Christians.</v>

521
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.143
<v Speaker 2>America was founded by fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians who produced and incredibly </v>

522
00:27:32.071 --> 00:27:34.050
<v Speaker 2>rational society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

523
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:35.150
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

524
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.050
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the competitive marketplace,</v>

525
00:27:37.051 --> 00:27:40.170
<v Speaker 2>the free market liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these were very rational ideas.</v>

526
00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 2>They were very religious men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all but many of them were.</v>

527
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

528
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:45.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

529
00:27:45.781 --> 00:27:46.614
<v Speaker 2>I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I welcome secularism in Iran and I fear </v>

530
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:53.160
<v Speaker 2>secularism in America.</v>

531
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

532
00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:55.274
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something really there between </v>

533
00:27:56.401 --> 00:27:58.370
<v Speaker 3>those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We probably have the rights society,</v>

534
00:27:58.371 --> 00:27:59.204
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

535
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting because I see this </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly and I'm sure you see it too,</v>

536
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:08.700
<v Speaker 3>this constant attacking of straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>white men have Christians.</v>

537
00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:09.534
<v Speaker 3>All of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you're saying basically is we </v>

538
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:11.754
<v Speaker 3>were born out of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America and we've become absurdly </v>

539
00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:17.130
<v Speaker 3>tolerant and yet everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not absurdly time.</v>

540
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:20.720
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's wonderfully unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uniquely right,</v>

541
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.500
<v Speaker 3>and yet we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just this idea out there that we</v>

542
00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 3>are the most intolerant place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

543
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 3>how do you fight those ideas back?</v>

544
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:30.770
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

545
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.670
<v Speaker 2>how you fight the irrational is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

546
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.670
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard because you can give </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

547
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.073
<v Speaker 2>I give evidence for America being the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least racist society that had multi </v>

548
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.170
<v Speaker 2>racial elements in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in history,</v>

549
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't convince people who have.</v>

550
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.230
<v Speaker 2>If people have a vested interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>believing something,</v>

551
00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you can't talk them out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I fear the left.</v>

552
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.050
<v Speaker 2>They have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world would collapse it.</v>

553
00:28:57.051 --> 00:29:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It is like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The famous book written when Stalin made</v>

554
00:29:00.821 --> 00:29:01.654
<v Speaker 2>this pact with Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these communists in the left who </v>

555
00:29:03.881 --> 00:29:06.340
<v Speaker 2>would followed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had followed Stalin.</v>

556
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Not all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them thought,</v>

557
00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:11.890
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been believing in nonsense my whole</v>

558
00:29:11.891 --> 00:29:13.740
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The God that failed.</v>

559
00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:14.574
<v Speaker 2>That's a very famous book from I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fifties or maybe the forties and </v>

560
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:18.731
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

561
00:29:18.731 --> 00:29:21.490
<v Speaker 2>and it was about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

562
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.383
<v Speaker 2>the left.</v>

563
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Why do people believe in communism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

564
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.430
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is drivel thing is drivel,</v>

565
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.530
<v Speaker 2>but when people drop Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions,</v>

566
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Catholicism Protestantism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evangelicalism,</v>

567
00:29:35.261 --> 00:29:36.670
<v Speaker 2>mormonism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaism,</v>

568
00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:41.910
<v Speaker 2>when people drop those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't stop yearning for certitude,</v>

569
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.730
<v Speaker 2>so what they end up with is secular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious,</v>

570
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 2>certitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are at least as scary,</v>

571
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think you would quite word it</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>

572
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:52.984
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I would wear it as they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>their letting go of the sort of easier </v>

573
00:29:56.381 --> 00:29:57.214
<v Speaker 2>answers that religion might provide and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's a little easier to sway them </v>

574
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Speaker 2>in the secular arena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you say that to say?</v>

575
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Although I don't think you would wear to</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite that.</v>

576
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.113
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fine and it's also easier for </v>

577
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:09.904
<v Speaker 2>another reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secularism makes no moral demands on </v>

578
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:13.114
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you there is no God who judges </v>

579
00:30:14.561 --> 00:30:15.394
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's also you feel great about </v>

580
00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 2>yourself by taking the right position on</v>
<v Speaker 2>any left wing issue.</v>

581
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love blacks,</v>

582
00:30:22.481 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I love gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Muslims.</v>

583
00:30:24.881 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 2>I love whoever the victim of the month </v>
<v Speaker 2>is and I'm a wonderful human being.</v>

584
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 2>My daughter is a great girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

585
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 2>The she cheat on tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

586
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.420
<v Speaker 2>but she does in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

587
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.041
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

588
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:39.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does 10 k run for breast cancer.</v>

589
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.350
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make you a daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good girl.</v>

590
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:44.690
<v Speaker 2>That's a very sweet thing that she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

591
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

592
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.710
<v Speaker 2>you are judged by your character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

593
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.510
<v Speaker 2>And there's no more character emphasis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I suspect since you live here in la,</v>

594
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:57.220
<v Speaker 2>that you're friends with probably a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of completely secular nonbelievers,</v>

595
00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who may not even,</v>

596
00:30:59.021 --> 00:31:00.350
<v Speaker 2>you might not even know they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonbelievers.</v>

597
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 2>So what's the part that I'm missing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself totally secular.</v>

598
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I try to live by some sense of morality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

599
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:10.210
<v Speaker 2>And then like everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fail at it sometimes,</v>

600
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.600
<v Speaker 2>but what's the piece that you can't stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

601
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.490
<v Speaker 2>on the good path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

602
00:31:15.491 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 2>without religion?</v>

603
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many.</v>

604
00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 2>There are many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

605
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:19.984
<v Speaker 2>why can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you know that I be glued to my </v>

606
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:24.890
<v Speaker 2>neighbor and partner and those types of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

607
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.360
<v Speaker 2>a billion times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really critical.</v>

608
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.730
<v Speaker 2>If there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no good and evil.</v>

609
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:32.620
<v Speaker 2>There are only opinions about good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

610
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

611
00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 2>they're a wonderful atheists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>agnostics,</v>

612
00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.720
<v Speaker 2>secular and there were terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious people.</v>

613
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.873
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want the long term survival </v>

614
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.410
<v Speaker 2>of a good society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cannot be done without God.</v>

615
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.573
<v Speaker 2>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>

616
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.780
<v Speaker 2>it will be an utter failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the failure in Europe,</v>

617
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Europe is a failing society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

618
00:31:55.261 --> 00:31:56.094
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it doesn't stand up for </v>

619
00:31:58.001 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stands for nothing.</v>

620
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.513
<v Speaker 2>Europe's stands for nothing except for </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling good about its own morality for </v>

621
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:05.830
<v Speaker 2>it's socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

622
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

623
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.070
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll take care of,</v>

624
00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:09.904
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of everybody with a safety net that we </v>

625
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:12.250
<v Speaker 2>can pay for.</v>

626
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.650
<v Speaker 2>So we'll bring in millions of Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will a decrease,</v>

627
00:32:15.651 --> 00:32:19.880
<v Speaker 2>denies a and D Westernized Society and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be no Europe in,</v>

628
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.520
<v Speaker 2>in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years.</v>

629
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.593
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America actually cares about retaining </v>

630
00:32:25.901 --> 00:32:29.030
<v Speaker 2>the Judeo Christian bases because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows what,</v>

631
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.500
<v Speaker 2>what George Washington said in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>farewell address,</v>

632
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.260
<v Speaker 2>you or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or was it the second inaugural?</v>

633
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:37.690
<v Speaker 2>No second year old is Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what he said,</v>

634
00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I guess the farewell address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who thinks that a,</v>

635
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you can have a survival of morality </v>
<v Speaker 2>without religion is thinking foolishly,</v>

636
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 2>and this guy was no fundamentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

637
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:52.124
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

638
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 2>the founders understood no garden of </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty.</v>

639
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.610
<v Speaker 2>No God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no small government,</v>

640
00:32:58.611 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 2>no god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no good and evil.</v>

641
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people like you,</v>

642
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:04.310
<v Speaker 2>I have no doubt that you're a good pr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

643
00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the of a little louder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

644
00:33:06.711 --> 00:33:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have a little doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

645
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.160
<v Speaker 2>you strike me as for a whole host of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>

646
00:33:11.161 --> 00:33:14.630
<v Speaker 2>a very decent and an inquiring mind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>

647
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I know that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you weren't the product of the Judeo</v>

648
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Christian system that you no longer hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>by.</v>

649
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.653
<v Speaker 2>So my question to you is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to pass this on to </v>

650
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:30.200
<v Speaker 2>generation after generation and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being passed.</v>

651
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.330
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of kids today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indeed for the last 25,</v>

652
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:36.164
<v Speaker 2>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would save their dog before a human </v>

653
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.350
<v Speaker 2>because they love their dog and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't love the stranger.</v>

654
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.633
<v Speaker 2>They say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're proudly announced I would save </v>

655
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:50.390
<v Speaker 2>my dog because we don't have objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality which says,</v>

656
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:52.640
<v Speaker 2>man is created in God's image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs or not,</v>

657
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.660
<v Speaker 2>we have subjective morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you love?</v>

658
00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.613
<v Speaker 2>I love my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this must have put you in a strange </v>

659
00:34:00.111 --> 00:34:00.944
<v Speaker 2>position with trump though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think out of all of the </v>

660
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Republicans that you could've chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

661
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.673
<v Speaker 2>You certainly could have said Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you certainly could have said Marco </v>

662
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Rubio said he probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was my last choice,</v>

663
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:13.094
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's the only one who could have </v>

664
00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:15.770
<v Speaker 2>defeated the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

665
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.693
<v Speaker 2>so that concept of defeating that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that even superseded what supersedes </v>

666
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 2>everything right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left is so neolistic of force in the</v>

667
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:26.690
<v Speaker 2>world that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

668
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.180
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost anything supersedes.</v>

669
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a level of evil that I </v>

670
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:31.784
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't vote for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously a to even to the feet the </v>

671
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:36.010
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

672
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.960
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no such living Republican.</v>

673
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for,</v>

674
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.903
<v Speaker 3>let's say a long time fan of yours that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you got emails like this that </v>

675
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

676
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I know prager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

677
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:46.274
<v Speaker 3>he's moral and he's decent and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things he's voting for a guy are </v>

678
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:50.920
<v Speaker 3>now supporting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

679
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:51.763
<v Speaker 3>I get that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's now supporting a guy who will say </v>

680
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:54.860
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants tweets.</v>

681
00:34:54.861 --> 00:34:55.694
<v Speaker 3>All this crazy stuff is a narcissist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what is moral </v>

682
00:34:57.591 --> 00:34:58.071
<v Speaker 3>centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

683
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:01.050
<v Speaker 3>that's what I kept saying the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>time is I just don't know what the guy,</v>

684
00:35:01.051 --> 00:35:01.884
<v Speaker 3>his moral center is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a chance where things </v>

685
00:35:03.021 --> 00:35:03.854
<v Speaker 3>are going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

686
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know his moral said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said there were two doors,</v>

687
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:12.270
<v Speaker 2>man eating lie and the Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a man eating lion.</v>

688
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.280
<v Speaker 2>That's trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So between maybe indefinite,</v>

689
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:16.820
<v Speaker 2>of course I'll vote for maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

690
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:21.070
<v Speaker 2>So then is this just a completely unique</v>
<v Speaker 2>political situation?</v>

691
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything in your life that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can remember?</v>

692
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an article in one of the major</v>

693
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.233
<v Speaker 2>papers today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was the times or the </v>

694
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of them,</v>

695
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the uniqueness.</v>

696
00:35:33.581 --> 00:35:36.550
<v Speaker 2>This is a whole new episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like Jackson,</v>

697
00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Jackson transformed the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>FDR transform the country.</v>

698
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 2>This might be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformative moments.</v>

699
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:44.184
<v Speaker 2>It might be the end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of at least one of the parties as we </v>

700
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:46.884
<v Speaker 2>know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a whole host of things that </v>

701
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:49.770
<v Speaker 2>could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what'll happen.</v>

702
00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I do know this though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

703
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:53.064
<v Speaker 2>and I say this to the conservatives who </v>
<v Speaker 2>call in and are still sort of never </v>

704
00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 2>trumpers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

705
00:35:58.261 --> 00:36:02.700
<v Speaker 2>if somebody would have given you his </v>
<v Speaker 2>cabinet list a year ago and said,</v>

706
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 2>we don't know who the nominee will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this will be the cabinet while would</v>

707
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:07.344
<v Speaker 2>you have said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would have said we would have </v>

708
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:10.104
<v Speaker 2>been ecstatic.</v>

709
00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So ironically,</v>

710
00:36:11.451 --> 00:36:15.530
<v Speaker 3>he ended up going more conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrect in his cabinet then he ran on.</v>

711
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.550
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got the,</v>

712
00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.653
<v Speaker 3>he's got the trump people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Manga people are annoyed at him </v>

713
00:36:19.851 --> 00:36:22.310
<v Speaker 3>about the cabinet and the Conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>are going,</v>

714
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if the trump people are.</v>

715
00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.173
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think there's a sense that </v>

716
00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:27.530
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

717
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.181
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

718
00:36:28.181 --> 00:36:33.020
<v Speaker 3>they have their own power sort of are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who were not conservative,</v>

719
00:36:33.021 --> 00:36:36.230
<v Speaker 3>who voted for him don't care who he </v>
<v Speaker 3>points to cabinet.</v>

720
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.390
<v Speaker 3>They care whether we improves the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy.</v>

721
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.433
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's a danger in just </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the cult of personality around </v>

722
00:36:42.171 --> 00:36:43.004
<v Speaker 3>him that we have a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it really is superseding logic and </v>

723
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:46.604
<v Speaker 3>reason and even if you end up liking </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the things and he lowered some </v>

724
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.960
<v Speaker 3>taxes and we don't get involved in crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>military things,</v>

725
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.910
<v Speaker 3>do you think just that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Culta personality now?</v>

726
00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:53.744
<v Speaker 3>We certainly had it with Obama too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a different way answered my </v>

727
00:36:56.271 --> 00:36:57.170
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

728
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I answered my question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your question.</v>

729
00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:00.303
<v Speaker 3>That's well said.</v>

730
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.383
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be very difficult to match the </v>

731
00:37:05.051 --> 00:37:07.570
<v Speaker 2>amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cultiness around Obama.</v>

732
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 3>So the change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I mentioned at the,</v>

733
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:11.763
<v Speaker 3>at the top of the show before you sat </v>
<v Speaker 3>down that the change Obama came in with </v>

734
00:37:14.241 --> 00:37:17.300
<v Speaker 3>hope and change in a certain respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't a lot of change.</v>

735
00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 3>He did some things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He changed.</v>

736
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:20.703
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are some of the things that he </v>

737
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.840
<v Speaker 3>changed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He changed</v>

738
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.210
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what percentage of the economy?</v>

739
00:37:26.211 --> 00:37:29.420
<v Speaker 2>His health and he changed that to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>toward a one,</v>

740
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:33.110
<v Speaker 2>a one payer economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a huge change.</v>

741
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

742
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I think everything he changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he did,</v>

743
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.053
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he changed America's role in the world </v>

744
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.720
<v Speaker 2>to being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming a bystander.</v>

745
00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

746
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.423
<v Speaker 2>Assad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a red line in Syria if you use </v>

747
00:37:46.461 --> 00:37:50.090
<v Speaker 2>chemical biological weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he uses those weapons.</v>

748
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

749
00:37:51.741 --> 00:37:53.570
<v Speaker 2>so it's a green light to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ran,</v>

750
00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:57.260
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia takes over Crimea.</v>

751
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really unfortunate.</v>

752
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what?</v>

753
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I still won't arm the Ukrainian </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

754
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.991
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>

755
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:04.824
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is back down in every incident than </v>

756
00:38:06.531 --> 00:38:07.364
<v Speaker 2>the agreement with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only government in the world that </v>

757
00:38:10.131 --> 00:38:12.770
<v Speaker 2>isn't announced that wishes to commit </v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide.</v>

758
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty,</v>

759
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 2>pretty significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

760
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.250
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and court is a great Tome Mutek phrase,</v>

761
00:38:19.251 --> 00:38:22.610
<v Speaker 2>those who are kind to the cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be cruel to the kind.</v>

762
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.880
<v Speaker 2>So the nicer he got to Iran and unlike </v>
<v Speaker 2>my and Castro,</v>

763
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tougher he got onto Tanya,</v>

764
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.950
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is classic rule of history.</v>

765
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 2>It's a 2000 old from the Talmud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those who are kind to the cruel,</v>

766
00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:43.681
<v Speaker 2>be cruel to the kind of Obama and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left perfectly encapsulate that vision.</v>

767
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 2>So I suspect I know your answer to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but going to Israel for just a second,</v>

768
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:50.830
<v Speaker 2>you're a big defender of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw your,</v>

769
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I think you did a video before prager u </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Israel.</v>

770
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Did you do saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

771
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.093
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was even before I knew about </v>

772
00:38:58.541 --> 00:38:59.790
<v Speaker 2>that was a viral one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

773
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Where you gave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought a very thoughtful,</v>

774
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 2>historically accurate version of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is.</v>

775
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:06.970
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know the big line I think.</v>

776
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.863
<v Speaker 2>Well let you say that line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically what you say about the other </v>

777
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:11.704
<v Speaker 2>side Pid and the headline was yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if tomorrow is real announced we are </v>

778
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:17.770
<v Speaker 2>fighting no more.</v>

779
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:18.603
<v Speaker 2>We are disbanding our army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are dismantling our armaments a what </v>

780
00:39:24.411 --> 00:39:28.240
<v Speaker 2>would happen the next day and if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabs announced,</v>

781
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are laying down our arms,</v>

782
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:31.474
<v Speaker 2>we are fighting Israel no more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would happen the next day in that </v>

783
00:39:33.731 --> 00:39:34.564
<v Speaker 2>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first scenario they would be </v>

784
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 2>genocide Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israelis would be wiped out.</v>

785
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:39.963
<v Speaker 2>They would be mass murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>torture and rape in the streets of </v>

786
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The on the other scenario,</v>

787
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:46.710
<v Speaker 2>there would be peace within a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

788
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.520
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I basically agree with that.</v>

789
00:39:48.521 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is the obsession with Israel?</v>

790
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:52.414
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I pointed out the day of the century </v>

791
00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.461
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

792
00:39:54.461 --> 00:39:55.294
<v Speaker 2>the especially the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I pointed out the day of the Kerry </v>

793
00:39:56.681 --> 00:39:57.514
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted a image of the entire Middle </v>

794
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.120
<v Speaker 2>East with one little orange sliver </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst all of this other stuff.</v>

795
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.940
<v Speaker 2>And this thing is tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

796
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:05.803
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think including the West Bank nine </v>

797
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:10.260
<v Speaker 2>miles wide at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

798
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 2>you could have rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have one international airport,</v>

799
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.653
<v Speaker 2>but one place where gays and atheists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Christians and the high and all of </v>

800
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:20.290
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the only place where you can see an</v>

801
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:23.980
<v Speaker 2>orthodox Jewish man on a bus sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>next to a woman in a hijab.</v>

802
00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the one place in coexistence and </v>

803
00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:27.154
<v Speaker 2>they're obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is where I feel like I've </v>

804
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:29.734
<v Speaker 2>completely lost left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have tried desperately to bring some </v>

805
00:40:31.961 --> 00:40:34.060
<v Speaker 2>clarity to this and I don't know that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

806
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.320
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the obsession?</v>

807
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.460
<v Speaker 2>What's in the final analysis you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hit,</v>

808
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:43.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my one of my deepest beliefs in life.</v>

809
00:40:43.241 --> 00:40:46.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's a religious belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Jew,</v>

810
00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:51.160
<v Speaker 2>hatred and Israel hatred is Jew hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not criticism of Israel.</v>

811
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has ever said if you criticize,</v>

812
00:40:54.241 --> 00:40:55.074
<v Speaker 2>is really are an antisemite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you support those who wish to </v>

813
00:40:57.821 --> 00:41:00.780
<v Speaker 2>destroy Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you feel that you're a Jew,</v>

814
00:41:00.781 --> 00:41:03.100
<v Speaker 2>hater or not is irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

815
00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I want Italy destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say I'm not anti Italian.</v>

816
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why?</v>

817
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Of all the 200 plus countries on earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>is only one targeted for destruction.</v>

818
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:17.403
<v Speaker 2>And by sheer coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the only Jewish country in the </v>

819
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:20.710
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

820
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.543
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of all the people in the world is only </v>

821
00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:27.550
<v Speaker 2>one bid targeted for true genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We speak genocide here,</v>

822
00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.470
<v Speaker 2>genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genocide everywhere.</v>

823
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.890
<v Speaker 2>But the one true genocide take every </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

824
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:33.943
<v Speaker 2>Every child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every grandparent who was a Jew and </v>

825
00:41:36.651 --> 00:41:38.180
<v Speaker 2>gassed them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughter them,</v>

826
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 2>shoot them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bury them.</v>

827
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Only Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jew hatred is the own.</v>

828
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book on this called why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews,</v>

829
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Jew hatred is the only hatred that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extermination list.</v>

830
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.393
<v Speaker 2>That's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whites who hated blacks did not wish to </v>

831
00:41:56.181 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 2>exterminate all blacks you name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a terrible hatred.</v>

832
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:03.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not a defensive it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no other.</v>

833
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.023
<v Speaker 2>There was a desire to wipe out the Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the desire to wipe out Israel is </v>

834
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 2>part of the desire to wipe out the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is,</v>

835
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:14.743
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a reason that I believe in the </v>

836
00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 2>truth ultimately of the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

837
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.390
<v Speaker 2>especially the first five books of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Torah,</v>

838
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.260
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when God chose the Jews,</v>

839
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:28.423
<v Speaker 2>this chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this led them to be the world's hated </v>

840
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:33.020
<v Speaker 2>people because they ended up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience of the world.</v>

841
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.630
<v Speaker 3>So is the irony that I think if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>took,</v>

842
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.493
<v Speaker 3>I think you've talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you have talked about this and </v>

843
00:42:37.941 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 3>I think it was one of your books </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

844
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.230
<v Speaker 3>that if you took most Jews in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're totally secular.</v>

845
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 3>They've sorted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most are totally left this.</v>

846
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.520
<v Speaker 3>So I think Ben Shapiro is Trey Trey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

847
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.570
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

848
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:51.370
<v Speaker 3>they've traded their religiosity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>lefties.</v>

849
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben Shapiro.</v>

850
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying it's in spending,</v>

851
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.590
<v Speaker 3>but not from valley before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born.</v>

852
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

853
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.413
<v Speaker 2>but that is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Ben is right and whoever says it is </v>

854
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:05.990
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

855
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jews,</v>

856
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews are.</v>

857
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:15.670
<v Speaker 2>The way I put is Jews are too isms want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italians are to operas it.</v>

858
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

859
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Every ism Jews either created or lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>the except for Nazis,</v>

860
00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.500
<v Speaker 2>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanism,</v>

861
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:29.320
<v Speaker 2>socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live cap cap.</v>

862
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

863
00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

864
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.720
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not an ideology.</v>

865
00:43:32.721 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 2>That's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an economic way.</v>

866
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

867
00:43:35.551 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalism,</v>

868
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 2>feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>betty free.</v>

869
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

870
00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:39.911
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

871
00:43:39.911 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 2>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trotsky.</v>

872
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Three of the possible successors to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lennon at pamas death.</v>

873
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Three of the five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were only five people.</v>

874
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Three of the three of them commented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>synovium,</v>

875
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.230
<v Speaker 2>and Trotsky would choose Jews Bukhara </v>
<v Speaker 2>and install them.</v>

876
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.070
<v Speaker 2>We're not Jewish.</v>

877
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.320
<v Speaker 3>So in an odd way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Laurent,</v>

878
00:43:55.390 --> 00:44:00.220
<v Speaker 3>you making an argument against religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>here because if the idea is that,</v>

879
00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:01.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the chosen group.</v>

880
00:44:01.931 --> 00:44:02.970
<v Speaker 3>And look what you know as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

881
00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:03.813
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms [inaudible] said in fiddler on the </v>

882
00:44:04.991 --> 00:44:05.824
<v Speaker 3>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wish we had been chosen for </v>

883
00:44:06.401 --> 00:44:07.234
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

884
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.093
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that actually an argument against </v>

885
00:44:09.641 --> 00:44:12.040
<v Speaker 3>religion because the Jews were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>set up,</v>

886
00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:14.670
<v Speaker 3>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's divine or manmade,</v>

887
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:15.583
<v Speaker 3>that there was a setup that guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be exterminated and </v>

888
00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:20.140
<v Speaker 3>kicked across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you would have asked,</v>

889
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:20.973
<v Speaker 3>ask me</v>

890
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 2>if you would have a fight had been at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sinai and I would have been told this is</v>

891
00:44:26.611 --> 00:44:29.820
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen to the Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they are chosen.</v>

892
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 2>I would have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

893
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no thanks.</v>

894
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Have you been to Sinai?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

895
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.110
<v Speaker 2>it is ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Did you have any religious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm not,</v>

897
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:47.650
<v Speaker 2>that's not the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am moved by the text more than I am by</v>

898
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:48.720
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

899
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 2>physical place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

900
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm atypical in that way.</v>

901
00:44:52.411 --> 00:44:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't get old that choked up at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

902
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.720
<v Speaker 2>at any monument or stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

903
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:58.371
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

904
00:44:58.371 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 2>so one more thing on this and then we'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>move to a couple of other issues.</v>

905
00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.573
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about also that the </v>

906
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.620
<v Speaker 2>story has been lost here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the actual history of the land is.</v>

907
00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:11.890
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that I try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain to people that you know,</v>

908
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:12.803
<v Speaker 2>you talk about the partition plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked about the fact that he was </v>

909
00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:15.000
<v Speaker 2>British.</v>

910
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.890
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually part of the Ottoman Empire.</v>

911
00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Before that there were no people called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Palestinian people,</v>

912
00:45:18.961 --> 00:45:19.794
<v Speaker 2>which people will say you're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For they were Arabs there in a notice </v>

913
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Speaker 2>that they were also Jews Palestinian in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1930.</v>

914
00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 2>The people notice as Palestinians were </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jews and there were boys.</v>

915
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can look at New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles where the Arabs were boycotting</v>

916
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Palestine because it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this stuff.</v>

917
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.653
<v Speaker 2>Even when I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm already unleashing a </v>

918
00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:39.204
<v Speaker 2>torrent of hate running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do you beat people that won't </v>

919
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:43.860
<v Speaker 2>accept history?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you either.</v>

920
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 2>There is only in this whole honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there really is no way what we have.</v>

921
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.420
<v Speaker 2>What my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dream with prager university,</v>

922
00:45:51.421 --> 00:45:52.254
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my radio show or anything that I do </v>

923
00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:58.290
<v Speaker 2>publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to say what is true and I know that a</v>

924
00:45:58.291 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 2>certain percentage of people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

925
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

926
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Where is the majority will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

927
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.790
<v Speaker 2>you are a coal you a bad name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what.</v>

928
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.050
<v Speaker 2>So you can only hope that the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who will say,</v>

929
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.213
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that I'm gonna change my </v>

930
00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:23.250
<v Speaker 2>mind is greater than you imagined it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

931
00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.513
<v Speaker 2>That's the only hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's dispiriting that facts don't </v>

932
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:30.210
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

933
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 2>a Hitler said Jesus was an Ra and not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jew,</v>

934
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.710
<v Speaker 2>and the Palestinians say he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestinian,</v>

935
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:38.550
<v Speaker 2>not a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

936
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:44.090
<v Speaker 2>The idea is it's beyond law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.870
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's entering a new realm.</v>

938
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so do you think were post-truth?</v>

939
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.133
<v Speaker 2>Now that seems to be the new truth is </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from the enemies of Western </v>

940
00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:55.044
<v Speaker 2>liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not coming from the right who was </v>

941
00:46:57.631 --> 00:46:58.464
<v Speaker 2>protecting western liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming from the left and from the </v>

942
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Islamists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the irony.</v>

943
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 2>So let's critique the right a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

944
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.260
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have some critiques of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

945
00:47:07.261 --> 00:47:08.094
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that many critiques of the </v>

946
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Writing Center that they don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight.</v>

947
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:15.140
<v Speaker 2>So then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

948
00:47:15.141 --> 00:47:16.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

949
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what they stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They forgot.</v>

950
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.343
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the choir forgot it's </v>

951
00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 2>melodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by and large I have to say,</v>

952
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 2>and I never thought I would have said </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a kid,</v>

953
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:29.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up as a Jew in New York,</v>

954
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.130
<v Speaker 2>but the people on the right that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>met,</v>

955
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:34.743
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there are exceptions because </v>

956
00:47:36.171 --> 00:47:37.004
<v Speaker 2>they were disgusting people on the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're beautiful people on the </v>

957
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:41.260
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by and large,</v>

958
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:42.094
<v Speaker 2>the people on the right that I have met </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been kind and decent and loving </v>

959
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:51.380
<v Speaker 2>they give more charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They adopt more kids from a I,</v>

961
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean just general adoption </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's left and right,</v>

962
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.450
<v Speaker 2>but they adopt.</v>

963
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.490
<v Speaker 2>I was just with a right wing guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

964
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and his wife had two biological </v>

965
00:48:02.471 --> 00:48:07.471
<v Speaker 2>children and then they adopted two more </v>
<v Speaker 2>children from China,</v>

966
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:09.483
<v Speaker 2>not newborns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids with terrible illnesses that is </v>

967
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly done by religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians in America.</v>

968
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not been done by Europeans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not done by secular in America.</v>

969
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there are exceptions,</v>

970
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 2>but overwhelmingly a tiring having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that all the time.</v>

971
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:31.230
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two billion it,</v>

972
00:48:31.231 --> 00:48:33.330
<v Speaker 2>it drives me crazy cause then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

973
00:48:33.331 --> 00:48:37.720
<v Speaker 2>you see yourself quoted and know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to make,</v>

974
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:38.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like clarification for the foolish </v>

975
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.790
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any event,</v>

976
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I've just been touched by the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Jew,</v>

977
00:48:46.691 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I have been overwhelmed by the kindness </v>
<v Speaker 2>of so many evangelical Christians.</v>

978
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so real quick,</v>

979
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:53.770
<v Speaker 2>let's just talk about what you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned there.</v>

980
00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:54.604
<v Speaker 2>Just sort of being a public person where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to measure your words all the </v>

981
00:48:56.981 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

982
00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:58.383
<v Speaker 2>Was it always like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you were doing radio 30 years </v>

983
00:49:00.071 --> 00:49:00.904
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you feel that you had to constantly </v>

984
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:05.410
<v Speaker 2>qualify everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every adjective.</v>

985
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.440
<v Speaker 2>There was no internet to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything you've said and you know,</v>

986
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:14.350
<v Speaker 2>take it out of context or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as it developed,</v>

987
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:19.351
<v Speaker 2>I did take an even earlier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did start with a motto in my brain,</v>

988
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:27.220
<v Speaker 2>be sure that no one sentence can kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

989
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:28.803
<v Speaker 2>And I am very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very careful about how I speak and I'm </v>

990
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:35.194
<v Speaker 2>amazed that in 33 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands of hours of live is </v>

991
00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do anything.</v>

992
00:49:41.621 --> 00:49:43.720
<v Speaker 2>It's live radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

993
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I have never been caught on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on something that could hang me.</v>

994
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.520
<v Speaker 2>You just jinxed yourself horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see?</v>

995
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very scientific superstition.</v>

996
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

997
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.700
<v Speaker 2>do you think that there's just a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of mental space that,</v>

998
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:00.543
<v Speaker 2>that takes up even having to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because that's what I talk about </v>

999
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Swat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons I leave the show,</v>

1000
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just went through,</v>

1001
00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

1002
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I work out harder in the show than with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my trainer at the gym just to see,</v>

1003
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 2>just to sort of contain the potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>errors.</v>

1004
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a chess game if it's a three hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmaster chess game,</v>

1005
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:23.403
<v Speaker 2>and I suspect you would argue that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that has to do again with the left </v>

1006
00:50:26.711 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 2>and the buzzword because</v>

1007
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.990
<v Speaker 3>they pinned everybody into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1008
00:50:29.991 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I wrote it</v>

1009
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:31.483
<v Speaker 2>piece every so often I write pieces that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are nothing to do with politics or </v>

1010
00:50:37.171 --> 00:50:40.440
<v Speaker 2>religion or anything but have to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the private sphere.</v>

1011
00:50:40.441 --> 00:50:44.430
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote a piece about eight years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1012
00:50:44.431 --> 00:50:49.431
<v Speaker 2>My syndicated column was a when a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a wife is not in the mood,</v>

1013
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:54.330
<v Speaker 2>obviously for sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

1014
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.160
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1015
00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.440
<v Speaker 2>my argument is that if you love your </v>
<v Speaker 2>husband,</v>

1016
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:02.303
<v Speaker 2>if you have a loving marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a good man and knowing how </v>

1017
00:51:05.041 --> 00:51:09.630
<v Speaker 2>important sex is to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that even if you're not in the mood,</v>

1018
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:15.830
<v Speaker 2>why not give it a try because we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be guided by moods.</v>

1019
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.350
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1020
00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:18.383
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wrote what if you're not in the </v>

1021
00:51:19.591 --> 00:51:22.200
<v Speaker 2>mood to go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1022
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:24.150
<v Speaker 2>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go to war.</v>

1023
00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:29.410
<v Speaker 2>So guess walk to the daily Co's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1024
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.960
<v Speaker 2>they read my piece and the daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>headlines,</v>

1025
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.790
<v Speaker 2>prager advocates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marital rape.</v>

1026
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.700
<v Speaker 3>And then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you spend any time trying to clean it</v>

1027
00:51:40.701 --> 00:51:41.534
<v Speaker 3>up or do you do</v>

1028
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.480
<v Speaker 2>about possible to clean up the left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1029
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I will just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for the record,</v>

1030
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.203
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a man at the daily Co's who </v>

1031
00:51:49.921 --> 00:51:52.650
<v Speaker 2>writes the road with the next issue or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1032
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Next day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next week.</v>

1033
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prager,</v>

1034
00:51:56.991 --> 00:51:57.870
<v Speaker 2>rees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing.</v>

1035
00:51:57.871 --> 00:51:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I can't stand them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make it clear.</v>

1036
00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I can stand them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I say</v>

1037
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:04.560
<v Speaker 3>can stand there and then says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but give me a break.</v>

1038
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:05.423
<v Speaker 3>The guy did not advocate marital rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what does that say about just the </v>

1039
00:52:08.701 --> 00:52:11.600
<v Speaker 3>state of affairs in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet then because I'm.</v>

1040
00:52:11.601 --> 00:52:12.434
<v Speaker 3>I'm very enthused by the fact that I do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this show on the Internet and I can do </v>

1041
00:52:15.301 --> 00:52:17.850
<v Speaker 3>whatever I want and say we've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>

1042
00:52:17.851 --> 00:52:18.684
<v Speaker 3>The barrier to entry is low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is getting a lot of great people </v>

1043
00:52:20.551 --> 00:52:21.300
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1044
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.970
<v Speaker 3>That comes with a whole series of </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems because anyone can get in,</v>

1045
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.313
<v Speaker 3>any idiot can put on a suit and sit at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>desk and pretend they know what they're </v>

1046
00:52:27.691 --> 00:52:28.860
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So huge problems,</v>

1047
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:32.130
<v Speaker 3>but when you think about just that </v>
<v Speaker 3>general state of that,</v>

1048
00:52:32.131 --> 00:52:34.500
<v Speaker 3>our media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody trusts anybody anymore.</v>

1049
00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:35.733
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1050
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:38.940
<v Speaker 3>that sort of trick is to learn who mia </v>
<v Speaker 3>can trust.</v>

1051
00:52:38.941 --> 00:52:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1052
00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's not all that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1053
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:44.560
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look in the final analysis,</v>

1054
00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:49.561
<v Speaker 2>I always say credibility is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest source of power.</v>

1055
00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:55.120
<v Speaker 2>The A and I have taken that very </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

1056
00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't take sponsors that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally endorse A.</v>

1057
00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:00.573
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say no to a lot of sponsors because </v>

1058
00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.810
<v Speaker 2>like I'll just give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1059
00:53:04.811 --> 00:53:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm not hurting any sponsor here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1060
00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:11.890
<v Speaker 2>we're fan funded so you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a sponsored funded.</v>

1061
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.870
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was asked,</v>

1062
00:53:13.871 --> 00:53:14.770
<v Speaker 2>I was asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1063
00:53:14.771 --> 00:53:19.300
<v Speaker 2>he was a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was asked to advertise your mattress,</v>

1064
00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.960
<v Speaker 2>a fine mattress I might add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1065
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1066
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:25.023
<v Speaker 2>I believe that I have the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>mattress in the world which I currently </v>

1067
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.983
<v Speaker 2>do sleep on and I can't therefore say </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the mattress I sleep on even </v>

1068
00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:38.370
<v Speaker 2>though they'll send me a free mattress.</v>

1069
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:41.730
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I told them that.</v>

1070
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I said I will happily say it's a fine </v>
<v Speaker 2>mattress,</v>

1071
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:49.320
<v Speaker 2>but I will not say it's the best and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>will not say I sleep on it.</v>

1072
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.790
<v Speaker 2>So I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very careful about credibility,</v>

1073
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to know whom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whom you can trust.</v>

1074
00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:57.803
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is whom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to know a lot certain </v>

1075
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:04.430
<v Speaker 2>things should strike you at the outset </v>
<v Speaker 2>as is,</v>

1076
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a little too bizarre to be real.</v>

1077
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.150
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got to verify it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:10.403
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of just how people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being funded by all sorts of crazy </v>

1079
00:54:14.371 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 2>things right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1080
00:54:15.511 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 2>like Pierre Omidyar finds Glenn </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greenwald's intercept.</v>

1081
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you probably don't love that </v>
<v Speaker 2>site roar,</v>

1082
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever's funding salon or Al Jazeera </v>

1083
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.750
<v Speaker 2>funds the young Turks or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

1084
00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:29.100
<v Speaker 2>which is funded by part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government of Qatar or any of this stuff</v>

1085
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:29.963
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another problem we have that now </v>

1086
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.390
<v Speaker 2>we don't know where money's coming from </v>
<v Speaker 2>with everybody.</v>

1087
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Like just everything has been open to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1088
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:35.903
<v Speaker 2>This is a real problem because </v>
<v Speaker 2>transparency is not the answer either </v>

1089
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.380
<v Speaker 2>because as we found out in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1090
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:43.223
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street </v>

1091
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Journal wrote a very powerful book on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1092
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:48.833
<v Speaker 2>The transparency issue has given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left a way to ruin the law wives of </v>

1093
00:54:55.531 --> 00:54:58.470
<v Speaker 2>funders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of conservative foundations,</v>

1094
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:01.740
<v Speaker 2>which we don't do the boycott their </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses,</v>

1095
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:04.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>announce publicly.</v>

1096
00:55:04.831 --> 00:55:08.760
<v Speaker 2>These are haters and people don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>that misery in their lives.</v>

1097
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.060
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason the left wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>transparency of donors.</v>

1098
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:13.103
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very complex question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they take plenty of money </v>

1099
00:55:15.301 --> 00:55:17.820
<v Speaker 2>from Soros and a whole series of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1100
00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they've partly learned that this</v>

1101
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:23.340
<v Speaker 2>stuff doesn't work because even when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kellogg's just a couple of weeks ago,</v>

1102
00:55:23.341 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 2>or was it two months ago or so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing with Breitbart.</v>

1103
00:55:26.521 --> 00:55:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Well then what happened while they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>breitbart?</v>

1104
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.100
<v Speaker 2>People stopped eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kellogg's.</v>

1105
00:55:29.101 --> 00:55:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1106
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:30.511
<v Speaker 2>but we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

1107
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:32.670
<v Speaker 2>we've come into a place where companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they have to.</v>

1108
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political has also left created.</v>

1109
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about if,</v>

1110
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:39.870
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a company.</v>

1111
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Look I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my perfect example,</v>

1112
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Ben and Jerry's ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben and Jerry,</v>

1113
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 2>if you go left and Ben and Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in London territory,</v>

1114
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:49.823
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat Ben and Jerry ice cream because I </v>

1115
00:55:52.321 --> 00:55:53.154
<v Speaker 2>don't believe that the free market </v>
<v Speaker 2>should allow me to boycott based on </v>

1116
00:55:56.671 --> 00:56:00.540
<v Speaker 2>their ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not what the left believes.</v>

1117
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.510
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1118
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:03.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you supported trump.</v>

1119
00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 2>We want you to be bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they think.</v>

1120
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:11.400
<v Speaker 2>We will ruin your company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

1121
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:15.360
<v Speaker 2>while I'm sure you do not like any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas of Bernie Sanders,</v>

1122
00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:16.890
<v Speaker 2>they loved Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you said,</v>

1123
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I liked their ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to eat their ice cream.</v>

1124
00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my belief.</v>

1125
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:23.100
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can let it be at that and not.</v>

1126
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the ideal.</v>

1127
00:56:24.611 --> 00:56:27.970
<v Speaker 2>That's was the American ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left has made that impossible.</v>

1128
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 2>The left is so constantly boycotting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone they differ with.</v>

1129
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:33.993
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was it,</v>

1130
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chick filet,</v>

1131
00:56:35.051 --> 00:56:37.630
<v Speaker 2>the guy believes that marriage should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>defined as male,</v>

1132
00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 2>female and he should be put out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>phase,</v>

1133
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 2>not allowed in New York and Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's an absurdity.</v>

1134
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:48.760
<v Speaker 2>If the guy advocate same sex marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would I not eat his ice cream?</v>

1135
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm a conservative religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

1136
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:52.510
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that</v>

1137
00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.110
<v Speaker 3>such virtue signaling to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember during that whole chick filet</v>

1138
00:56:56.150 --> 00:57:00.500
<v Speaker 3>thing and I was on o'reilly arguing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about chick filet and then shortly after</v>

1139
00:57:00.501 --> 00:57:01.334
<v Speaker 3>that I was on the young Turks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a progressive network and </v>

1140
00:57:03.261 --> 00:57:04.094
<v Speaker 3>they're screaming about chick fil a the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole time I'm openly gay and I worked </v>

1141
00:57:06.651 --> 00:57:08.150
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care that much actually.</v>

1142
00:57:08.151 --> 00:57:08.984
<v Speaker 3>I just thought this is one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that were just outraged about </v>

1143
00:57:10.911 --> 00:57:11.744
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy walked into the production </v>

1144
00:57:12.741 --> 00:57:13.980
<v Speaker 3>meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating chick filet,</v>

1145
00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.190
<v Speaker 3>and I thought if anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean guys,</v>

1146
00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:17.383
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like you're out there screaming </v>

1147
00:57:19.401 --> 00:57:21.980
<v Speaker 3>about chick filet and here you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating chick fil a way.</v>

1148
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.023
<v Speaker 3>So that also shows sort of just like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>general inconsistent is that everybody </v>

1149
00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:26.480
<v Speaker 3>has across the board probably.</v>

1150
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:27.813
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think the right boycotts </v>

1151
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:31.803
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1152
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the instinct that the left does.</v>

1153
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even think of an analogy.</v>

1154
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just you take a position we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1155
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:41.974
<v Speaker 2>we want you out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oddly Ben and Jerry's or big Israel </v>

1156
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:45.034
<v Speaker 2>supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they,</v>

1157
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 2>they're big walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they big supporters of Israel?</v>

1158
00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:48.730
<v Speaker 2>They have a couple of accounts there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1159
00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.640
<v Speaker 2>So they've confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

1160
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1161
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.201
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's just,</v>

1162
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 2>let's just knock out a couple</v>

1163
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.850
<v Speaker 3>bull other issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just talk about hot topics.</v>

1164
00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.700
<v Speaker 3>So gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1165
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:03.100
<v Speaker 3>as a man that I sent you don't govern by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible.</v>

1166
00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of what you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>

1167
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think</v>

1168
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.320
<v Speaker 2>values come from your values come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible,</v>

1169
00:58:09.321 --> 00:58:11.480
<v Speaker 2>but you're not governing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1170
00:58:11.481 --> 00:58:12.470
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1171
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:16.490
<v Speaker 2>the Bible says do not murder governing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1172
00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1173
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:21.050
<v Speaker 2>but if the Bible didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing the Dennis prager would not</v>

1174
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:22.280
<v Speaker 2>be a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

1175
00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:23.240
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1176
00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.020
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1177
00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.990
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not sure that society would have</v>

1178
00:58:26.991 --> 00:58:27.824
<v Speaker 2>created much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not murder emphasis of the toughest </v>

1179
00:58:32.421 --> 00:58:36.770
<v Speaker 2>group for the Catholic Church to convert</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a Germanic tribes of Europe because</v>

1180
00:58:36.771 --> 00:58:37.604
<v Speaker 2>they didn't buy the notion of the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>commandments and specifically do not </v>

1181
00:58:40.491 --> 00:58:41.870
<v Speaker 2>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not murder,</v>

1182
00:58:41.871 --> 00:58:44.180
<v Speaker 2>which is really what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they said,</v>

1183
00:58:44.181 --> 00:58:47.000
<v Speaker 2>what are you nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're stronger,</v>

1184
00:58:47.001 --> 00:58:49.760
<v Speaker 2>you kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no argument against that.</v>

1185
00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Only if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1186
00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.453
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The creator of the universe says it's </v>

1187
00:58:54.381 --> 00:58:55.550
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

1188
00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

1189
00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily rolling.</v>

1190
00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:02.900
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what I would think if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had not been affected by,</v>

1191
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.880
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1192
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.100
<v Speaker 2>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3000 years of the Bible.</v>

1193
00:59:07.101 --> 00:59:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will be honest to this.</v>

1194
00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1195
00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

1196
00:59:12.661 --> 00:59:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of setting myself up to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged here,</v>

1197
00:59:15.201 --> 00:59:20.201
<v Speaker 2>but it's okay if the Bible said nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about homosexuality,</v>

1198
00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the odds are,</v>

1199
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:27.561
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1200
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:28.394
<v Speaker 2>If the Bible said nothing about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance of male female distinction </v>

1201
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I need to explain in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

1202
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1203
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my heart is with gay marriage.</v>

1204
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1205
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 2>my wife and I have a number and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know people mock it,</v>

1206
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:45.590
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's lockable,</v>

1207
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're very close to two gay couples.</v>

1208
00:59:49.401 --> 00:59:52.400
<v Speaker 2>One female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one male and the females,</v>

1209
00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 2>my niece and then her and her wife and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1210
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:56.451
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the male,</v>

1211
00:59:56.451 --> 00:59:58.440
<v Speaker 2>their partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get married but they,</v>

1212
00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:59.480
<v Speaker 2>they're like married.</v>

1213
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.760
<v Speaker 2>What's the makeable part there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1214
01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:02.241
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1215
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:04.200
<v Speaker 2>when anybody says some of my best </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

1216
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:09.060
<v Speaker 2>but we're so close to these couples that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1217
01:00:09.061 --> 01:00:09.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1218
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.420
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I really objected,</v>

1219
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:13.490
<v Speaker 2>it would be hard to be that close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1220
01:00:13.491 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1221
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:16.340
<v Speaker 2>if my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my heart is with them,</v>

1222
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:18.290
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1223
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:22.670
<v Speaker 2>but my value system warned me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the key thing on,</v>

1224
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I predicted this from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1225
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:25.484
<v Speaker 2>the reason that same sex marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>troubles me is primarily that it makes </v>

1226
01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:34.760
<v Speaker 2>the following announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gender doesn't matter,</v>

1227
01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:36.613
<v Speaker 2>because that is the argument whom the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender of whom you married doesn't </v>

1228
01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:41.054
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental argument of same </v>

1229
01:00:42.921 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 2>sex marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So far I'm okay with,</v>

1230
01:00:45.561 --> 01:00:46.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1231
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.461
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1232
01:00:46.461 --> 01:00:48.680
<v Speaker 2>It's really logical what I'm about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1233
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.920
<v Speaker 2>This has nothing to do with the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will in a moment,</v>

1234
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:55.580
<v Speaker 2>but it has to still be logical even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's biblical.</v>

1235
01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:01.060
<v Speaker 2>So if gender doesn't matter in marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>than gender won't matter,</v>

1236
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:06.260
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have left the uh,</v>

1237
01:01:06.261 --> 01:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>the proverbial a Bot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the horses out of the barn?</v>

1238
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Once you announced gender?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>

1239
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Golly,</v>

1240
01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:15.704
<v Speaker 2>gender doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now that's exactly what it said on </v>

1241
01:01:19.611 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 2>the progressive side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gender doesn't matter.</v>

1242
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in thousands of schools in America,</v>

1243
01:01:26.241 --> 01:01:27.074
<v Speaker 2>teachers are told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not call your elementary school </v>

1244
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:30.554
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys and girls call them students </v>

1245
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.950
<v Speaker 2>because you cannot impose a gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity on them.</v>

1246
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Let them choose their gender identity if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want one later in life.</v>

1247
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get the slippery slope thing there.</v>

1248
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:46.483
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1249
01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.483
<v Speaker 2>you can look at my twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mock these people all day long with </v>

1250
01:01:49.341 --> 01:01:54.341
<v Speaker 2>these ridiculous fried frame it came </v>
<v Speaker 2>from changing it in marriage.</v>

1251
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>

1252
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 2>So there's sort of two things there.</v>

1253
01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:57.733
<v Speaker 2>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the original point about gay </v>

1254
01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 2>marriage and then just the slippery </v>
<v Speaker 2>slope that.</v>

1255
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.420
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's just separate those two things.</v>

1256
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:03.254
<v Speaker 2>So in terms of the gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feeling always was I should just be </v>

1257
01:02:07.161 --> 01:02:09.830
<v Speaker 2>treated equally under the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes make sense,</v>

1258
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.693
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to enter a contract with </v>

1259
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.100
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens to be a man,</v>

1260
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You unedited that same contract with and</v>

1261
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand that and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew going to happen and the price</v>

1262
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:23.160
<v Speaker 2>is too great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would,</v>

1263
01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I would want the gay persons have every </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1264
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:26.874
<v Speaker 2>And I know this is not the same as </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage and I knew every argument that </v>

1265
01:02:29.151 --> 01:02:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I know every argument against it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their sound they are,</v>

1266
01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.050
<v Speaker 2>it's to sound arguments against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1267
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 2>But if I think macro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just micro,</v>

1268
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.083
<v Speaker 2>my concern is not just the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for the whole society and I'm </v>

1269
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:48.024
<v Speaker 2>afraid the society has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has chosen wrong in this matter because </v>

1270
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:54.810
<v Speaker 2>of the gender doesn't matter issue.</v>

1271
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:56.610
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1272
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:57.444
<v Speaker 2>So basically I sense you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say you don't particularly care because </v>

1273
01:03:01.051 --> 01:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>you're a caring person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

1274
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.980
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't bother you in,</v>

1275
01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:06.210
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the specifics of your.</v>

1276
01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:07.550
<v Speaker 2>In my home studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were on my,</v>

1277
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:08.603
<v Speaker 2>I live here with the names pumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both with these two couples as </v>

1278
01:03:11.941 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 2>with heterosexual couples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1279
01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:14.820
<v Speaker 2>for the record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right before we started,</v>

1280
01:03:14.821 --> 01:03:17.030
<v Speaker 2>you asked me if I was married straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>or gay.</v>

1281
01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.193
<v Speaker 2>I didn't sense that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the immediate concern was how </v>

1282
01:03:21.061 --> 01:03:24.180
<v Speaker 2>did you meet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear your romance.</v>

1283
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm as interested as if it was a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1284
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Because the fist is my view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1285
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.980
<v Speaker 2>you and you are decent and compassionate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the micro,</v>

1286
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.233
<v Speaker 2>but you have to have standards in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>macro s and they are in this one </v>

1287
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:40.973
<v Speaker 2>instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know of another one I can think </v>

1288
01:03:44.281 --> 01:03:44.520
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1289
01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of one other and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>related if you want to hear it,</v>

1290
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:48.510
<v Speaker 2>it's unimportant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1291
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.600
<v Speaker 2>this is the biggest conflict that I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>had and that's why I worked very hard on</v>

1292
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:56.150
<v Speaker 2>this issue to learn what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1293
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.113
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the Bible took the stance that it </v>

1294
01:03:58.531 --> 01:03:59.700
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1295
01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1296
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.420
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning you and me,</v>

1297
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:04.283
<v Speaker 2>whether you're straight or gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are going to pay a price for the </v>

1298
01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:08.364
<v Speaker 2>death of gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The war against gender is a war against </v>

1299
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:14.700
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

1300
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we're getting the slippery slope </v>

1301
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:19.230
<v Speaker 2>portion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that part I would say,</v>

1302
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:20.483
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's possible that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>give people a chance that you let gay </v>

1303
01:04:22.561 --> 01:04:23.394
<v Speaker 2>people get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the legitimate things that you're </v>

1304
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.490
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these silly things.</v>

1305
01:04:26.491 --> 01:04:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I see this where they don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to call them students.</v>

1306
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I saw once where they wanted to call </v>
<v Speaker 2>them comrades.</v>

1307
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:31.104
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1308
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.280
<v Speaker 2>so I get that release stuff and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>labeling and all this nonsense,</v>

1309
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.530
<v Speaker 2>but that may be if you let gay people </v>
<v Speaker 2>get married that they.</v>

1310
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:40.450
<v Speaker 2>They would actually be allied with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>

1311
01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:41.840
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's LG.</v>

1312
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I said some of bb t yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was lgb then they wouldn't be,</v>

1313
01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:53.110
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The see the activists,</v>

1314
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you're separating the activists from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1315
01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:57.863
<v Speaker 2>They're the dominant voice and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones who have the boycotts and </v>

1316
01:05:00.601 --> 01:05:01.434
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones who get gaze angry or </v>
<v Speaker 2>black sangre or Jews angry or women </v>

1317
01:05:05.521 --> 01:05:08.010
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the anger creators,</v>

1318
01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:11.220
<v Speaker 2>the activists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I would have no way.</v>

1319
01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:13.840
<v Speaker 2>We'd have a great life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a nonissue but.</v>

1320
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:18.870
<v Speaker 2>But the activists or the anger creators </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they added the t and I asked,</v>

1321
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before this whole thing,</v>

1322
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.230
<v Speaker 2>what does t have to do with LG and be.</v>

1323
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:26.703
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a show on Sirius xm that was on </v>

1324
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:30.010
<v Speaker 3>the outcome channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lgbt channel,</v>

1325
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:30.963
<v Speaker 3>which I'm happy to say no longer exists </v>
<v Speaker 3>because gay people could have regular </v>

1326
01:05:33.761 --> 01:05:34.594
<v Speaker 3>radio shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm glad that progress came so that </v>

1327
01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:41.340
<v Speaker 3>there was no need for ghettoisation of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>radio channel just for gay people.</v>

1328
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.513
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted to be on the political </v>

1329
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:44.690
<v Speaker 3>channel anyway and they threw me on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gauge channel,</v>

1330
01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.730
<v Speaker 3>so I'm fine with how it all worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1331
01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:47.663
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do remember while I assume you </v>

1332
01:05:48.971 --> 01:05:51.770
<v Speaker 3>rather be on our political channel than </v>
<v Speaker 3>a gate channel,</v>

1333
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.630
<v Speaker 3>you're not defined by your gayness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is getting as I can.</v>

1334
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.033
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even doing that good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you rather be with someone a </v>

1335
01:05:58.901 --> 01:06:02.800
<v Speaker 3>little more fabulous than this if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were to sit across from a gay guy for an</v>

1336
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 3>hour?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1337
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:03.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1338
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.080
<v Speaker 3>you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be normal,</v>

1339
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.550
<v Speaker 3>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1340
01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like the word normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but normal</v>

1341
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 2>oil is not defined by your sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation.</v>

1342
01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what normal.</v>

1343
01:06:14.021 --> 01:06:14.854
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying heterosexual is more </v>

1344
01:06:16.391 --> 01:06:19.780
<v Speaker 2>normal by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually believe bisexual is the norm.</v>

1345
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.333
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very complex issue because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>every society prior to the Bible had </v>

1346
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality was accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is unknown,</v>

1347
01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:33.123
<v Speaker 2>this is truly an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't come up with this pro gay </v>

1348
01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:38.250
<v Speaker 2>professors did all the research for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1349
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:41.260
<v Speaker 2>so I know all about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I devoted.</v>

1350
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I devote a 17,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>word essay on this 30 years,</v>

1351
01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 2>25 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a revelation to me.</v>

1352
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:49.803
<v Speaker 2>I thought the Bible was merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing the anti gay feelings that </v>

1353
01:06:55.361 --> 01:06:59.680
<v Speaker 2>permeated surrounding society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was unique.</v>

1354
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.920
<v Speaker 2>The Bible said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

1355
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are as happy with boys.</v>

1356
01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean eight year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 year olds,</v>

1357
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:09.933
<v Speaker 2>just as a grown man is happy with a 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old girl if that says homosexuals </v>

1358
01:07:14.891 --> 01:07:17.260
<v Speaker 2>and heterosexuals are identical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1359
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.060
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1360
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:23.480
<v Speaker 2>but we are telling you we the Bible as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it were,</v>

1361
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible is telling,</v>

1362
01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:31.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confine your sexuality to your wife,</v>

1363
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 2>the Bible eroticized marriage.</v>

1364
01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:38.090
<v Speaker 3>So the line though that everyone goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1365
01:07:38.091 --> 01:07:39.590
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always say,</v>

1366
01:07:39.591 --> 01:07:41.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to butcher it slightly,</v>

1367
01:07:41.241 --> 01:07:43.680
<v Speaker 3>but don't lie with a man as you would a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

1368
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't lie with a woman that way.</v>

1369
01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:47.420
<v Speaker 3>So I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotten a little trick here,</v>

1370
01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:49.730
<v Speaker 3>isn't that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't I do a little talmudic trick?</v>

1371
01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:51.680
<v Speaker 3>That is its own music trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good.</v>

1372
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you got for that one?</v>

1373
01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:55.663
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1374
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.930
<v Speaker 3>don't lie with the women that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a problem.</v>

1375
01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I know the Hebrew,</v>

1376
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.670
<v Speaker 2>not exactly that is the way it's often </v>
<v Speaker 2>translated,</v>

1377
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:03.533
<v Speaker 2>but the Hebrew that I can get you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come on a do not lie </v>

1378
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.173
<v Speaker 2>with a male and then the key words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're very rarely translated </v>

1379
01:08:12.811 --> 01:08:13.644
<v Speaker 2>accurately or Michigan v Dot Shaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lighting's not as you would lie the </v>

1380
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 2>lines and it's plural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting.</v>

1381
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:25.580
<v Speaker 2>The lines of a woman do not lie with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>male,</v>

1382
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:28.670
<v Speaker 2>the lines of a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not what you,</v>

1383
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:33.050
<v Speaker 2>the gay person would do with a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what men do with women.</v>

1384
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.820
<v Speaker 2>But I almost had you there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You almost did,</v>

1385
01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:37.400
<v Speaker 2>but then you would have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I didn't know that,</v>

1386
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:40.630
<v Speaker 2>I would've thought to Shay that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>add you.</v>

1387
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.160
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>

1388
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.510
<v Speaker 2>let's move on to another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1389
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:43.423
<v Speaker 2>I think we got to where that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't agree more and that's also why </v>

1390
01:08:47.031 --> 01:08:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to discuss that with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I sent them.</v>

1391
01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.130
<v Speaker 2>We weren't going to fully agree on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1392
01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:53.020
<v Speaker 2>But I'm so afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes.</v>

1393
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.863
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't hear what might be your </v>

1394
01:08:56.331 --> 01:08:57.320
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1395
01:08:57.321 --> 01:08:59.390
<v Speaker 2>there are people on the right who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

1396
01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.730
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bothers me.</v>

1397
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.830
<v Speaker 2>There are people on the right who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>contempt for gays and and it's wrong.</v>

1398
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.710
<v Speaker 2>It's biblically wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's humanly wrong,</v>

1399
01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:11.100
<v Speaker 2>and it does bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1400
01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:12.243
<v Speaker 2>So in a weird way though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so trump on this must of give you a </v>

1401
01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:16.950
<v Speaker 2>little anxious because it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>

1402
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't care less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could not give me any,</v>

1403
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the supreme court has ruled it's,</v>

1404
01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:26.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a nonissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it must be.</v>

1405
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:29.850
<v Speaker 2>You asked in terms of that slippery </v>
<v Speaker 2>slope because it does give me an x,</v>

1406
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:32.930
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sure other than tweeting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

1407
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:34.550
<v Speaker 2>maybe one day he will tweet it.</v>

1408
01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:35.713
<v Speaker 2>I wish he would tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess Swat teachers can call kids in a </v>

1409
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:42.470
<v Speaker 2>lot of our schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys and girls anymore.</v>

1410
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.070
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like him to tweet that.</v>

1411
01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:46.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that.</v>

1412
01:09:46.951 --> 01:09:47.784
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a good segue to A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put the other one aside for a </v>

1413
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:50.354
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of the political correctness </v>

1414
01:09:50.961 --> 01:09:52.690
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is directly affect.</v>

1415
01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.553
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's been a sort of through line </v>
<v Speaker 2>of everything we've been talking about </v>

1416
01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:55.724
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also directly affected your </v>

1417
01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:59.450
<v Speaker 2>channels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the prager u channel you guys,</v>

1418
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:02.300
<v Speaker 2>and again you're doing videos to explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1419
01:10:02.301 --> 01:10:04.160
<v Speaker 2>I've watched many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of your videos.</v>

1420
01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:06.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm in one next month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1421
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:07.303
<v Speaker 2>so I've never seen any hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People could argue with some of the </v>

1422
01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:10.874
<v Speaker 2>facts if they want or they could argue </v>
<v Speaker 2>if maybe you're coming from a certain </v>

1423
01:10:13.461 --> 01:10:14.294
<v Speaker 2>political persuasion or any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never seen anything remotely </v>

1424
01:10:16.221 --> 01:10:17.054
<v Speaker 2>close to hate speech or hate trade or </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the stuff that would get you </v>

1425
01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:20.030
<v Speaker 2>banned or whatever.</v>

1426
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.760
<v Speaker 2>You guys were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't banned from twitter,</v>

1427
01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:24.740
<v Speaker 2>but you were restricted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted.</v>

1428
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Show it in schools or libraries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1429
01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.433
<v Speaker 2>it's mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a video on the origins of the </v>

1430
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Korean War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:37.010
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that restricted?</v>

1432
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.710
<v Speaker 2>So what's happening here with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1433
01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:40.573
<v Speaker 2>this show is on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to make the Youtube </v>

1434
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:44.840
<v Speaker 2>God's to angry day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't be angry,</v>

1435
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.573
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very look that I was sure the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Journal had a feature that </v>

1436
01:10:51.201 --> 01:10:53.360
<v Speaker 2>editorial on behalf for Prager </v>
<v Speaker 2>University,</v>

1437
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:54.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1438
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.230
<v Speaker 2>what does youtube doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you,</v>

1439
01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.093
<v Speaker 2>what are you nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of Wall Street Journal </v>

1440
01:10:58.671 --> 01:10:59.504
<v Speaker 2>people have break state Bret Stephens </v>
<v Speaker 2>system on a Kimberley strassel has done </v>

1441
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 2>one and and others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they know about us.</v>

1442
01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.370
<v Speaker 2>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you kidding?</v>

1443
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:11.263
<v Speaker 2>A youtube video units.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think is actually </v>

1444
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:14.934
<v Speaker 2>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leftists are meeting at the top of </v>

1445
01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:17.814
<v Speaker 2>youtube saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are all left this to </v>

1446
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 2>troll the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1447
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 2>the webs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the websites,</v>

1448
01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.050
<v Speaker 2>especially among those that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

1449
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.280
<v Speaker 2>And we're the biggest producer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative videos in the world.</v>

1450
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:36.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm $220 million views last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a serious number for anybody even</v>

1451
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:41.010
<v Speaker 2>for the left and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they know that we exist.</v>

1452
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.910
<v Speaker 2>And so if one bugs them then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1453
01:11:44.911 --> 01:11:46.030
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1454
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:47.161
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1455
01:11:47.161 --> 01:11:47.994
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad material or objectionable or </v>

1456
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:53.460
<v Speaker 2>hateful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they get enough of those,</v>

1457
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:55.350
<v Speaker 2>there's an algorithm that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1458
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 2>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got reports.</v>

1459
01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:00.210
<v Speaker 2>They don't think they sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't monitor them.</v>

1460
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:01.463
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get feedback and so leftist who </v>

1461
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.990
<v Speaker 2>want to shut us down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send this feedback,</v>

1462
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.420
<v Speaker 2>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once they're contacted,</v>

1463
01:12:09.421 --> 01:12:12.660
<v Speaker 2>once the Wall Street Journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they then had another editorial.</v>

1464
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.553
<v Speaker 2>They'd three editorials on behalf of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Prager University in the Wall Street </v>

1465
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big newspaper.</v>

1466
01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 2>And of course not one liberal newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

1467
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.863
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're not liberal there left a </v>

1468
01:12:25.201 --> 01:12:27.630
<v Speaker 2>liberal paper would come to our defense.</v>

1469
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:28.703
<v Speaker 2>So that to me is a great example of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between that freedom is </v>

1470
01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:35.790
<v Speaker 2>the biggest issue because it's free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech now we're talking about for.</v>

1471
01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is correct.</v>

1472
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:38.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they should.</v>

1473
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't even,</v>

1474
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.160
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1475
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 2>let's let the Nazis March in Skokie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illinois,</v>

1476
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:48.300
<v Speaker 2>which precedes your day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with that?</v>

1477
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a big Jewish area,</v>

1478
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 2>including a lot of survivors of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust,</v>

1479
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:54.650
<v Speaker 2>lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis in,</v>

1480
01:12:54.651 --> 01:12:57.490
<v Speaker 2>in their grave evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1481
01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:01.710
<v Speaker 2>had a march neonazis matter march there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1482
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:04.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the acl you fought on their behalf,</v>

1483
01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.690
<v Speaker 2>but now freedom of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so,</v>

1484
01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:09.960
<v Speaker 2>but we're not in that category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little Haiti or as you point out,</v>

1485
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:11.653
<v Speaker 2>there was something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the most hated video that </v>

1486
01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:15.030
<v Speaker 2>we've put out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1487
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:15.983
<v Speaker 2>I would never have predicted this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's going to be a wonderful </v>

1488
01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:18.720
<v Speaker 2>irony.</v>

1489
01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.553
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be our video on advocating that </v>

1490
01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:28.731
<v Speaker 2>men get married that has the most amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hateful comments directed against it.</v>

1491
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.793
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you guys also did a video on the </v>

1492
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:35.070
<v Speaker 2>electoral college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are with that.</v>

1493
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 2>What I saw was about what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>$40 million caught some fire on that,</v>

1494
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:39.174
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I see a lot of celebrities now </v>

1495
01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:45.630
<v Speaker 2>tweeting that it says white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of controlling everybody.</v>

1496
01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:48.330
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't have to repeat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole video.</v>

1497
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:49.183
<v Speaker 2>We'll put the link down below so people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get hold of this country was not </v>

1498
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:56.550
<v Speaker 2>found that to be a democracy was founded</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be republic and it was.</v>

1499
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:59.490
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean for people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have democracy?</v>

1500
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Is One man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one vote,</v>

1501
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:01.584
<v Speaker 2>that's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1502
01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:05.440
<v Speaker 2>A plurality determines everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were checks on,</v>

1503
01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.353
<v Speaker 2>on how it works in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most non democratic thing we is the </v>

1504
01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:13.540
<v Speaker 2>US Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1505
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 2>senator from Wyoming has the same vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a senator from California,</v>

1506
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:21.220
<v Speaker 2>although California has 50 times more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1507
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:23.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the way,</v>

1508
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I do believe if the left gets rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral college,</v>

1509
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.370
<v Speaker 2>they will vote to get rid of the Senate.</v>

1510
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then basically Wyoming and Montana </v>

1511
01:14:30.481 --> 01:14:32.730
<v Speaker 3>and all these places will have almost no</v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

1512
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:33.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the point of this was set up to </v>

1513
01:14:34.821 --> 01:14:39.821
<v Speaker 2>be the United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just America,</v>

1514
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.903
<v Speaker 2>it's states states now the left has </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken the word states' rights and they </v>

1515
01:14:45.711 --> 01:14:50.711
<v Speaker 2>have made it into a neo Nazi term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they did with almost every</v>

1516
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.903
<v Speaker 2>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis,</v>

1517
01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:52.933
<v Speaker 2>states rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1518
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the theory.</v>

1519
01:14:54.471 --> 01:14:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the theory there?</v>

1520
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that.</v>

1521
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:59.203
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then the federal government </v>

1522
01:15:00.201 --> 01:15:02.750
<v Speaker 2>cannot suppress your racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1523
01:15:02.751 --> 01:15:03.584
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could just use your own racist </v>

1524
01:15:05.471 --> 01:15:06.470
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1525
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1526
01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:07.933
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1527
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:09.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1528
01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:11.990
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what America was founded </v>
<v Speaker 2>to beat.</v>

1529
01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1530
01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that outside of this is amazing.</v>

1531
01:15:16.191 --> 01:15:17.024
<v Speaker 2>Outside of the four burroughs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four of the five boroughs of New York </v>

1532
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:24.740
<v Speaker 2>City and La and La County,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump won the country.</v>

1533
01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just outside of that.</v>

1534
01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

1535
01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:28.814
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you realize that's all you have to </v>

1536
01:15:30.471 --> 01:15:34.730
<v Speaker 2>win is New York and La and if there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral college,</v>

1537
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:37.820
<v Speaker 2>that's all you'll campaigning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Michigan,</v>

1538
01:15:37.821 --> 01:15:38.980
<v Speaker 2>how do you spell it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1539
01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:43.430
<v Speaker 2>So you'd really have a less democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the final analysis.</v>

1540
01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:49.850
<v Speaker 2>And you know that you have to appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 2>more people with an electoral college.</v>

1542
01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:50.960
<v Speaker 2>That's what they wanted.</v>

1543
01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1544
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:54.720
<v Speaker 3>the fact that trump got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it now,</v>

1545
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.680
<v Speaker 3>is it 3 million less votes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>5 million left.</v>

1546
01:15:57.570 --> 01:16:00.660
<v Speaker 3>So really you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that affects his mandate in</v>

1547
01:16:00.661 --> 01:16:02.580
<v Speaker 3>any way or just it is what it is</v>

1548
01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:06.260
<v Speaker 2>and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's like,</v>

1549
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:08.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it.</v>

1550
01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:09.123
<v Speaker 2>My team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our team had more home runs than the </v>

1551
01:16:12.561 --> 01:16:15.320
<v Speaker 2>other team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

1552
01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1553
01:16:16.761 --> 01:16:19.310
<v Speaker 2>There's other ways to score based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>home runs.</v>

1554
01:16:19.311 --> 01:16:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it were based on popular vote,</v>

1555
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:25.370
<v Speaker 2>he would have campaign in New York and </v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

1556
01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.940
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

1557
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.730
<v Speaker 2>you win or lose on the rules going in.</v>

1558
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you sense that because as you said </v>

1559
01:16:36.121 --> 01:16:38.940
<v Speaker 3>earlier that there's been nothing like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this before,</v>

1560
01:16:39.210 --> 01:16:42.480
<v Speaker 3>that there's incredible opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do good for the country right now.</v>

1561
01:16:42.481 --> 01:16:44.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that trump will grasp that </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

1562
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:46.490
<v Speaker 3>You sense that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>

1563
01:16:46.491 --> 01:16:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not support trump.</v>

1564
01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.360
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't support Hillary.</v>

1565
01:16:51.361 --> 01:16:53.850
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't like either one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think I said this publicly,</v>

1566
01:16:53.851 --> 01:16:55.700
<v Speaker 3>but I ended up voting for Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I wasn't,</v>

1567
01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:56.753
<v Speaker 3>which believe me I was not happy about </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think in a weird way he did the </v>

1568
01:16:59.491 --> 01:17:00.324
<v Speaker 3>most disservice to the country because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think if there was ever a year for a </v>

1569
01:17:02.641 --> 01:17:03.474
<v Speaker 3>libertarian to explain some classical </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal values and small government and </v>

1570
01:17:06.811 --> 01:17:07.644
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this was the year to get some </v>

1571
01:17:08.611 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 3>ideas out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat and he failed</v>

1572
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.390
<v Speaker 2>miserably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1573
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 2>but the day after the election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I didn't support trump,</v>

1574
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.820
<v Speaker 2>I suddenly felt like there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement here at least is the risk.</v>

1575
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>You can feel the tectonics shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you,</v>

1576
01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.970
<v Speaker 2>how do you take that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope in fact,</v>

1577
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:28.040
<v Speaker 2>that that will take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have.</v>

1578
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.540
<v Speaker 2>I now have hope change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:32.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1580
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 2>There's actual change now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1581
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1582
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1583
01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 2>he has one quality that I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care what the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>it says about him.</v>

1585
01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:50.540
<v Speaker 2>That's where as I believe all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>17 candidates did.</v>

1586
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 2>But what about the free speech stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him?</v>

1587
01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:53.624
<v Speaker 2>Because it's one thing to be for free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech when you're an opposition and </v>

1588
01:17:56.121 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 2>it's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now that he's the president,</v>

1589
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean fighting with the reporters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1590
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Do you not see that?</v>

1591
01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:02.963
<v Speaker 2>So I don't like a lot of these people do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know the main reporters and </v>

1592
01:18:05.601 --> 01:18:07.790
<v Speaker 2>suppressing free speech have nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with each other.</v>

1593
01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:08.653
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the president would go </v>

1594
01:18:09.891 --> 01:18:13.340
<v Speaker 2>after specific reporters or specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>publications,</v>

1595
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.383
<v Speaker 2>the chilling effect basically that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have over people that might be </v>

1596
01:18:17.211 --> 01:18:18.950
<v Speaker 2>critical of the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that as.</v>

1597
01:18:18.951 --> 01:18:19.784
<v Speaker 2>No because they don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get their viewers from the </v>

1598
01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:23.990
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the contrary,</v>

1599
01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:27.650
<v Speaker 2>for people on the left to be attacked by</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is a badge of honor,</v>

1600
01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.273
<v Speaker 2>that's not even a related issue and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>should go after them by name if they're </v>

1601
01:18:32.871 --> 01:18:34.130
<v Speaker 2>rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

1602
01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.000
<v Speaker 2>if he's rolling then he will look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if CNN reports,</v>

1603
01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:38.853
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what buzzfeed says and it's the only </v>

1604
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:45.910
<v Speaker 2>major network to report the buzzfeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I believe is a lie than,</v>

1605
01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 2>than CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I go on regularly.</v>

1606
01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:53.780
<v Speaker 2>So I have nothing against CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they should pay a price.</v>

1607
01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we need stronger liable </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws then?</v>

1608
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a free speech absolutist.</v>

1609
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:00.200
<v Speaker 2>You can say whatever you want as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned,</v>

1610
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:04.040
<v Speaker 2>but I'm starting to think that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1611
01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 2>we're now going back to what we said </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier about,</v>

1612
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people funding different websites,</v>

1613
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:10.670
<v Speaker 2>like just the system of constant lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1614
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.533
<v Speaker 2>not within the criteria for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for libel in America are almost </v>

1615
01:19:14.961 --> 01:19:16.190
<v Speaker 2>impossible to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.480
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've felt well mold before I,</v>

1617
01:19:19.481 --> 01:19:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I knew Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never watched the apprentice.</v>

1618
01:19:22.071 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know really anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1619
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt that this country.</v>

1620
01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things from England,</v>

1621
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:29.324
<v Speaker 2>England has stronger libel laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may be too strong a England has a </v>

1622
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:35.360
<v Speaker 2>loser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pays in courts,</v>

1623
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:38.320
<v Speaker 2>which I think should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be the issue in,</v>

1624
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:39.283
<v Speaker 2>in civil disputes and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody sues you and they turn out </v>

1625
01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:44.744
<v Speaker 2>to be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should you have had to pay your </v>

1626
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.890
<v Speaker 2>lawyer bills?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you would cut down the number of</v>

1627
01:19:48.891 --> 01:19:51.380
<v Speaker 2>frivolous lawsuits in this country by 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

1628
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I think there were things we could learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>from other systems.</v>

1629
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I think libel laws might be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:59.000
<v Speaker 2>If I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say,</v>

1631
01:19:59.001 --> 01:20:00.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1632
01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I saw you abusing children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1633
01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.250
<v Speaker 2>wha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should,</v>

1634
01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.230
<v Speaker 2>why should I not be brought to court for</v>
<v Speaker 2>libel?</v>

1635
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

1636
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:08.963
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't last two or three days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody wrote a on a fairly decent </v>

1637
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:16.830
<v Speaker 3>website that I'm a white supremacist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was about to publicly attack them.</v>

1638
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a white supremacist.</v>

1639
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.863
<v Speaker 3>This is like absurd beyond imagination </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought I can either now attack </v>

1640
01:20:22.201 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 3>them and get them to clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what they so desperately want.</v>

1641
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 3>In another situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had a lawyer and a ton of money,</v>

1642
01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess I could sue him for lab or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>Oregon,</v>

1643
01:20:30.221 --> 01:20:31.054
<v Speaker 3>just do nothing and let it be and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I did and I'm sure you could white </v>

1644
01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:33.984
<v Speaker 3>supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe that's an interesting </v>

1645
01:20:34.951 --> 01:20:36.300
<v Speaker 3>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a bunch of other things there,</v>

1646
01:20:36.301 --> 01:20:38.050
<v Speaker 3>but it will be close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1647
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.440
<v Speaker 3>if there was no evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say to me,</v>

1648
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:41.970
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll really love this.</v>

1649
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:44.270
<v Speaker 3>I get this comment a lot where somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>will come up with,</v>

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.960

<v Speaker 3>a book.</v>

1654
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:53.670
